        	<p>Of late, study of Hinduism is drawing the attention of scholars both on India and from other countries. However, books on general Hinduism covering all aspects are hard to find. This encyclopaedia is expected to remedy this problem to a considerable extent. The subjects dealt with are religion. philosophy, mythology, rituals, scriptural works, festivals and pilgrim centres, astrology, biographies of religious personalities, iconography temples and religious institutions. Buddhism Janism and Sikhism which are closely allied to Hinduism have also been dealt with briefly. It is earnestly hoped that the students of Hinduism will find this work useful in understanding the essence of Hinduism in the right spirit.</p>
