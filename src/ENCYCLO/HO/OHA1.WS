The river Sarasvat<200> of the Vedic fame is said to be seven in number. ç
They are: Suprabh<193>, K<193><210>can<193>k<218><200>, Vi·<193>l<193>, ç
Manoram<193>, Sarasvat<200>, Oghavat<200> and Sure<207>u.
These may be the seven names of the same river, of which Oghavat<200> ç
is also one.
The pur<193><207>as and the epics sometimes describe that Sarasvat<200>, ç
the divine river, manifested itself in seven places at different times ç
due to being invited by prayerful <216><218>is or sages. Oghavat<200> ç
was one of them that appeared in Kuruk<218>etra due to Vasi<218><219>ha's ç
prayer. It was on the bankof this river that the grandsire Bh<200><218>ma ç
lay on his bed of arrows and gave the great discourse contained in ç
the <185><193>ntiparva of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata (vide <185>alyaparva ç

@SPACE = 
Festivals and sacred days add colour and zest to life.
O<207>am  is  the  biggest  festival  of Kerala, practically, its ç
national festival. It occurs in the month of Ci<209>ga<221> (the ç
first month of the year according to the Malay<193><202>am Calendar) ç
(<185>r<193>va<207>a/Bh<193>drapada, August/September) when the sun ç
is in Si<221>halagna (Leo). Mah<193>bali or Bali, the great Asura ç
king, who once ruled this land, was pushed into the p<193>t<193>la ç
or netherworld by Vi<218><207>u as V<193>mana (5th incarnation in ç
the Da·<193>vat<193>ras) because of his pride. He was however permitted ç
to revisit his kingdom once a year and O<207>am is the day on which ç
he does it. O<207>am is a festival of flowers. Decoration with flowers ç
of various kinds and colours, in the form of concentric circles, in ç
front of the houses is a sight to see. These decorations start ten ç
days earlier. On the day of the O<207>am itself, clay images of ç
Bali and V<193>mana are kept, instead of the floral decorations, and ç
worshipped. A dance called Kaiko<219><219>ukali by the womenfolk ç
in the evening adds to the festive atmosphere. Another attraction ç
is the regatta or boat-races conducted at different places in the ç
State, the one at Aranmula being the most celebrated.

Places of pilgrimage are a source of inspiration and symbols of cultural ç
unity.
Among the well-known places of pilgrimage associated with lord <185>iva, ç
those containing the Jyotirli<209>gas (literally, `li<209>gas of light', ç
twelve in number, spread all over India) are considered extremely ç
sacred. The O<209>k<193>re·vara (the li<209>ga and the temple containing ç
it) is classed among these twelve.
The O<209>k<193>re·vara temple is situated on  the  M<193>ndh<193>t<193>  island  inside  the ç
Narmad<193> river, the two streams that surround it being known as ç
Narmad<193> and K<193>ver<200> (not the K<193>ver<200> of South ç
India). Inside it there are actually two <185>ivali<209>gas †O<209>k<193>re·vara  and  Amale·vara†both ç
considered as `Jyotirli<209>gas' but calculated as one only. The emperor ç
M<193>ndh<193>t<193> of the Ik<218>v<193>ku race (same as the Raghu-race) ç
is said to have realised Lord <185>iva here.
The area of this island is about 2.6 sq. kms. (1 sq. mile). The shape ç
of the island resembles that of <F38788P15W1J6><191><F255P255DJ0> (Om). Hence ç
the name `O<209>k<193>re·vara'.
It is said that the god Vindhya (the supervising deity of the Vindhya ç
mountains) once propitiated Lord <185>iva here through a yantra (sacred ç
geometrical diagram) and a li<209>ga of sand (or clay). Pleased with ç
his worship, <185>iva appeared before him and agreed to stay on in ç
those two forms. These two forms†the yantra and the earthen image†later ç
on became the two li<209>gas which we now see. The O<209>k<193>re·varali<209>ga ç
is a natural one (svayambh<220> or udbhava li<209>ga) and is surrounded ç
by water. Entrance to the temple is small. Images of P<193>rvat<200> ç
and fivefaced Ga<207>apati are also established inside the temple. ç

The temple can be approached by boat.
There are quite a few temples around the O<209>k<193>re·vara shrine, ç
on the island.

@S10 = INTRODUCTION
Oriental  Research  Institutes  are institutions specially devoted ç
to Indological studies. Indology is the science of study of Indian ç
Culture in all is aspects.
With  the  disappearance  of  the Gurukula system and the ancient ç
universities like those at N<193>land<193> and Tak<218>a·il<193> (Taxila, ç
now in Pakistan) as also the gradual dissolution of the powerful kingdoms ç
by conquests from outside, it became necessary to evolve a method ç
by which the ancient knowledge and wisdom of the East, especially ç
of India, could be revived and preserved.
It is the Western scholars of the 19th and the 20th centuries who ç
were mainly responsible for this revival, though many an Indian scholar ç
too has contributed considerably to it.
The work of these institutes consisted chiefly in collecting and collating ç
rare manuscripts in the oriental languages (like Pr<193>k<216>t and ç
Sanskrit) dealing with religion, philosophy, literature, grammar, ç
arts and sciences, editing them and publishing themwith or without ç
translations and explanatory notes.
Where and when such publications are not possible, the manuscripts ç
and other connected materials are preserved by using various modern ç
and scientific devices.
A brief account of these institutions may now be given.

@NOKX = Adyar Library and Research Centre<R>ç
(Madras<|>/<|>Chennai)
The Theosophical Society of Madras was started in <MS>A.<|>D.<D><|>1882 ç
at Adyar (a suburb of Madras) and the Library in <MS>A.D.<D> 1886 ç
by Col. Olcott (<MS>A.<|>D.<D><|>1832-1907). ThisLibrary has gradually ç
grown into a research centre in Oriental studies.
It now has 1,75,000 printed books and 18,600 manuscripts. Many of ç
these manuscripts have been procured from other countries also, like ç
China, Persia, Siam and Sri Lanka.
The printed books include old andrare Indological works on different ç
religions and philosophies, in languages like Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan ç
and Latin apart from Sanskrit and English.
The institution is bringing to light many rare and unpublished works ç
in itsAdyar Library Series. The publication of the series of 108 ç
Upani<218>ads with the Advaitic commentary of Upani<218>ad Brahmayog<200>ndra,  apart  from  several ç
<193>gamas, is a great achievement.
The Library also has been publishing a journal Brahmavidy<193> since ç
<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1937.
It gives all help and assistance to those scholars who intend to do ç
research and special study.

@NOKX = Asiatic Society
One of the good results of the British conquest of India is the deep ç
interest aroused in Indological studies in the Western intellectuals ç
and scholars. The person who gave an institutional frame-work to such ç
studies was Sir William Jones (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1746-94). He did it by ç
starting `The Asiatic Society' in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1794.
Jones was a fellow of the Royal Society, London. He came to India ç
as a puisne judge of the Bengal Supreme Court at Fort William (Calcutta). ç
Within months of his arrival he founded the society `in order to stimulate ç
and facilitate the enquiries of the ingenious, to provide the means ç
of preserving the numerous tracts and essays which otherwise would ç
be lostto the public, and to concentrate all the valuable knowledge ç
which might be obtained in Asia.' He was an Orientalist of repute ç
and hence was elected its first President. John Gilchrist, H. H. Wilson, ç
James Prinsep and Henry Colebrooke weresome of the other distinguished ç
Orientalists who served the Society as Secretary/President. Warren ç
Hastings andLord Wellesley who were Governors- General took a keen ç
interest in its activities and development during their tenure.
The  society  shifted  to  its  own premises in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1808. ç
An impressive nine- storied structure was put up in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1961-65 to house all its growing departments.
The name of the Society underwent several changes during the last ç
two centuries, such as: the Asiatick Society (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1784-1825); ç
The Asiatic Society (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1825-1832); The Asiatic Society ç
of Bengal (<MS>A.D.<D> 1832-1935); The Royal Society of Bengal ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1936-1951) and the Asiatic Society again since July ç
1951.
It was both an irony and a paradox that for many years the membership ç
of the Asiatic Society was not open to any Asian. It was exclusively ç
restricted to Europeans. Indian members began to be admitted only ç
as late as <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1829. Rajendralal Mitra was the first Indian ç
to hold the highest office of the President (<MS>A.<|>D.<D><|>1885).
@SPACE1 = 
The Society has an extensive library which includes books and journals ç
in almost  all  the  Asian  and  European Languages. It also has a ç
large collection of  valuable  manuscripts  in  Sanskrit, Persian, ç
Arabic, Tibetan, Burmese and a few Indian languages. It has brought ç
out several publications based on research conducted by competent ç
scholars. It is also publishing a journal, Journal of the Asiatic ç
Society.
The Society has been recognized as a research centre for Indological ç
studies in India and abroad.

@NOKX = Bhandarkar Oriental Research<R>ç
Institute (Pune)
This institute (often abbreviated as BORI) was started in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1917 at Pune to commemorate the life and works of R.G. Bha<207><195><193>rkar ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1875-1950), a distinguished pioneer of scientific Oriento-logy ç
in India.
It is a registered body and is managed by a Regulating Council as ç
also an Executive Board. It is financed by the governments of India ç
and Maharashtra as also the University Grants Commission.
Bha<207><195><193>rkar's personal library†a veritable treasury of ç
Oriental books and research journals†was presented to the institute ç
on the very day of its inauguration. It was further enriched by thetransfer ç
of a precious collectionof over 20,000 books in Sanskrit and Pr<193>k<216>t ç
manuscripts from the famous Deccan College, by the then Government ç
of Bombay Presidency.
The Institute is holding an All-India Oriental Conference every two ç
years in different centres of learning and the proceedings are published ç
regularly.
The Institute is also bringing out periodically, the Annals, containing ç
research papers. So far, more than seventy issues of this journal ç
have been published.
The library of the institution has now grown to 82,000 volumes of ç
very valuable books. It is available for use and consultation to students ç
and scholars interested in Oriental research.
By far, the crowning achievement of this famous institute is the publication ç
of the critical and illustrated edition of the epic Mah<193>bh<193>rata. ç
The project was started in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1919 and completed in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1966. History of Dharma·<193>stra by Dr. P. V. K<193><207>e and ç
the critical edition of the Hariva<221>·a (an appendix work of the ç
Mah<193>bh<193>rata) are the other two illustrious publications ç
that need mention.
The institute has its own printing press.
Bringing out descriptive catalogues of the manuscripts in its possession, ç
facilities for post-graduate research work in Indological subjects, ç
work on a comprehensive dictionary of Pr<193>k<216>t language as also ç
a cultural index of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata (based on the critical ç
edition) are the ongoing projects now.

in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1944.
At the initial stage, the Institute was engaged in coordinating the ç
activities of some of the institutions like the Oriental Research ç
Institute (under the University of Madras) and the Madras Samskrita ç
Academy. Later on, the objectives were expanded in scope to include ç
oriental learning and research in all its aspects. As a part of this, ç
it organises periodical meetings and conferences, conducts seminars ç
and maintains a good library.
It is located within the campus of theSanskrit College at Mylapore ç
(Madras/ Chennai).
It is bringing out a Journal of Oriental Research, of which 55 Volumes ç
have already seen the light of the day. Fifty important books and ç
monographs on subjects like astrology, medicine, literature and religion, ç
have also been published.
Its administration lies in the hands of a managing committee with ç
representatives from the Central and the State governments as also ç
from the Institute itself. This managing committee is ably assisted  by  a  research  committee  of ç
scholars.
The library of the Institute has 30,000 volumes, including periodicals ç
from India and abroad. The personal collections of many scholars have ç
enriched it over the years.
The Institute runs different courses like M.Phil., Ph.D. (both in ç

Under the orders of the Baroda Government, `The Oriental Institute' ç
formally came into being in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1927. Thetranslation branch ç
of the Education Department of the State was amalgamated with the ç
Institute in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1931. When the M. S. University of Baroda ç
was established in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1949, the Oriental Institute became ç
its constituent.
The Institute got its own building in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1958.
The main object of this Oriental Institute has been to develop a well-equipped ç
library of rare and unpublished manuscripts as also reference materialon ç
Oriental and Indological subjects. After proper scrutiny and editing, ç
some of them are being published. So far, 789 volumes have been brought ç
out, not only in Sanskrit but also in some other Indian languages ç
like Gujar<193>t<200> and Hind<200>. Persian and Arabic publications ç
too find a place in this series.
These books have been well-received in scholarly circles and have ç
also won accolades from distinguished institutions and authorities, ç
not only of India but also from abroad.
Another important work of the Institute is the publication of catalogues ç
of manuscripts.
@SPACE1 = 
There is a permanent exhibition of several interesting items of ancient ç

As a part of this, the Oriental Research Institute of Tirupati came ç
into being in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1941. When the Sri Venkateshwara University ç
was started in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1954, Tirupati became its seat. The Institute ç
was handed over to it in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1956.
The Institute promotes research and textual studies in the areas of ç
Sanskrit and Telugu as also philosophy, religion, ancient history ç
and culture. The following are the fields of its activities: publication ç
of rare manuscripts; preparation of well-documented and authenticated ç
reference-works like historical dictionaries, encyclo- paedic indexes ç
and anthologies; publication of a journal (Oriental Journal); preparation ç
of descriptive catalogues of manuscripts; a good library with important ç
books and journals as also some modern facilities; conducting diploma ç
courses in manuscriptology and epigraphy; holding of seminars and ç
summer courses in Indian culture.
The Institute has brought out sixtyfive books so far in Sanskrit, ç
English, Telugu and Tamil.
In <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1955, the fourth Sa<221>sk<216>ta Vi·vapari<218>ad ç
(Sanskrit Conference) was held under its auspices.
The institution moved into its own new premises in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1977, ç
now known as `Tirupp<193><207> °<202>v<193>r Bhavan'.
Its library now (in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1991) contains 26,000 printed books ç
and 17,000 Manuscripts. Facilities have been provided for research ç
work by scholars and specialists.
Some of the long-term projects taken up by the Institute are: An ç
Encyclopaedic Dictionary on Ancient Women; alphabetical index of ç
quotations given by the various commentators on the prasth<193>natraya, ç
called Ved<193>ntabh<193><218>yod<193>hara<207>ako·a; Pur<193><207>ako·a ç
(in Telugu); Ve<209>ka<219>e·vara Temples†A Study (in English); ç
Biblio-<~>graphy on the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (in English) and descriptive ç
catalogues of Sanskrit manuscripts.
A one-year Post-graduate Diploma Course (part-time) in epigraphy is ç
another useful activity of the Institute. Other courses in subjects ç
like manuscriptology are also being contemplated.

(Madras<|>/<|>Chennai)
The Samskrita Academy of Madras (now Chennai) was started in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1927 in the Senate Hall of the Old Senate building of the University ç
of Madras by Pa<207><195>it Madan Mohan M<193><202>av<200>ya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1861-1946). The well-known savant Kuppusv<193>mi <185><193>str<200> ç
(Kuppuswami Sastry [<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1880-1943]) was chosen as the first ç
president.
Still housed in the campus of the University of Madras, its various ç
objectives and activities include research in Sanskrit, publishing ç
a Sanskrit Journal (later on handed over to the Kuppusv<193>m<200> ç
<185><193>str<200> Research Institute), publication of critical editions ç
of important Sanskrit works, honouring Sanskrit scholars by awarding ç
fellowships  and  diplomas, creating  an Oriental Public Library, ç
organising periodical conferences of pa<207><195>its, conducting competitions ç
in Sanskrit literary activities, enacting Sanskrit dramas and arrangements ç
for teaching spoken Sanskrit.
It is also conducting free Sanskrit classes  and  awarding  scholarships  to ç
deserving students studying Sanskrit.
It has successfully celebrated Silver Jubilee (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1955), ç
Golden Jubilee (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1977) and Diamond jubilee (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1990) with various programmes.
It has brought out twenty books and monographs to popularise Sanskrit.
The academy has been quite active not only in propagating Sanskrit ç
but alsoin opposing anti-Sanskrit policies or movements especially ç
in Tamil Nadu.

@NOKX = Samskrita Sahitya Parishat<R>ç
(Calcutta<|>/<|>Kolkata)
This institution owes its origin to a handful of Sanskrit pundits ç
with limited financial resources but endowed with unlimited love and ç
zeal for the rich heritage of the country. Founded in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1916 in a tiny rented house, it is now housed in its own spacious ç
three storeyed building.
It has now become an advanced centre of Sanskrit learning andresearch.
It has all aspects of a typical research centre viz., teaching facilities, ç
a well-equipped library providing all opportu- nities for research, ç
publishing books after carefully scrutinising and editing the manuscripts ç
as also bringing out a journal of its own.
It provides for free teaching in its Catu<218>p<193><219>hi section ç
in subjects like Ved<193>nta, Navyany<193>ya, S<193><209>khya, Sm<216>tis, ç
P<193><207>ini and K<193>vya. Scholarships are also offered to meritorious ç
students.
The Pari<218>at can boast of possessing 20,000manuscripts, especially ç
on the subjects of dharma·<193>stras and Navyany<193>ya. Descriptive ç
catalogues of the manuscripts are almost ready for publication.
The library has 22,000 printed books which are easily available to ç
non-members also for reference work.
Another speciality of this library is that it is able to add photo ç
copies of extremely rare books also, whenever the originals are available.
The Pari<218>at is publishing a monthly Sanskrit journal of research ç
value. It has also brought out fifty important Sanskrit texts so far. ç
More are in the offing in the near future.
Work is now under progress on the famous work on Navyany<193>ya, the ç
Tattva-cint<193>ma<207>i of Ga<209>ge·a (circa <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1200) ç
with  the  commentary  May<220>kha.  The several Tattvas of Raghunandana ç
(16th Century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) are also in the process of being published ç
in due course.
Other activities of the institution include  honouring  veteran  and  great ç
scholars in Sanskrit, organising dramatic showsin Sanskrit for popularising ç
thelanguage and conducting classes on German language.

@NOKX = The Government Sanskrit College<R>ç
(Calcutta<|>/<|>Kolkata)
This College was established in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1824 by the East India ç
Company. Themethod of teaching Sanskrit was traditional. The subjects ç
taught too were the usual traditional ones like Ny<193>ya and other ç
systems of philosophy, grammar, astrology and <193>yurveda (health-sciences). ç
When ®·varacandra Vidy<193>s<193>gara (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1820-1898) became ç
its principal in 1851, he introduced the Western method of teaching ç
in the college.
In the publication section, 134 books have so far been published in ç
the Sanskrit College Series of Texts and Studies. They include original ç
texts, studies as also lexicons. The Paippal<193>dasa<221>hit<193> ç
in two parts and the Ch<193>ndogya Br<193>hma<207>a with the commentary ç
of Gay<193>vi<218><207>u are two of the most outstanding contributions ç
of this section.
The College is bringing out a bi- annual bulletin called Our Heritage ç
since <MS>A.D.<D> 1953.
The  post-graduate  and  research department started in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1951 is attracting serious students and scholars.

@NOKX = Sarasvati Mahal Library (Thanjavur)
Known to contain one of the largest and the most important collection ç
of Indian manuscripts in the world, the Sarasvat<200> Mahal Library ç
of Thanjavur (in Tamil Nadu) was probably established by the end of ç
the 16th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D> Its full official name is ``Thanjavur ç
Maharaja Serfoji's Sarasvati Mahal Library''.
Since it was originally under Telugu N<193>yaks, many of the Sanskrit ç
manuscripts are in Telugu script.
After the Maratha conquest in the 18th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>, there ç
was a phenomenal growth of the Library.
Later, it was Mah<193>r<193>ja Serfoji Rao who added a large number ç
of manuscripts as a result of his visit to V<193>r<193><207>as<200> ç
during the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1820-30.
This personal library of the Mah<193>r<193>jas was made a public trust ç
in <MS>A.D.<D> 1918.
The total number of manuscripts now exceeds 50,000. Quite a few of ç
these have been edited and printed.

@NOKX = Vishveshvaranand   Vishvabandhu Institute of Sanskrit and ç
Indological Studies (Hoshiarpur)
Two sa<221>ny<193>sins, Sv<193>mis Vi·ve·var<193>-nanda and Nity<193>nanda, ç
launched a project at Simla (now in Himachal Pradesh) in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1903 to prepare word-indices for the four principal Vedic Sa<221>hit<193>s. ç
After the passing away of Sv<193>mi Nity<193>nanda and after changing ç
the placeultimately to Lahore (now in Pakistan) in <MS>A. D.<D> 1923, ç
Sv<193>mi Vi·ve·var<193>nanda handed over the work and the project ç
to °c<193>rya Vi·va-bandhu.
By now, only the word-indices had been brought out and work had begun ç
on a Vedic lexicon. The °c<193>rya expanded the scope of the work ç
and finally succeeded in publishing the Vedic Word Concordance in ç
five volumes (subdivided into sixteen parts) running into 11,000 pages, ç
in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1965.
The Institute was originally known as `The Vishveshvaranand Vedic ç
Research Institute' (at Sadhu Ashram). The Punjab University took ç
it over in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1965 and renamed it as `TheVishveshvaranand ç
Vishvabandhu Institute of Sanskrit and Indological Studies' (VVBIS ç
& IS).
The Institute then took up the huge dictionary project. As projected, ç
it was to deal with 80,000 basic homonymic entries with 25 lakhs of ç
textual references.
After  receiving  the  reactions  of various scholars to the specimen ç
fascicule, the project was bifurcated into two streams, the former ç
being renamed as A Comparative and Critical Dictionary of Vedic Interpretation.
An Academic Committee was formed in <MS>A.D.<D> 1985 to assist in ç
this ambitious project. This committee changed the nameagain to: ç
`ADictionary of Vedic Interpretation'.
Apart from this project, the Institute is also preparing the critical ç
editions of the Vedic texts with the available, but unpublished, commentaries.
The Institute has already published some  rare  works  like  the  K<218>udra ç
Kalpas<220>tra,  °·val<193>yana  <185>rautas<220>tra, °pastamba  <185>ulbas<220>tra  and  V<193>dh<220>la ç
<185>rautas<220>tra.
There are other projects also like linguistic studies of the dialects ç
of North-Western region of India and a glossary of some Him<193>layan ç
dialects.
A few more projects are being vigo-rously pursued and may be completed ç
soon.
@S10 = EPILOGUE
India has a very rich religious and cultural heritage. It is of hoary ç
antiquity too. Even the <184>gveda, the oldest religio-literary ç
work in the world, has several references to much earlier episodes ç
and periods.
The epics and the pur<193><207>as†though apparently a mixture of myths ç
and realities†do contain quite a bit of ancient history. Discoveries ç
through the continuing archaeological excavations are adding more ç
and more knowledge to our store-house of ancient wisdom.
Hence   Indological   studies   and research have acquired even greater ç
relevance today.
The various institutions described above, are doing invaluable work ç
in this field and need much greater support and encouragement. Then, ç
their contribution to unearthing our ancient history can also influence ç
our present and future lives.
