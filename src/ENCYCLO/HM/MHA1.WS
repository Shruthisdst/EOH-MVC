@SPACE = 
Hindu scriptures describe six evil qualities of the mind which are ç
enemies in the path of moral and spiritual evolution and hence called ç
`ari<218>a<195>varga' (ari = enemy, <218>a<219> = six). Mada is one ç
of them and is generally placed as the fifth in the series.
Mada is intoxication born out of several factors. At the psychological ç
level it is translated as arrogance.
Some of the factors which produce this mada or arrogance are: vidy<193> ç
(learning),  dhana  (wealth),  kula  (lineage), yauvana (youth), bala ç
(physical strength), r<220>pa (beauty), r<193>jya (kingdom), pariv<193>ra ç
(large retinue) and adhik<193>ra (power).
Even tapas (austerities) and siddhis (psychic powers) can cause mada ç
if one is not careful and vigilant.

Mad<193>las<193> is one of the great womendescribed in the pur<193><207>as ç
(vide M<193>rka<207><195>eyapur<193><207>a 20-44) who was a devoted ç

She was the exquisitely beautiful daughter of the gandharva king Vi·v<193>vasu. ç
A demon, P<193>t<193>laketu by name, once abducted her but was rescued ç
by the prince <184>tadhvaja (also known as Kuvalay<193>·va) who married ç
her later. She remained extremely devoted and faithful to him.
Once when she was falsely informed that her husband had died, she ç
gave up her body immediately in extreme grief. She was however revived ç
by A·vatara, a n<193>ga king, whose sons were <184>tadhvaja's friends.
She is said to have been a great yogin<200> and imparted <193>tmaj<210><193>na ç

Vi<218><207>u is often described as the enemy of Madhu and Kai<219>abha, ç
two powerful demons. These demons were brothers. They emerged out ç
of the ears of Vi<218><207>u when he was sleeping and threatened to ç
kill Brahm<193>. Brahm<193> prayed to Mother K<193>l<200>, the presiding ç
deity of Vi<218><207>u's sleep. After she emerged out of Vi<218><207>u's ç
body, he woke up from his sleep and killed the two demons with his ç
discus. There was another demon Madhu, the son of the demoness Lol<193> ç
and father of Lava<207><193>sura. He was a great devotee of <185>iva ç
and had obtained a powerful trident from him, on the condition that ç
he should never use it against the devas or gods, nor harm the people ç
of the world. He built a city called Madhupura (or Madhur<193>) and ç
was ruling there. His queen was Kumbh<200>nas<200>. When his son Lava<207><193>sura ç
started transgressing dharma, he became disgusted, gave the trident ç
to him and went away for tapas or practising austerities.
Lava<207><193>sura was later killed by <185>atrughna, younger brother ç
of R<193>ma.
@NT = madhubh<220>mika
The Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.C.<D>) warns the ç
yogi that he must not succumb to the temptations of sth<193>nis†those ç
occupying celestial worlds like Indra†and should not also fall a prey ç
to egoism, in<|>the process of rejecting their offers (vide 3.51).
The commentator Vy<193>sa (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 600) divides the yogis into ç
four categories out of which the madhubh<220>mika (yogi) is the second. ç
He is the one who has attained <216>tambharapraj<210><193> (vide ç
Vy<193>sabh<193><218>ya on the Yogas<220>tras 1.48), and therefore ç
is capable of straightforward and truthful perception. The advice ç
in the s<220>tra 51 is meant for him.
@NT = Madhubr<193>hma<207>a
@EMERGENCY = The fifth br<193>hma<207>a or section of the second chapter ç
of the B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka Upani<218>ad  is  called  Madhubr<193>hma<207>a ç
because the word `madhu' has been used frequently (34 times).
@EMERGENCY = `Madhu' means honey. Since honeyis a k<193>rya or effect ç
produced by the honey-bees, and, being sweet and enjoyable, is liked ç
by everybody, anything that is liked by people can be compared to ç
madhu or honey.
@EMERGENCY = Since the five elements†earth, water, fire, air and space ç
or ether†as also other items of nature in creation like the sun, the ç
moon, the lightning are effects andare necessary for our existence ç
and sustenance, they are compared to madhu or honey.
@EMERGENCY = It is interesting to note that the Upani<218>ad has included ç
dharma (righteousness), satya (truth), m<193>nu<218>a (humankind) ç
as also the <193>tman in the list of madhus.
@NT = Madhucchandas
Every mantra or <216>k of the <184>gveda is attributed to some <216><218>i ç
or sage. He is the person through whom the mantra was revealed.
Madhucchandas, one of the sons of the famous sage Vi·v<193>mitra, ç
is the <216><218>i of the first ten s<220>ktas of the first ma<207><195>ala ç
of the <184>gveda. The total number of mantras or <216>ks in these ç
ten s<220>ktas is 102.
He has also been mentioned in theKau<218><200>taki Br<193>hma<207>a ç
(28.2) and the Aitareya °ra<207>yaka (1.1.3).
The <216><218>is to whom a hundred or more <216>ks were revealed, ç

@N1 = (`that which contains [the word] madhu')
Offering madhuparka†a liquid preparation containing a mixture of curds, ç
ghee, water, honey and sugar†to the <216>tviks or priests in a Vedic ç
sacrifice is an important way of honouring them. These <216>tviks ç
are expected to sanctify it by looking at it and repeating the three ç
<216>ks or verses starting with `madhu v<193>t<193> <216>t<193>yate' ç
and ending with `m<193>dhv<200>r g<193>vo bhavantu na<199>' (<184>gveda ç
1.90.6-8). Since all the three verses begin with the word `madhu' ç
they are together called `madhumat<200>' verses.
This repetition brings auspiciousness on the yajam<193>na or the sacrificer.
This procedure is mentioned in the °·val<193>yana G<216>hyas<220>tras ç
(1.24.5-26) as also in the P<193>raskara G<216>hyas<220>tras (1.3).
@NT = madhuparka
@N1KERN = (`offering mixed with honey')
An atithi or a guest has to be treated as if he is a god. Thus states ç
the Taittir<200>ya Upani<218>ad (1.11).
Honouring guests and elders as also holy persons has been a bounden ç
duty, especially for the g<216>hastha or the householder.
Madhuparka is an important item offered to such guests. It may be ç
prepared out of three materials (curds, honey and ghee) or five (curds, ç
honey, ghee, water and ground grain or sugar).
In the earliest days, flesh was one of these five items, but seems ç
to have been given up later when flesh-eating came to be abhorred.
The persons to whom madhuparka has to be offered, especially when ç
they come to one's house, are: <216>tvik (Vedic priest), <193>c<193>rya ç
(preceptor), bride-groom (during marriage), sn<193>taka (a student ç
of Vedic studies who has just graduated) and a king.
Elaborate rules have been given in the sm<216>tis as to the mode of ç
offering madhuparka and also in receiving and consuming it (vide ç
°·val<193>yana G<216>hya-s<220>tras 1.24.5-26).
The Kau·ikas<220>tras (92) dealing with the g<216>hya rites mentions ç
nine kinds of mixtures as fit to be offered like madhuparka.
For instance the br<193>hma mixture has honey and curds; the aindra, ç
p<193>yasa (pudding) only; saumya, curds and ghee; v<193>ru<207>a, ç
water and ghee and so on. Thesemixtures seem to be offered during ç
certain Vedic sacrifices like R<193>jas<220>ya and Sautr<193>ma<207>i.

@N1 = (`the sweet attitude')
@EMERGENCY = There is an innate hankering in every soul for enjoying ç
infinite bliss. Though all the four yogas recognise this, it is Bhakti-yoga ç
that gives us a more practical mode of s<193>dhana or spiritual discipline, ç
to attain this.
It is easier for a human being who is strongly encased in the body-mind ç
complex and hence terribly attached to it, to contemplate on God with ç
a form, a name and a personality of his own. The Hindu scriptures ç
including the Upani<218>ads describe God, not only as Sat (the eternal) ç
but also as °nanda (infinite bliss). He is also `Sundara' (the Beautiful) ç
as per the description in the Vi<218><207>usahasran<193>ma (no. ç
791) which is a part of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata. Hence he is the ç
fittest person to be loved.
Bhaktiyoga teaches several modes of loving God, of which madhurabh<193>va ç
or madhurabhakti is also one. It is the love that makes the devotee ç
look upon God as one's beloved and long for union with him. It is ç
this kind of love that the gop<200>s (cowherdesses) of V<216>nd<193>vana ç
of mythology or °<207><195><193><202> (one of the °<202>v<193>rs who ç

of the historical period practised in their lives, loving God as their ç
husband or beloved.

Rare are the savants who have simultaneously enriched the literature ç
on Advaita Ved<193>nta and bhakti or devotion to personal God. Madhus<220>dana ç
Sarasvat<200> was certainly an outstanding one among them.
Research scholars assign to him three dates: <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1490-1580; ç
<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1525-1632 and <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1490-1607.
He was the third son of Pramodana Purandar<193>c<193>rya of Bengal, ç
born probably at Una·iy<193> in the district Faridpur, now in Bangladesh. ç
His ancestors are said to have migrated from Kanauj in Uttar Pradesh.
As a boy, Madhus<220>dana was a brilliant student and learnt Sanskrit ç
grammar and poetry at the feet of his own father, who himself was ç
a great scholar.
He is believed to have renounced the world at the age of ten and travelled ç
all the way to Navadv<200>pa (in West Bengal) to meet <185>r<200> ç
K<216><218><207>a Caitanya, known widely as Caitanya Mah<193>prabhu. ç
Since Caitanya was away, he stayed on there itself and pursued his ç
studies of Ny<193>ya philosophy under Mathur<193>n<193>tha Tarkav<193>g<200>·a, ç
who was the foremost scholar of his times in that field.
He then proceeded to K<193>·<200> to learn Advaita Ved<193>nta under ç
R<193>mat<200>rtha and then the M<200>m<193><221>s<193> philosophy ç
under a sa<221>ny<193>sin,M<193>dhavaSarasvat<200>.These studies ç
produced an intense spirit of renunciation in him so much so that ç
he took sa<221>ny<193>sa from Vi·ve·vara Sarasvat<200>.
He is credited with the organising of a sect of militant monks, the ç
N<193>g<193> s<193>dhus, in order to protect the Hindu sa<221>ny<193>sins ç
and other Hindus.
He had three eminent disciples: Bala-bhadra Bha<219><219><193>c<193>rya, ç
<185>e<218>agovinda and Puru<218>ottama Sarasvat<200>.
He authored six important works. They are: Ved<193>ntakalpalatik<193>, ç
Siddh<193>nta-bindu, Bhaktiras<193>yana, Advaitasiddhi, Sa<209>k<218>epa·<193>r<200>rakavy<193>khy<193>, ç
Bh<193>gavata<219><200>k<193> and G<220><195>h<193>rthad<200>pik<193>.
Total number of works attributed to him are eighteen.
The Advaitasiddhi is his magnum opus. The G<220><195>h<193>rthad<200>pik<193> ç
is a lucid glosson <185>a<209>kara's commentary of the Bhagavadg<200>t<193>. ç
The Siddh<193>ntabindu is a scholarly commentary on the Da·a·lok<200> ç

`Too much is too bad!'†is a popular saying. Excessive intellectualism ç
can lead to a dryness of the heart. Exuberant emotionalism, on the ç
other hand, can generate superstition and fanaticism. It was given ç
to Madhv<193>c<193>rya†also known as P<220>r<207>apraj<210>a and °nandat<200>rtha†to ç
strike a delicate balance between these two extreme positions in Indian ç
philosophy as also in the society of his times.
The most authentic source of his life is the famous work Madhvavijaya ç
in Sanskrit by N<193>r<193>ya<207>a Pa<207><195>ita (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1287-1350) who was a junior contemporary of the <193>c<193>rya himself. ç
He was the son of Trivikrama Pa<207><195>ita who was an advaitin first ç
but was converted to dvaitism by the <193>c<193>rya.
According to the dvaita tradition, Madhv<193>c<193>ryawasanincarnationof ç
Mukhyapr<193><207>a (same as Hira<207>yagarbha, also known as V<193>yu ç
and S<220>tr<193>tman, an emanation of Lord Vi<218><207>u), who had ç
incarnated earlier as M<193>ruti (Hanum<193>n) and Bh<200>ma(the ç
middle one among the P<193><207>dava brothers).
He was born in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1238 as the son of Madhyageha Bha<219><219>a ç
at the village P<193>jaka or P<193>jakak<218>etra, in the State of ç
Karnataka, near the city of Mangalore. He was given the name `V<193>sudeva' ç
during the n<193>makara<207>a (naming) ceremony. Even as a child he ç
exhibited many miraculous powers like clinging to the tail of a bull ç
which was grazing in bushy fields, for several hours, converting tamarind ç
seeds into gold and giving them to the person to whom his own father ç
was indebted, thus discharging him from his debt, spending several ç
days in the N<193>r<193>ya<207>a temple in the forest of Ka<195>uv<220>r ç
all alone, correcting a br<193>hma<207>a pundit who was reciting the ç
pur<193><207>as wrongly and so on.
After his upanayana, he was put under the care of a preceptor. However, ç
V<193>sudeva spent most of the time in manly sports like running, ç
wrestling and swimming rather than attending the classes. When the ç
teacher objected, he showed him that he knew all that was taught and ç
also where the teacher was wrong!
@SPACE1 = 
At the age of sixteen V<193>sudeva took sa<221>ny<193>sad<200>k<218><193>(monastic ç
vows)from Acyutaprek<218>a, the pontiff of a monastery at K<193>re ç
near the modern town of U<195>upi. He was given the new name `P<220>r<207>apraj<210>a'.
The new ascetic began to receive instructions in the doctrines of ç
Advaita Ved<193>nta according to the famous work I<218><219>asiddhi ç
of Vimukt<193>tman (10th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>). However, serious ç
differences cropped up between the teacher and the disciple very soon. ç
Being astounded by the sharp memory and remarkable scholarship of ç
the disciple, Acyutaprek<218>a gave him another name `°nandat<200>rtha' ç
and also made him the pontiff of his monastery. `Madhva or Madhv<193>c<193>rya' ç
seems to be a synonym of his real name. However it is this name that ç
seems to have become more common and popular.
During the next few years, Madhv<193>-c<193>rya battled with many ç
a scholar†most of whom were arrogant due to their learning†defeated ç
them and converted them to his own views.
He then undertook a pilgrimage of South India. Along with visiting ç
the holy places he also utilised this opportunity for spreading his ç
views on the basic texts of Ved<193>nta. At one of the meetings during ç
this tour, he was challenged by some scholars to explain the scriptures. ç
Madhv<193>c<193>rya by the dint of his scholarship and eloquence showed ç
that each Vedic s<220>kta had three meanings, the Mah<193>-bh<193>rata ç
ten, and that each name of the Vi<218><207>usahasran<193>ma had ç
a hundred!

1017-1137) convinced him now, of the need to found a new school of ç
thought of Ved<193>nta. During his next trip to North India, he is ç
said to have visited the famous place of pilgrimage, Badar<200>. There, ç
he proceeded to the inaccessible regions of upper Badar<200>, met ç
Vedavy<193>sa who lived there with his disciples, invisible to the ç
ordinary run of humanity, and, received his instruction about the ç
true meaning of the Brahma-s<220>tras as also the Mah<193>bh<193>rata ç
and the P<193><210>car<193>tra °gamas, all of which were composed ç
by him to establish the glory of N<193>r<193>ya<207>a. He then wrote ç
his commentary on the Brahmas<220>tras and travelled back to South ç
India.
During this second sojourn in this part of the country, he won over ç
two great scholars†<185>obhana Bha<219><219>a of the God<193>var<200> ç
region and Sv<193>mi <185><193>stri from Kali<209>ga† and gave them ç
sa<221>ny<193>sa. They were renamed Padman<193>bha T<200>rtha and ç
Narahari T<200>rtha. They, later on, wrote commentaries on Madhv<193>c<193>rya's ç
works.
It was at this time that Acyutaprek<218>a (his guru) became the disciple ç
of this illustrious disciple.
During the period of his stay at U<195>upi, he discovered the image ç
of <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a which was imbedded in a huge lump ç
of mud (called gop<200>candana). He got it washed in a nearby lake ç
and himself carried it to his monastery. It was during this procession ç
that he composed, out of divine inspiration, the now well-known Dv<193>da·astotra, ç
twelve stanzas on Lord V<193>sudeva (or <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a). ç
As per this hymn, this image had been prepared by the divine architect ç
and sculptor Vi·vakarma and that it had been worshipped by the gop<200>s ç
of V<216>nd<193>vana as also the queen Rukmi<207><200>.
He then got a temple built and installed this image there.
@SPACE1 = 
During this period of stay at U<195>upi, he reformed the ways of sacrificial ç
rites, introduced the use of animal forms made of a paste of black ç
gram powder and ghee instead of real animals and included them in ç
devotional disciplines.
He went on a second pilgrimage to Badar<200> during which trip, performed ç
many more miracles like casting a spell on a Turkish Muslim chieftain, ç
routing bands of thieves and robbers, walking effortlessly on the ç
water of the river Ga<209>g<193> and throwing away a huge tiger that ç
tried to attack his party. He is also said to have shown the gad<193> ç
(mace) which he had used in his previous incarnation as Bh<200>ma.

(the Madhvavijaya) may be taken to show that the <193>c<193>rya ç
was a giant both physically and intellectually as also in yogic powers.
When he was staying at U<195>upi, the manuscripts of his works were ç
stolen by rival scholars but were recovered in a miraculous way.
It was during this period that he won over a great scholar†Trivikrama ç
Pa<207><195>ita †after defeating him in a long fought battle of wit ç
and scholarship. At his command, Trivikrama later wrote an elaborate ç
explanatory commentary on the Brahmas<220>trabh<193><218>ya of his ç
guru.
@SPACE1 = 
Since he was very particular that the worship of Lord K<216><218><207>a ç
in the temple he had established at U<195>upi should go on smoothly ç
and unhindered, he gave that responsibility to his eight sa<221>ny<193>sin ç
disciples. They established their ma<219>has or monasteries round ç
the temple and took turns to shoulder that responsibility, each of ç
the pontiffs getting a two-year term. These eight ma<219>has known ç
as `A<218><219>ama<219>has', are Adam<193>ru Ma<219>ha, K<193><207>iy<220>ru ç
Ma<219>ha, K<216><218><207><193>pura Ma<219>ha, Palim<193>ru Ma<219>ha, ç
Pej<193>vara Ma<219>ha, Puttige Ma<219>ha, <185><200>r<220>ru Ma<219>haandSodeMa<219>ha. ç
Thefirst pontiffs of these Ma<219>has, respectively, were:Narasi<221>hat<200>rtha, ç
V<193>manat<200>rtha, Jan<193>rdanat<200>rtha, H<216><218><200>ke·at<200>rtha, ç
Ak<218>obhyat<200>rtha, Upendrat<200>rtha, R<193>ma-t<200>rtha and ç
Vi<218><207>ut<200>rtha.
Having intuitively felt that he had finished his work, Madhv<193>c<193>rya ç
is said to have mysteriously disappeared from his seat, while teaching ç
the Aitareya Upani<218>ad to his disciples, leaving a big heap of ç
flowers on it.
As regards the personality of Madhv<193>c<193>rya, the Madhvavijaya ç
describes him as very strong with handsome features. He was endowed ç
with a photographic memory, astounding scholarship and a powerful ç
oratory. His voice was sonorous and suited the chanting of Vedic and ç
other mantras.
A vast body of 37 works is attributed to him. Only a few of the more ç
important ones may be mentioned here:
Bh<193><218>yas on all the ten well-known Upani<218>ads;
Bhagavadg<200>t<193>bh<193><218>ya; Bhagavadg<200>t<193>-t<193>tparyanir<207>aya; ç
Brahmas<220>trabh<193><218>ya; A<207>ubh<193><218>ya on the Brahmas<220>tras; ç
Anu-vy<193>khy<193>na, also on the same work; M<193>y<193>-v<193>dakha<207><195>ana; ç
Vi<218><207>utattvavinir<207>aya; Sad<193>c<193>rasm<216>ti; Yatipra<207>avakalpa; ç
Mah<193>bh<193>ratat<193>tparyanir<207>aya; Dv<193>da·a-stotra ç
and <184>gvedabh<193><218>ya (first ma<207><195>ala's forty s<220>ktas ç

Madhv<193>c<193>rya advocated dualism and realism. His philosophy ç
accepts pa<210>ca-bhedas or five kinds of bhedas (differences) which ç
are real and permanent. They are: ®·vara or God is different from ç
the j<200>vas or souls; he is also different from the ja<195>a (insentient ç
nature, prak<216>ti); the various j<200>vas are different from one ç
another; the j<200>vas are different from the ja<195>a; the various ç
objects which are ja<195>a, are also different from one another.
He accepts God, called N<193>r<193>ya<207>a or Vi<218><207>u or <185>r<200>hari, ç
as the Supreme Reality and the others as dependent realities. Mukti ç
or liberation, which is regaining one's blissful nature, can be got ç
only through bhakti or devotion to God.
The illustrious successors of Madhv<193>-c<193>rya like Jayat<200>rtha ç
(circa <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1250) and Vy<193>sar<193>ya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1478-1539) ç
as also R<193>ghavendrat<200>rtha (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1595-1671) have kept ç
up the Dvaita Ved<193>nta philosophy alive. The saints of the D<193>sak<220><219>a ç
(See <MS>D°SAK<188><187>A<D> for details.) have nourished the tradition ç
of bhakti or devotion to God as K<216><218><207>a (N<193>r<193>ya<207>a ç
or Vi<218><207>u).
The contribution of Madhv<193>c<193>rya to Hindu philosophy and to ç
the cult of bhakti is remarkable.

The sage K<216><218><207>advaip<193>yana†more well-known as Vy<193>sa ç
or Vedavy<193>sa†took the trouble of collecting all the Vedic mantras ç
available during his time and edited them, dividing them into four ç
groups or sections to suit the smooth conduct of Vedic sacrifices. ç
He then taught these four to his four chief disciples: Paila, Vai·amp<193>yana, ç
Jaimini and Sumantu. The Vedas they received came to be known respectively, ç
as <184>gveda, Yajurveda, S<193>maveda and Atharvaveda.
Y<193>j<210>avalkya, the most brilliant of the students of Vai·amp<193>yana, ç
separated from him due to serious differences of opinion and got a ç
different version of the Yajurveda directly from the Sun-god who ç
taught him assuming the Hayagr<200>va form (human frame with a horse's ç
head). This Veda came to be known as <185>ukla Yajurveda. He taught ç
it to his fifteen disciples of whom the sages Ka<207>va and Madhyandina ç
were, perhaps, more prominent.
When these two disciples re-edited the <185>ukla Yajurveda, it got ç
bifurcated into two ·<193>kh<193>s or branches which came to be known ç
by their names, viz., the K<193><207>va-·<193>kh<193> and the M<193>dhyandina·<193>kh<193>.
The M<193>dhyandina·<193>kh<193> or recension is more popular in ç
North India and the K<193><207>va in the South. It has 40 adhy<193>yas ç
or chapters and 1975 mantras. It is smaller than the K<193><207>va ç
recension.
The B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka Upani<218>ad is found in both the ç
recensions.

@NT = Madurai
@N1 = (`that [which is sweet like] honey')
One of the famous places of pilgrimage in South India, Madurai†also ç
spelt as Madhurai or Madhur<193>†is 461 kms. (286 miles)to thesouth-westof ç
Chennai (Madras) and is situated on the bank of the Vaigai river. ç
It is famous for its majestic temples, especially those of M<200>n<193>k<218><200> ç
(an aspect of the Divine Mother P<193>rvat<200>) and Sundare·vara ç
(<185>iva).
The city itself is very ancient and the rulers of the P<193><207><195>ya ç
dynasty who are mentioned even in the edicts of A·oka (circa 272-232 ç
<MS>B.<|>C.<D>), had business contacts with the Roman empire. It was ç
also an ancient seat of Tamil learning with 48 poets adorning the ç
Sa<209>gam or college hall. However, the modern Madurai attained the ç
present state of progress and civilisation under the N<193>yak kings.
@SPACE1 = 
According to the sthalapur<193><207>a (local lores) Indra, the king ç
of the gods, after his defeat at the hands of V<216>tr<193>sura, was ç
roaming about as a human being in a forest. At a particular spot he ç
felt great peace and happiness. There, he found a <185>ivali<209>ga ç
andworshipped Lord <185>iva through it. He immediately had a vision ç
of <185>iva and got back his royal throne through <185>iva's grace. ç
It is at this spot that the local king built his capital cityand ç
named it Madhur<193> as per the wonderful dream he had, in which he ç
saw am<216>ta or nectar being poured over the place (madhu= sweet; ç
honey; nectar).
Regarding the goddess M<200>n<193>k<218><200> there is another interesting ç
story. She was P<193>rvat<200> reborn as the daughter of the P<193><207><195>yan ç
king Malayadhvaja. Since her eyes resembled a m<200>na (fish) she ç
was given the name `M<200>n<193>k<218><200>' (one whose eyes resemble ç
a fish). She succeeded him as the ruler of the kingdom, routed all ç
the enemies and established her supremacy. She fell in love with Sundare·vara ç
(<185>iva, born as a human being) and was married to him. Vi<218><207>u ç
himself acted as the brother of M<200>n<193>k<218><200> in this marriage. ç
He is known as `A<202>ahar'. His temple is at the foot of a hillock, ç
at a distance of 21 kms. (13miles) from Madurai.
The most important of the several temples is the M<200>n<193>k<218><200> ç
temple complex situated on a site 258 metres (850 ft.) by 241 metres ç
(700 ft.). There are two main shrines, dedicated to M<200>n<193>k<218><200> ç
and Sunda-re·vara (<185>iva), no less than twelve gopurams (towers), ç
a tank and a large number of ma<207><195>apas or halls. The actual ç
dimensions of the twin shrines along with the various halls and associated ç
structures is 68.5 metres (22<%12>5<%0>ft.) by 45.7 metres (150ft.)
@SPACE1 = 
The sanctum sanctorum of the goddess M<200>n<193>k<218><200> is ç
a square of 10.4 metres (34 ft.). Elephants, lions and dwarfs are ç
shown as supporting the structure. On the outer walls, there are prominent ç
niches projecting to a length of 1.8 metres (3 1/4 ft.) and containing ç
many images like the Li<209>godbhavam<220>rti (<185>iva emerging out ç
of the li<209>ga), Dak<218>i<207><193>m<220>rti (an aspect of <185>iva) ç
and Durg<193>. The vim<193>na (small tower) above the sanctum has ç
three storeys.
The lovely Golden Lily tank, the Citragopura  with  740  sculptures,  the ç
°yirakk<193>l or thousand-pillared ma<207><195>apa, murals and paintings ç
including a museum, the musical pillars (of stone) and a six-pillared ç
dhvaja-stambha or flagstaff are the other attractions.
The Tirumala N<193>yak palace (called the Mahal), temple of A<202>agar ç
or A<202>ahar, the M<193>riamman Teppakulam (tank)† these are the ç
other attractions.
The main festivals are: the marriage of the goddess with Sundare·vara ç
during April/May, coronation of Lord Sunda-re·vara during August/September, ç
and the teppotsava or float-festival in January/ February.

Mah<193>balipuram†also known as M<193>mall<193>puram†is a famous place ç
of archaeological monuments situated at a distance of 50 kms. (31 ç
miles) to the south of Madras or Chennai. It was an important port-city ç
during the early Christian era and maintained trade relations with ç
many countries like the ancient Rome, Persia and China. Old coins ç
of these countries have been found at this place.
It became an important religious centre during the period of Narasi<221>ha ç
Varma, a Pallava king (circa <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 630-668). Since he was ç
known as M<193>malla, the city too got the name after him.
@EMERGEN1 = The most important monuments at Mah<193>balipuram are: ç
the shore temple; five rathas or monolithic temples; relief figure ç
of Arjuna, the P<193><207><195>ava hero, doing penance, by the side ç
of a river, carved on a big rock; a few cave temples containing the ç
images of Vi<218><207>u, Var<193>ha and Durg<193> as Mahi<218>amardin<200>.
@EMERGEN1 = The shore-temple in the Dravi<195>ian style is of solid ç
stone masonry. It had, originally, a massive wall surrounding it. ç
Now, only some of its remains are seen. It is remarkable that this ç
temple, with two vim<193>nas (small towers) has successfully withstood ç
the fury of the waves of the ocean and the vagaries of treacherous ç
weather for over twelve centuries. There are actually three shrines ç
here, two <185>aiva and one Vai<218><207>ava, depicting Vi<218><207>u ç
lying on the serpent Ananta.
@EMERGEN1 = Apart from the shore-temple, the rathas (chariot-like ç
temples) are of great importance. Five of them standing in the names ç
of the four P<193><207><195>avas (Dharmar<193>ja, Bh<200>ma, Arjuna ç
and Sahadeva) and their spouse, Draupad<200>, are monoliths of great ç
beauty. Out of these Dharmar<193>ja-ratha is the grandest.

R<193>m<193>ya<207>a and Mah<193>bh<193>rata, the two great epics ç
of India, have captivated the hearts of its people for several millennia. ç
Whether it is literature†both Sanskrit and  vernacular†arts,  crafts,  painting, ç
music,  dance  and  drama,  or  temple motifs, no aspect of Indian ç
culture has escaped the stamp of their influence. The simple village ç
folk who shed tears while listening to the ballads on the banishment ç
of S<200>t<193> or the highly skilled artisans working on the temple ç
motifs depicting the Kuruk<218>etra war, are both responding to a ç
dynamic and continuing culture of these epics.
Hindu tradition has always considered these two epics as itih<193>sa ç
(`verily did it exist thus') or history. Modern scholars have largely ç
conceded that the core of the epics could have had a historical basis.
@SB = Date and Authorship
@EMERGENCY = Reputed scholars, both Eastern and Western, have battled ç
for years to fix the date of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata war, also known ç
as the Kuruk<218>etra war. Incidentally this would also fix the date ç
of its heroes and, of course, their historicity. If the meti- culously ç
preserved Hindu oral traditions based on their notion of time as the ç
yuga- system are to be relied upon, the great war should have taken ç
place during 3139 <MS>B. C.<D> Writings of Megasthanes (312 <MS>B. ç
C.<D>) as also internal astronomical evidence corroborate this date. ç
Modern historians, however, have assailed this theory and are inclined ç
to accept a much later date, viz., 1424 <MS>B. C.<D> or 950 <MS>B. ç
C.<D>
Traditional lore ascribes the authorship of this epic to the great ç
sage Veda- vy<193>sa, also known as K<216><218><207>a Dvaip<193>yana. ç
He was a contemporary of the grandsire Bh<200><218>ma and had a firsthand ç
knowledge of most of the events described in the epic. Research-scholars, ç
however, feel that the original work called Jaya, written by Vy<193>sa ç
to commemorate the victory (jaya<|>=<|>victory) of the P<193><207><195>ava ç
princes over the wicked Kauravas, might have been a much smaller work ç
comprising about 8,800 verses. This was subsequently revised and enlarged ç
into Bh<193>rata, a work of 24,000 verses, by Vai·amp<193>yana, ç
a disciple of Vy<193>sa, and recited during the Sarpay<193>ga (serpent ç
sacrifice) of Janamejaya, the great-grandson  of  the  P<193><207><195>ava  hero ç
Arjuna. The final edition that has come down to us is the work of ç
S<220>ta Ugra·ravas, son of Lomahar<218>a<207>a (also spelt as Romahar<218>a<207>a), ç
and was recited at the Sattra-y<193>ga (a kind of sacrifice, the performance ç
of which is spread over several years) of the sage <185>aunaka in ç
the Naimi<218>a forest. It is this that has been called Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
due to the immense size (mah<193> = great) and its dealing with the ç
story of the people of the race descended from the ancient emperor ç
Bharata, culminating in the war. This edition is reputed to be `<185>atas<193>hasr<200> ç
Sa<221>hit<193>,' a collection of 100,000 verses, though the extant ç
text contains less. The round figure is obviously an approximation. ç
Some scholars have tried to establish that the epic has evolved over ç
a period of eight centuries (from 400 <MS>B.C.<D> to <MS>A.D.<D> 400) ç
to its present proportions. At the present stage of the research it ç
has not been possible to clinch the issue, and hence chronological ç
questions continue to remain open to discussions.
@SB = Recensions and Commentaries
Different regions of India have preserved different recensions of ç
the text of this epic. These have been broadly classified as the Northern ç
and the Southern recensions. Scholars opine that the latter which ç
is the longer of the two is more impressive because of its precision ç
andschematization as also its practical outlook. One of the standard ç
editions published contains 95,826 ·lokas or verses, in 18 `parvans' ç
or books, with 107 sub-parvans and 2,111 chapters in all, including ç
the appendix Hariva<221>·a. This just gives an idea of the immensity ç
of this epic poem, which is eight times as big as Homer's Iliad ç
and Odyssey put together.
Since the text contains quite a few riddles known as k<220><219>a·lokas ç
and vast portions  of  didactic  material,  several commentators have ç
tried their skill on it. The gloss of N<200>laka<207><219>ha (14th ç
cent.) is more well-known and is widely referred to.
@SB = Analysis of the Contents
The contents of the eighteen major books may be briefly summarized ç
as follows: °diparva, the first book, is fairly long  and  deals  with  several  ancient ç
episodes connected with <185>ukr<193>c<193>rya, the preceptor of the ç
asuras, and his intractable daughter Devay<193>n<200>, and Yay<193>ti, ç
a prominent king of the lunar dynasty, as also the famous romance ç
of <185>akuntal<193> and the king Du<218>yanta. However, the major ç
part of the book is devoted to the story of the ancestors of the P<193><207><195>avas ç
and the Kauravas like <185>antanu, Bh<200><218>ma, Vicitra-v<200>rya, ç
Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra and P<193><207><195>u; the birth and education ç
of P<193><207><195>avas and Kauravas; their early rivalries; marriage ç
of Draupad<200>, the P<193><210>c<193>la princess, to the P<193><207><195>avas; ç
Arjuna's pilgrimage and marriage with Subhadr<193>, sister of <185>r<200> ç
K<216><218><207>a.
Sabh<193>parva, the second, deals mainly withtheperformance oftheR<193>jas<220>ya ç
sacrifice by Yudhi<218><219>hira, the eldest of theP<193><207><195>ava ç
princes, the game of dice manoeuvred by the wily Duryodhana, the eldest ç
of the Kauravas, and its tragic consequences for the former.
Ara<207>yaparva, also called Vanaparva (and sometimes as °ra<207>yakaparva) ç
is the third book that covers the story of the P<193><207><195>avas ç
in exile in the K<193>myaka forest. This voluminous book is replete ç
with several stories from the past like those of Nala and Damayant<200>, ç
S<193>vitr<200> and Satyav<193>n, of sages like <184><218>ya·<216><209>ga, ç
Agastya and M<193>rka<207><195>eya, as also of kings like Bhag<200>ratha ç
and <185>ibi. The famous quiz, Yak<218>apra·na, belongs to this ç
book.
Vir<193><219>aparva, the fourth, is one of the smaller books dealing ç
mainly with the stay of the P<193><207><195>avas incognito in the ç
kingdom of Vir<193><219>a. Slaying of the villain K<200>caka and the ç
battle for rescuing the cattle of the king Vir<193><219>a which had ç
been captured by the Kauravas to force the P<193><207><195>avas to ç
come out of their hiding, as also the wedding of the Vir<193><219>a ç
princess Uttar<193> with Abhimanyu, Arjuna's son, are the chief incidents ç
portrayed here.
Udyogaparva, the fifth, is also a short book which deals with the ç
peace parleys and preparations for the war, curiously going together. ç
The most touching scene of Kunt<200>, the mother of the P<193><207><195>avas, ç
disclosing to Kar<207>a the secret of his birth in her womb, and the ç
statesmanship of <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a, who makes a last minute ç
bid for peace, are the highlights of this section. The famous discourse ç
of the sage Sanatsuj<193>ta to the blind king Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra, ç
well-known as the Sanatsuj<193>t<200>ya, which is full of philosophical ç
truths, forms a part of this book.
The next book, Bh<200><218>maparva, contains the crown-gem of the ç
epic, viz., the Bhagavadg<200>t<193>. Detailed descriptions of the ç
first ten days of the war containing the superhuman exploits of the ç
grandsire Bh<200><218>ma, ultimately ending in his being mortally ç
wounded by Arjuna, form the bulk of this section. Since Bh<200><218>ma ç
had the unique boon of dying at will, he preferred to lie down on ç
the bed of arrows and postpone his demise till the beginning of Uttar<193>ya<207>a ç
or the northern solstice.
@SPACE1 = 
Dro<207>aparva, the seventh, apart from describing the heroic exploits ç
of Dro<207>a, the preceptor, culminating in his deaththrough stratagem, ç
also contains an account of thebrilliant achievements of the boy-hero ç
Abhimanyu on the battlefield and his tragic death.
The eighth book, Kar<207>aparva, details the gory death of the evil ç
genius Du··<193>sana, the second of the Kaurava brothers, at the hands ç
of the colossal Bh<200>ma, and the fall of Kar<207>a himself at the ç
hands of Arjuna after a bitter fight.
<185>alyaparva, the ninth book, describes the final encounter between ç
Bh<200>ma and Duryodhana on the last day of the war, the latter succumbing ç
to the mortal blow received during the duel.
Sauptikaparva, the tenth, delineates the gruesome massacre of the ç
P<193><207><195>ava army and its allies, in the night during sleep, ç
by A·vatth<193>man, Dro<207>a's vengeful son.
The next book, Str<200>parva, describes graphically the pitiful ç
lamentations of the women and the widows of the dead warriors.
Then come the twelfth and the thirteenth books, the <185><193>ntiparva ç
and the °nu·<193>sanikaparva, containing wonderful discourses on ç
all aspects of dharma bythe patriarch Bh<200><218>ma at the request ç
of Yudhi-<218><219>hira. Bh<200><218>ma's demise and Yudhi<218><219>hira's ç
coronation are the other incidents dealt with. The two well-known ç
hymns, Vi<218><207>u-sahasran<193>ma and <185>ivasahasran<193>ma, ç
as also the Anug<200>t<193> (asubsidiary discourse by <185>r<200> ç
K<216><218><207>a to Arjuna) are parts of these books.
@SPACE1 = 
°·vamedhikaparva, thefourteenth, describes the departure of <185>r<200> ç
K<216><218><207>a for Dv<193>rak<193> and the horse-sacrifice (A·va-medha) ç
performed by Yudhi<218><219>hira. The humiliation of Yudhi<218><219>hira ç
by a talking weasel that describes the supreme sacrifice of a br<193>hma<207>a ç
family is an interesting sidelight of this book.
The next book, °·ramav<193>sikaparva, describes the departure of ç
the old Dh<216>ta-r<193><218><219>ra to the forest along with G<193>ndh<193>r<200>, ç
his spouse, and Kunt<200> and their subsequent death in a forest fire.
The sixteenth book, Mausalaparva, gives an account of the mutual ç
destruction of the Y<193>dava heroes as also the death of <185>r<200> ç
K<216><218><207>a at the hands of a hunter. The Mah<193>prasth<193>nika ç
and the Svarg<193>- roha<207>a Parvas, the last two books, give ç
an account of the final journey of the P<193><207><195>avas, their ç
death on the way, with Yudhi<218><219>hira alone reaching heaven.
@SB = Characters
The Mah<193>bh<193>rata presents us with a veritable array of human ç
characters, from the sublime to the ridiculous. No type of human emotion, ç
no deed of valour, generosity, sacrifice or meanness is missed here. ç
Nor is there any artificiality in these portrayals. A brief delineation ç
of some of the more important characters may now be attempted here.
<185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a is undoubtedly the most brilliant and ç
picturesque personality projected by the epic. He appears on the scene ç
rather suddenly at the time of Draupad<200>'s svaya<221>vara (formal ç
selection of husband by a maiden princess), and continues to saunter ç
the scenes right up to the end. All his energies are channelized only ç
in one direction: protection of the right and the good, and punishment ç
or destruction of the wicked. His remarkable prowess, matched only ç
by the bewitching beauty of his perfect form, sage counsels, superb ç
stratagems and immensely superior statesmanship, captivate our heart. ç
There is absolutely no doubt that the epic projects him as God Himself ç
come down to save mankind, as he himself admits in the Bhagavadg<200>t<193>.
Bh<200><218>ma,  the  grand  old  man,  is another towering personality ç
that awes and inspires us, whether in the supreme sacrifice of abdicating ç
his right to the throne or the vow of celibacy or the matchless heroism ç
on the battlefield. It is but meet that <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a, ç
who recognized his encyclopaedic knowledge and wisdom, has got it ç
preserved for the posterity by prodding him through Yudhi<218><219>hira ç
to unfold it. The <185><193>nti and the °nu·<193>sanika Parvas ç
are practically the repositories of his teachings.
Yudhi<218><219>hira, the eldest of the P<193><207><195>avas, is perhaps ç
the most dominant character of the epic, next only to <185>r<200> ç
K<216><218><207>a. He was not only a great hero on the battlefield, ç
true to his name (yudhi<|>=<|>in battle, sthira<|>=<|>one who is steady), ç
but a veritable incarnation of dharma or righteousness, a rare combination ç
indeed. That is why he is often addressed as Dharmar<193>ja (`the ç
monarch of righteousness') too. Come what may, he would never swerve ç
from the path of ethical uprightness about which his thinking was ç
always crystal clear. The Yak<218>apra·na-episode is replete with ç
the gems of his wisdom.
The epic pictures Bh<200>ma, the colossus and Arjuna, the warrior, ç
in more human terms.Ifdown-to-earthcommon sense characterizes Bh<200>ma, ç
Arjuna is more idea-listic and dreamy. However, both were extraordinarily ç
devoted to <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a and implicitly obedient to ç
Yudhi<218><219>hira.
@SPACE1 = 
Dro<207>a, the preceptor-warrior who was forced to take to the military ç
profession in spite of being a br<193>hma<207>a, appears a shade darker ç
than Bh<200><218>ma. Notwithstanding his learning and austerity, he ç
exhibited a streak of vengeful nature.
Vidura, the son of the maid-servant, is another personality who strikes ç
us not only by his sagacity but also by his intense devotion to <185>r<200> ç
K<216><218><207>a about whose divinity he had absolutely no doubt. ç
Here is a living example to show that it is not birth or caste that ç
makes for greatness but intrinsic character. His discourse to Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra ç
in the Udyogaparva is now well-known as Viduran<200>ti.
Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas, is the chief villain of the ç
epic. His greed and jealousy overshadowed whatever heroism or virtues ç
he had, resulting in the near-total destruction of the two races and ç
untold misery to millions.
If the word `tragedy' needs any illustration, one should turn to Kar<207>a. ç
A victim of circumstances, his story can never be read with the eyes ç
dry or the heart unmoved. He was supremely noble and generous in every ç
inch of his personality. He is perhaps the last word for friendship, ç
loyalty and generosity.
Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra, the blind and vacillating king, was blind ç
not only physically but also in wisdom. His inordinate infatuation ç
for his children, the Kauravas, prevented him from exercising his ç
authority to uphold dharma.
@SPACE1 = 
Among the women characters it is Draupad<200>, the P<193><210>c<193>la ç
princess and the queen of the P<193><207><195>avas, that strikes us ç
most. Endowed with striking beauty, a sharp intellect and a sharper ç
tongue which she could wield effectively, she remained absolutely ç
faithful to her husbands. By her supreme sacrifices she has set an ç
example of wifely virtues.
Kunt<200>, the mother of the P<193><207><195>avas, impresses us as ç
a helpless but noble princess. The fortitude with which she silently ç
bore all her misfortunes and miseries is unparalleled.
G<193>ndh<193>r<200>, who made the utmost sacrifice of denying herself ç
the pleasures of eyesight because Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra, her ç
husband, was born blind, is a paragon of the ideal of wifehood. Unlike ç
her husband, she was bold enough to admonish her son Duryodhana for ç
his wicked behaviour and warn him of its dire consequences, because ç
she was ever devoted to dharma.
@SB = Veritable Encyclopaedia of Dharma
@SPACE1 = 
The Mah<193>bh<193>rata, also known as the Pa<210>cama Veda (`the ç
fifth Veda'), is a veritable encyclopaedia of Hindu religion and culture. ç
The claim of the S<220>ta Ugra·ravas that `anything anywhere is an ç
echo of what is here' and `what is not here is nowhere' is no exaggeration. ç
Every aspect of dharma†whether it is r<193>ja-dharma (statecraft), ç
<193>pad-dharma (conduct permissible during dire calamities), d<193>na-dharma ç
(liberality) or mok<218>a-dharma (conduct pertaining to emancipation)†finds ç
its due place here. In fact, the very purpose of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata ç
is to expound dharma in all its ramifications. The celebrated Bhagavadg<200>t<193>, ç
the less known Anug<200>t<193>, as also the two well-known hymns ç
Vi<218><207>u- sahasran<193>ma and <185>ivasahasran<193>ma, have ç
been sources of inspiration to philosophers and votaries of religious ç
pursuits over the millennia. The cult of Vi<218><207>u and the reconciliation ç
of the various warring faiths also find an appropriate place. Along ç
with the growth of rigidity of the caste system, honest attempts at ç
extolling human excellence and treating it as the real basis of br<193>hma<207>ahood ç
are also conspicuous. In spite of the misogynists of the age, women ç
did find a place of honour during the epic period.
@SB = Mah<193>bh<193>rata Outside India 
There is enough evidence to admit that the Mah<193>bh<193>rata had ç
migrated outside India too, especially to the South-East Asian countries. ç
Incidents from this epic have been portrayed in stone relief in theAngkor ç
Wat and Angkor Thom of Kampuchia.
@SB = Epilogue
Whether the Mah<193>bh<193>rata was the composition of a single ç
poet or the compilation of several editors, whether the great war ç
was fought in 3100 <MS>B.C.<D> or 1400 <MS>B.C.<D> or 950 <MS>B.C.<D>, ç
whether it was a family feud or a ferocious war, it is verily the ç
biggest classic ever composed by man and will retain its relevance ç
as long as the sun and the moon shine or the stars twinkle, because ç
it mirrors the eternal drama of human existence.
@NT = Mah<193>bh<193><218>ya
@N1 = (`the Great Commentary')
The A<218><219><193>dhy<193>y<200> of P<193><207>ini (5th century ç
<MS>B.<|>C.<D>) has been considered as a unique and unparallelled work ç
of Sanskrit grammar† or for that matter, any grammar of any language†by  well-known  scholars  of ç
Sanskrit as also Indology.
As the very name indicates, it is a work in a<218><219>a or eight, ç
adhy<193>yas or chapters. It has 3996 s<220>tras or aphorisms in all.
The Mah<193>bh<193><218>ya is a commentary on the A<218><219><193>dhy<193>y<200>, ç
by Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>). It covers only 1228 s<220>tras. ç
It is written in a simple conversational style. It throws much light ç
on contemporary life and culture.
Whether this Pata<210>jali is the same as the author of P<193>ta<210>jala ç
Yogas<220>tras hasbeen hotly debated. However, Hindu tradition considers ç
the two to be identical.
@NT = mah<193>bh<193>va
@N1 = (`the great emotion')
This is a technical term especially used by the Bengal school of Vai<218><207>avism ç
nourished by <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a Caitanya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1485-1533) and his disciples as also his followers.
An ordinary bh<193>va or emotion, is the joy derived from enjoying ç
the worldly objects. When the object is God Himself and the intensity ç
of joy reaches such a height that the devotee feels himself as one ç
with God, it is termed `mah<193>bh<193>va'. The gopis of V<216>nd<193>vana ç
are normally given as the ideal example for this state. <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a ç
Caitanya also is believed to have experienced this state quite often.

@N1 = (`the great sprinkling<R>ç
[during the coronation of a king]')
The    Aitareya   Br<193>hma<207>a   (38) describes the coronation ç
of Indra as the king of the gods in heaven. This rite has been called ç
`Aindr<200> Mah<193>bhi<218>eka'.
Probably following this, the coronation of a great king, which includes ç
the sprinkling of water from various sacred sources (= abhi<218>eka), ç
came to be known as `mah<193>bhi<218>eka'.
Here are the names of some of the great kings who underwent the Mah<193>bhi<218>eka ç
ceremony: Janamejaya, Tura K<193>va<218>eya, Cyavana Bh<193>rgava, ç
Ambar<200><218>a, and Bharata (son of Du<218>yanta).

D<193>na or giving gifts has been extolled greatly in the Hindu scriptures, ç
especially in the dharma·<193>stras and the pur<193><207>as. That ç
this is an important aspect of dharma (righteous living) in this Kaliyuga ç
or Iron Age, has also been stressed much.
Out of the several d<193>nas mentioned there, `mah<193>d<193>na' or ç
`a great gift' is also one. The mah<193>d<193>nas may be ten (vide ç
Agnipur<193><207>a 209.23,<|>24) or sixteen (vide Matsyapur<193><207>a ç
274 to 289). Some of them are: tul<193>puru<218>a (weighing a person ç
against gold or silver, and distributing it to worthy persons), gosahasra ç
(a thousand milch-cows), horses, elephants, chariots, land, house, ç
bride and servant-maids.
An elaborate and complicated procedure has been set out for making ç
these gifts.

Mah<193>deva is one of the several names and aspects of <185>iva. ç
He is included among the eight forms (`m<220>rtya<218><219>aka') of ç
<185>iva or the eleven forms of Rudra (`ek<193>da·arudra'). He may ç
be blue or white in complexion. He is shown seated on a lotus seat ç
with four arms, two holding <219>a<209>ka (hammer) and k<216><218><207>am<216>ga ç

S<193>kamedha, the last, is spread over two days. Mah<193>havis or ç
the great offering is an important ritual in this sacrifice. Eight ç
oblations are offered to eight deities like Indra, Agni, Mahendra ç
and Vi·va- karman. Of these eight, five are common to the other two ç
