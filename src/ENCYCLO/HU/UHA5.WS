@NID = B<216>hannal<193> (Arjuna in the disguise of aeunuch during ç
the aj<210><193>tav<193>sa, living incognito in the palace of Vir<193><219>a). ç
She was later married to Abhimanyu the son of Subhadr<193> and Arjuna.
When Abhimanyu was killed in the Kuruk<218>etra war she was pregnant, ç
carrying the future king Par<200>k<218>it. Though Par<200>k<218>it ç
was killed by A·vatth<193>ma, K<216><218><207>a by his divine powers ç
revived him.
@NT = Uttarag<200>t<193>
This is one of the minor G<200>t<193>s composed in imitation of the ç
well-known Bhagavadg<200>t<193>. Though sometimes mentioned in the ç
colophons of the manuscripts as forming a part of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata ç
or the Bh<193>gavata, it is not found in the extant  texts  of  these  works.  In  all ç
probability it is an independent work.
It is in the form of a dialogue between Arjuna and K<216><218><207>a.
As per most of the manuscripts, it has three adhy<193>yas (chapters) ç
containing 122 verses in all.
Only one version contains 241 verses spread over six chapters.
There  is  only  one  commentary ascribed to Gau<195>ap<193>da (circa ç
<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 700). It is quite useful in understanding the text.
A brief summary of the work may now be given here:
@S10N = First Adhy<193>ya (57 verses)
Arjuna asks a question about Brahman, the knowledge of which gives ç
immediate liberation.
K<216><218><207>a replies that Brahman which is represented by O<221> ç
in the scriptures is immutable and indestructible. Attaining to it, ç
the knower is released from all bondages. Practice of pr<193><207><193>y<193>ma ç
and meditating on Brahman helps in this attainment.
Incidentally, Lord K<216><218><207>a says that dharma and adharma, ç
the mind, the five senses, and the five elements accompany the j<200>va ç
even after the death of one body, as long as he has not attained the ç
highest knowledge.
Control of the senses as a necessary means of spiritual wisdom is ç
greatly stressed.
@S10N = Second Adhy<193>ya (48 verses)
When one realises the omniscient, omnipresent Brahman, what is the ç
means by which one can actually know ``I am Brahman?'' This is the ç
question of Arjuna. K<216><218><207>a says that it is a direct experience ç
like water becoming one with water or milk becoming one with milk.
This is followed by a detailed description of the several n<193><195><200>s ç
in the body (See<MS>N°£®<D>.)
@S10N = Third Adhy<193>ya (17 verses)
This sums up the discussion and declares that the reality alone is ç
to be sought from amongst all the different sciences. Life is too ç
short to master the various sciences. Yogins devoted to <193>tmaj<210><193>na ç
(Self-knowledge) do not bother to visit the various places of pilgrimage.
The work stresses that steady devotion to Ke·ava gives liberation ç
to the yogin, especially if he is free from cravings.
@NT = Uttarak<193><207><195>a
This is the last book of the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a of V<193>lm<200>ki.
See <MS>R°M°YAØA<D> for details.
@NT = Uttarakum<193>ra
He was the son of the king Vir<193><219>a of  Matsyade·a.  When  the  Kauravas ç
invaded Vir<193><219>a's capital and were taking away the royal cows, ç
Uttara boasted thathe would drive them away. Taking B<216>hannal<193> ç
(Arjuna disguised as a eunach) as his charioteer, he went to the battlefield. ç
However when he saw the huge army of the enemies he was unnerved and ç
wanted to run away. Arjuna succeeded in filling him with courage and ç
with him as his charioteer drove away all the Kauravas.
He participated in the Kuruk<218>etra war for the P<193><207><195>avas ç
and was killed by <185>alya, the king of Madrade·a.
@NT = Uttaram<200>m<193><221>s<193>
As opposed to the M<200>m<193><221>s<193> Dar·ana of Jaimini, which ç
is termed the P<220>rva-m<200>m<193><221>s<193>, the Ved<193>nta Dar·ana ç
of B<193>da-r<193>ya<207>a is known as the Uttara-m<200>m<193><221>s<193>.
@NT = uttaravedi
It means the upper or high altar. It is erected in the east, situated ç
within the sacrificial area, but outside the y<193>ga·<193>l<193> ç
(shed). It is a square mound. The actual measurements differ. It is ç
used in some Soma sacrifices.
@NT = uttar<193>ya<207>a
@N1 = (`the northern path')
See <MS>DEVAY°NA<D>.
@NT = Utth<193>nadv<193>da·<200>
One of the most well-known festivals that falls on a dv<193>da·<200> ç
is the Utth<193>na-dv<193>da·<200>   (K<193>rtt<200>ka   ·ukla   dv<193>da·<200>† ç
generally in November). On this day Lord Vi<218><207>u who had gone ç
to sleep on the <185>ayan<200> day (°<218><193><195>ha ·ukla ek<193>da·<200>), ç
gets up. Hence itis called `Utth<193>nadv<193>da·<200>' (utth<193>na ç
= getting up).
It is again on this day that Tulas<200> or V<216>nd<193> was married ç
to Hari or Vi<218><207>u. So, it is also called Tulas<200>viv<193>ha ç
day. Ceremonial marriage of the Tulas<200> plant (holy basil) with ç
Lord Hari is performed on this day. In some houses images of Hari ç
and Tulas<200> are kept for three days(from the navam<200> to ek<193>da·<200>) ç
and worshipped. They are married on the dv<193>da·<200> day.
@NT = Uva<219>a
The language of the Vedas is quite terse and archaic. Hence it is ç
rather difficult to understand them without the help of standard commentaries.
Among the well-known commentators of the Vedas who have made them ç
easy to understand, Uva<219>a is also one. He was probably a br<193>hma<207>a ç
from Kashmir. His father was Vajra<219>a and he lived in the city ç
of Avant<200> during the reign of the king Bhoja. He probably lived ç
in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1042.
He has written a commentary on the <185>ukla Yajurveda Sa<221>hit<193>†also ç
known as V<193>jasaney<200> Sa<221>hit<193>†called Mantra-bh<193><218>ya. ç
The commentary is simple and clear, but follows the method of interpreting ç
according to Vedic sacrificial termino-logy rather than philosophical ç
concepts.
His other works are bh<193><218>yas or commentaries  on  the  <184>kpr<193>ti·<193>khya, ç
Yaju<199>pr<193>ti·<193>khya and <184>ksarv<193>nukrama<207><200>.
