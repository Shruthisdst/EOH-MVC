The depth as well as the catholicity of their thought has attracted ç
the attention of the savants of other religions and societies also, ç
resulting in their being translated into other languages too.
An earnest study of the Upani<218>ads, without preconceived notions ç
and prejudices, is bound to inspire one to aspire for the life of ç
the spirit.

@NT = Upapur<193><207>as
Ancient legends preserved in the collective memory of the Hindus gradually ç
took the shape of the Mah<193>pur<193><207>as. Tradition enumerates ç
them as eighteen and ascribes their authorship to the sage Vedavy<193>sa.
Along with these Mah<193>pur<193><207>as, there gradually grew up ç
another mass of literature, similar to them. These works came to be ç
known as upapur<193><207>as. Though assigned to Vedavy<193>sa as the ç
author, they are obviously the works of different sages composed over ç
a few centuries.
The lists of the eighteen upapur<193><207>as given in different pur<193><207>as ç
vary considerably.
A few of these upapur<193><207>as may now be described briefly:
@S10 = °di Upapur<193><207>a
The printed version as available now is assigned to the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
600. This contains the story of K<216><218><207>a in detail.
@S10 = Bhavi<218>yottara Upapur<193><207>a
Apart from some interesting stories, it gives descriptions of the ç
code of conduct according to dharma, to be followed by all.
@S10 = Brahmottara Upapur<193><207>a
It appears to be an appendix of the Brahmapur<193><207>a. Comprising ç
3000 verses it describes the greatness of the river known as Balaj<193> ç
in the country of M<193>rv<193>r.
@S10 = B<216>had-dharma Upapur<193><207>a
This is a fairly big work. According to it, the whole creation depends ç
upon <185>iva and <185>akti. Stories of Dharmavy<193>dha, <185>r<200> ç
R<193>ma, descent of the Ga<209>g<193> river, lives of great sages ç
like Vy<193>sa and V<193>lm<200>ki, of avat<193>ras of Vi<218><207>u, ç
var<207><193>·rama-dharmas, greatness of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
one's duties towards parents and other elders, the need for a good ç
and efficient king to rule over a country and a host of other topics ç
have been dealt with here.
@S10 = Dev<200>bh<193>gavata Upapur<193><207>a
This is a voluminous work, containing the story of Mahi<218><193>sura ç
being killed by the Dev<200>. A lot of material connected with rituals ç
and worship is also included.
@S10 = K<193>lik<193> Upapur<193><207>a
This is a work devoted to the <185><193>kta cult. It describes the ç
various aspects of P<193>rvat<200> such as Girij<193>, Dev<200>, Bhadrak<193>l<200> ç
and K<193>l<200>. A description of the temple of K<193>m<193>khy<193> ç
in Assam, story of Dak<218>a's sacrifice, worship of the Dev<200> ç
and some t<193>ntrik rites are a part of this work.
@S10 = Kalki Upapur<193><207>a
This is considered as an appendix of Bh<193>gavata. Probably composed ç
during <MS>A.D.<D> 1800, it gives the story of Kalki, as the tenth ç
avat<193>ra of Vi<218><207>u, to appear in future.
@S10 = N<193>rad<200>ya Upapur<193><207>a
This work concentrates mainly on the story of Rukm<193><209>gada, ç
a great devotee of Vi<218><207>u.
@S10 = Narasi<221>ha Upapur<193><207>a
This is a comparatively ancient work assigned to the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
400. Lomahar<218>a<207>a, a disciple of Vedavy<193>sa, taught this ç
to the sages like Bh<193>radv<193>ja at Pray<193>ga.
The following are the topics dealt with in this work: hymns to Lord ç
Narasi<221>ha; creation of the world according to the S<193><209>khya ç
system; origin of some Manus and <216><218>is; meditations on Brahm<193> ç
and Vi<218><207>u; greatness of the a<218><219><193>k<218>ar<200> ç
mantra (eight-lettered mantra of N<193>r<193>ya<207>a); 108 names ç
of °ditya (Sun-god); duties  towards  elders  and  superiors; construction ç
details of the temple of Narasi<221>ha; evils of Kaliyuga; places ç
of pilgrimage dedicated to Vi<218><207>u.
@S10 = Puru<218>ottama Upapur<193><207>a
This upapur<193><207>a, still in the manuscript from, is devoted entirely ç
to the glorification of the pilgrim centre Pur<200> (or Jagann<193>tha ç
Pur<200>) including the details of the worship of the deities there.
@S10 = S<193>mba Upapur<193><207>a
This is one of the few upapur<193><207>as that has been printed. It ç
probably belongs to the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 500-800.
The principal hero of this work is S<193>mba, the eldest son of <185>r<200> ç
K<216><218><207>a. He is pictured as a votary of S<220>rya (the Sun-god) ç
and a propagator of the S<220>rya-cult. He was responsible for bringing ç
the Maga br<193>hma<207>as, worshippers of S<220>rya, and settled ç
them in a colony.
@EMERGENCY = The subjects dealt with in this upapur<193><207>a are ç
as follows: establishing theimage of S<220>rya and S<220>rya temples; ç
geographical details of the earth; yoga; the three Vedas; sa<221>ny<193>sa; ç
characteristics of a devotee of S<220>rya; observance of vratas like ç
Rathasaptam<200>; some ·<193>nti rites; a few hymns on S<220>rya.
@S10 = Saura Upapur<193><207>a
@EMERGENCY = This is an appendix of the Brahma-pur<193><207>a. It ç
teaches that <185>iva and S<220>rya are identical. Li<209>gap<220>j<193> ç
(worship of the <185>ivali<209>ga) is described in detail.
@S10 = <185>iva Upapur<193><207>a
This is a fairly big work. The greatness of <185>iva is the main theme. ç
Worship of <185>iva through the <185>ivali<209>ga is described in ç
detail. Other topics are: <185>ivasahasra-n<193>ma; importance of ç
fasting and festivals; a few t<193>ntrik practices.
@S10 = Vi<218><207>udharma Upapur<193><207>a
This work contains 4000 verses spread over 105 chapters. It was probably ç
composed during the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 200-300.
Some of the topics dealt with are: stories of Ambar<200><218>a and ç
Prahl<193>da; various kinds of Vai<218><207>ava vratas; descriptions ç
of some hells; eulogy of d<193>na (giving gifts); greatness of a true ç
br<193>hma<207>a and a true k<218>attriya hero; devotion to Vi<218><207>u; ç
power of Sudar·ana discus; temples and images; some beautiful stotras ç
or hymns; sins and means of offsetting their effects.
The Agnipur<193><207>a seems to have drawn upon this Upapur<193><207>a ç
for some of its topics.
@S10 = Vi<218><207>udharmottara Upapur<193><207>a
This is a fairly large work, almost encyclopaedic in character. It ç
might have been composed during the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 400 to 500.
The following are some of the topics dealt with in this work: astronomy; ç
creation; astrology; ·akuna·<193>stra or science of prognostication; ç
karma and its consequences; ·r<193>ddha (obsequial rites); d<193>na ç
(giving gifts); r<193>jan<200>ti (political science); science of war; ç
<193>yurveda; science of music; election of a king and his coronation; ç
duties of a king; a few magical sciences.
There is reason to believe that theMatsyapur<193><207>a has borrowed ç
some chapters from this upapur<193><207>a.
Apart from these, many more upapur<193><207>as have been discovered ç
and also quoted in some nibandha works. Some of them are: Ek<193>mrapur<193><207>a, ç
Yugapur<193><207>a, Ga<207>e·apur<193><207>a, and Ca<207><195>ik<193>pur<193><207>a.
There is no doubt that these upa-pur<193><207>as also have considerably ç
enriched popular Hinduism.
@NT = uparati
@N1 = (`cessation')
Advaita Ved<193>nta prescribes a fourfold spiritual discipline, called ç
s<193>dhanacatu<218><219>aya, as a preliminary step. <185>am<193>di-<218>a<219>ka ç
forms the third step of this discipline.
<185>am<193>di<218>a<219>ka comprises a group of six exercises viz., ç
·ama (tranquillity), dama (control of external sense-organs), uparati ç
(cessation), titik<218><193> (forbearance), ·raddh<193> (faith) and ç
sam<193>dh<193>na (concentration).
Uparati is the cessation of the sense-organs, after they are restrained, ç
from the pursuit of sense-objects.
@NT = up<193>sana
@N1 = (`sitting near,' `meditation')
@EMERGENCY = In general, the word up<193>sana means meditation.
However, in the P<193><210>car<193>tra °gamas, it has been used ç
in a technical sense associated with ritualistic worship. It has five ç
aspects: abhigamana (keeping the temple clean); up<193>d<193>na (collecting ç
the materials needed for worship); ijy<193> (ritualistic worship); ç
sv<193>dhy<193>ya (repetition of God's name and chanting of hymns); ç
yoga (meditation on God).
@NT = up<193>san<193>k<193><207><195>a
@EMERGENCY = See <MS>J<178>°NAK°Ø£A<D>.
@NT = upasa<209>graha<207>a
@EMERGENCY = See <MS>ABHIV°DANA<D>.
@NT = upa·ruti
@N1 = (`oracular voices')
@EMERGENCY = Upa·ruti is a curious mode of divining the future, described ç
in some works on prognostication.
@EMERGENCY = One of the methods prescribes that three married woman ç
along with a maiden, should worship an image of Ga<207>e·a as per ç
the rules given in such works, keep it in front of the house of a ç
washerman or an outcaste in the early morning and listen attentively ç
to the conversations in the house uttered freely. A proper analysis ç
of this can lead to the solution of the problem on hand.
@NT = upastara<207>a
@N1 = (`act of spreading')
@EMERGENCY = In some Vedic sacrifices, rice-cakes called puro<195><193>·a ç
are used for offering into the consecrated fire. °jya or ghee is spread ç
below these puro<195><193>·a cakes before they are cut. This act of ç
spreading is called upastara<207>a.
In Somay<193>gas, a little soma juice is put into the camasas (cups) ç
before filling them. This too is called upastara<207>a.
@NT = upasth<193>na
@N1 = (`worship or homage')
An <193>hit<193>gni (one who has ceremonially established the Vedic ç
fires) is expected to perform Agnihotra (See <MS>AGNIHOTRA<D> for ç
details.) both in the morning and in the evening. After the evening ç
offering he is expected to pay homage to the fire by reciting the ç
V<193>tsapra mantras (vide <184>gveda 10.45; V<193>jasaney<200> ç
Sa<221>hit<193> 3.11.36; <185>atapatha Br<193>hma<207>a 2.3.4.9-41). ç
This is called upasth<193>na.
Whether this upasth<193>na should be done only in the evening or both ç
in the morning and in the evening, opinion seems to be divided.
@NT = Upavar<218>a
The principal schools of Ved<193>nta arebased on their interpretation ç
of theBrahmas<220>tras of B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a. The pioneering ç
<193>c<193>ryas (teachers) of these schools often try to garner support ç
for their philosophy from the earlier, more ancient, teachers, who ç
might have commented upon it. One such, quoted by R<193>m<193>nuja ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1017-1137) is the V<216>tti-k<193>ra Bodh<193>yana. ç
<185>a<209>kara (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 788-820) refers to one Upavar<218>a. ç
According to Ved<193>nta De·ika (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1268-1370) both are ç
the same person.
Upavar<218>a had two more names, K<216>tako<219>i and Halabh<220>ti.
Nothing is known about him.
According to some scholars he wrote a commentary on the P<220>rvam<200>m<193><221>s<193> ç
S<220>tras and existed during the period 100 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> and <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
100.
@NT = upav<193>sa
@N1 = (`fasting')
@EMERGENCY = Upav<193>sa or fasting as a spiritual discipline or as ç
a part of religious rites or even as an expiation for sins is found ç
in all the major religions of the world. Hinduism has plenty of it.
@EMERGENCY = Fasting undertaken voluntarily and willingly helps to ç
discipline both the body and the mind. Along with fasting, worship ç
of one's deity, repetition of the divine name, observance of mauna ç
or silence, keeping vigil in the night as also chanting of hymns and ç
devotional singing are to be undertaken.
@EMERGENCY = Generally fasting means avoiding cooked food. Uncooked ç
food like fruits andmilk is permitted. However, total abstinence ç
from all kinds of food is also recommended to those who are strong ç
enough to withstand it.
If fasting is to be undertaken as a part of pr<193>ya·citta or expiation, ç
it can be of three kinds: ekabhakta (eating only once in the day); ç
nakta (eating only once, at night); and, ay<193>cita (taking the food ç
that is brought unasked).
@EMERGENCY = Old and weak persons, patients and little children are ç
not expected to fast.
@NT = upavasatha
@N1 = (`to dwell near,' `to fast')
A Vedic sacrificer is expected to fast and keep vigil before beginning ç
the main rite. This fasting as also the day of fasting is known as ç
upavasatha. On this day, preliminary matters like preparation of an ç
altar, fetching of the y<220>pa (sacrificial post) etc., are attended ç
to.
@NT = Upaveda
@N1 = (`subsidiary Veda')
The word `veda' means knowledge, a particular science.
Certain subsidiary fields of know-ledge which also go by the title ç
`Veda' are considered very important for the develop-ment of the human ç
society. The are: °yurveda (science of life or health); Dhanurveda ç
(science of war); G<193>ndharva-veda  (science  of  music);  <185>astra·<193>stra ç
(science of weapons).
These four are said to be associated respectively with the four well-known ç
Vedas, viz., <184>gveda, Yajurveda, S<193>maveda and Atharvaveda.
@NT = upav<200>ta
Every dvija (`the twice-born,' a member of the first three var<207>as ç
or castes) is expected to undergo the sacrament of upanayana and wear ç
the yaj<210>opav<200>ta (sacred thread) on his body always. The normal ç
and permanent way of wearing it is to put it on the left shoulder ç
and allow it to hang below the right armpit. This mode of wearing ç
is called upav<200>ta.
For other modes see <MS>NIV®TA<D>.
@NT = up<193>ya
@N1 = (`means or method')
This is a general term with several shades of meaning. It can mean ç
any method by which we can attain what we want.
According to one version, it can be classified as laukika (secular) ç
and alaukika (non-secular or spiritual). The wheel and the stick used ç
in preparing a mud-pot are laukika-up<193>yas. Performing a sacrifice ç
like the Jyoti<218><219>oma to attain heaven is alaukika-up<193>ya.
A king has to use one of the four prescribed up<193>yas in subduing ç
or getting rid of his enemies. They are: s<193>ma (negotiation by ç
peaceful means); d<193>na (a policy  of  give  and  take);  bheda ç
(manoeuvring a split in the enemy ranks); da<207><195>a (warfare, ç
fighting).
A creditor can get back his money from the debtor by using any of ç
the following up<193>yas: dharma (by negotiation through mutual friends ç
and well-wishers); vyavah<193>ra (by helping the debtor to establish ç
himself in a profitable job and get back his money when he prospers); ç
bal<193>tk<193>ra (by forcibly taking away the debtor's property).
In certain schools of <185>aivism, five up<193>yas are recommended ç
for spiritual progress. They are: v<193>sacary<193> (leading a pure ç
life); japa (repetition of divine name); dhy<193>na   (meditation);   rudrasmara<207>a ç
(remembering  Lord  Rudra  or  <185>iva); prapatti (surrender to God).
@NT = <220>rdhvapu<207><195>ra
@N1 = (`upright or vertical<R>ç
religious mark')
Literally the word means a religious mark (pu<207><195>ra) which is ç
worn upright (<220>rdhva). In common parlance, it is called n<193>ma. ç
Since it has been ordained by the Vai<218><207>ava scriptures that ç
while marking the various parts of the body with the <220>rdhvapu<207><195>ra, ç
names of Lord Vi<218><207>u (like Ke·ava) are to be repeated and that ç
the respective mark represents the respective aspect of the Deity ç
indicated by that particular name, the word n<193>ma (= name) has ç
become synonymous with the <220>rdhvapu<207><195>ra itself. Invariably ç
associated with the ·a<209>kha or the conch on its left side and the ç
cakra or the discus on its right side, this forms the chief symbol ç
of the followers of <185>r<200> R<193>m<193>nuja (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1017-1137) ç
who are known as <185>r<200>vai<218><207>avas.
Lord Vi<218><207>u, the middle deity of the Hindu Trinity, does not ç
seem to have had a very prominent place in the Vedas. But, by the ç
time the Bh<193>gavata cult developed (through its basic writings ç
like the N<193>r<193>ya<207><200>ya section of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a and the P<193>ncar<193>tra °gamas ç
as also the famous Bh<193>gavatam) Vi<218><207>u or N<193>r<193>ya<207>a ç
had become the most important deity of the Hindu pantheon.
The word Vi<218><207>u literally means one who pervades everything, ç
one who has entered into everything. So, Vi<218><207>u is the Cosmic ç
Spirit, the Absolute, which pervades everything. For purposes of religious ç
worship and meditation, he is described as endowed with a beautiful ç
form, deep blue in colour. He has four arms wearing ·a<209>kha (conch), ç
cakra (discus), gad<193> (mace) and padma (lotus). He wears a jewel, ç
Kaustubha, on His chest. Single-minded devotion is the easiest and ç
best means to please Him.
@SPACE1 = 
The followers of Vi<218><207>uism can be broadly divided into two ç
groups: the Sadvai<218><207>avas  (or  Vai<218><207>avas  who  are ç
followers of <185>r<200> Madhv<193>c<193>rya) and the <185>r<200>vai<218><207>avas. ç
Both of them accept Lord Vi<218><207>u as the Supreme Deity and devotion ç
to Him as the chief means of attaining spiritual beatitude. <185>a<209>kha ç
and cakra as the religious symbols are acceptable to both of them. ç
However, the <185>r<200>vai<218><207>avas add the <188>rdhvapu<207><195>ra ç
also.
The ·a<209>kha or the conch has the form of a multiple spiral evolving ç
from one point into ever-increasing spheres. It thus symbolised the ç
origin of the universe from a single source, viz., God. Being found ç
in water, it symbolises the causal waters from which the universe ç
was evolved and into which it gets dissolved. When blown, it produces ç
a sound, which represents the primeval sound from which creation developed. ç
It is also taken to be the representation of the Cosmic Ego. Its involute ç
curve can represent, on the plane of the microcosm or the individual, ç
the egoism which involves him in sa<221>s<193>ra or transmigratory ç
existence.
The cakra or the discus represents the Universal Mind, the unlimited ç
power that creates and destroys all the spheres and forms of the universe, ç
the nature of which is to revolve or to change. It also represents ç
the Lord's will to multiply. Its six spokes represent the six seasons ç
of the year, hence the changing universe, set on the unchanging axle, ç
the pivot, represented by the magic syllable hr<200>m of the Lord. ç
The circle round the wheel is m<193>y<193>, the divine power of illusion. ç
On the microcosmic plane, it can be taken to be a true representation ç
of the individual's mind, which is ever changing like the rotating ç
wheel.
@SPACE1 = 
The Hindu religious tradition has always insisted upon its followers ç
to wear religious marks appropriate to their faith, on their bodies, ç
especially on the forehead. <188>rdhvapu<207><195>ra is one such mark. ç
The meaning and significance of this symbol is rather obscure to discover. ç
When marked on the forehead of the Deity in a temple, it may signify ç
the power of that Deity to uplift the votaries. When marked on the ç
forehead of the votary it may remind him of the need to take a spiritually ç
upward path. It is sometimes interpreted that the two lines on the ç
outside represent the i<195><193> and the pi<209>gal<193> (the two ç
passages for the flow of pr<193><207>ic energy, intertwining the backbone) ç
and the middle line (marked in red or yellow colour) represents the ç
Su<218>umn<193> passage (through which the ku<207><195>alin<200> power ç
flows after awakening). The three together represent the yogic path ç
of spiritual ascent.
So, the total symbol (the <188>rdhva-pu<207><195>ra along with the ç
·a<209>kha and the cakra) may mean that one who aspires after controlling ç
the mind and subjugating the egoism should take to the propitiation ç
of the Deity's merciful power or to the Yogic path.
The <188>rdhvapu<207><195>ra is marked as <|> by the Va<195>agalais ç
(the `Northerners') and as   by the Te<209>galais (the `Southerners').
Clay, white or yellow, is used for marking the outer lines and turmeric ç
or ·r<200>c<220>r<207>a (a kind of red powder) for marking the central ç
line.
@NT = <188>rmil<193>
If S<200>t<193> is the very personification of ideal wifehood, <188>rmil<193> ç
is equally the ideal of wifely sacrifice. She too was the daughter ç
of Janaka and was married to Lak<218>ma<207>a. When Lak<218>ma<207>a ç
chose to accompany R<193>ma to the forest on his banishment, <188>rmil<193> ç
who had to stay back at Ayodhy<193> led an austere life until he returned.
Lak<218>ma<207>a had two sons†A<209>gada and Candraketu†from her. ç
They were later crowned as the rulers of K<193>rupatha (in the  northwest)  and  Candrak<193>nta  (in ç
Mallabh<220>mi).
<188>rmil<193> is said to have committed sat<200> after Lak<218>ma<207>a's ç
demise (vide R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, Uttarak<193><207><195>a, Chapter ç

@N1 = (`[damsel] born out of the thigh')
When the sages Nara and N<193>r<193>ya<207>a were performing austerities ç
at the Badarik<193>·rama, Indra sent a few of his apsar<193>s (heavenly ç
damsels) to disturb them. Seeing them, the sage N<193>r<193>ya<207>a ç
slapped his own <220>ru or thigh, from which emerged a damsel who ç
was more beautiful than all of them put together. Since she came out ç
of the <220>ru, she was called <188>rva·<200>.
Later, as a result of a curse by S<220>rya (Sun god), she had to live ç
in bh<220>loka (the earth) as the wife of the king Pur<220>ravas.
Once she fell in love with Arjuna who politely refused her advances. ç
She then cursed him to become a eunuch. This curse came in handy for ç
Arjuna at the time of living incognito in Vir<193><219>a's palace. ç
He lived there under the pseudonym B<216>hannal<193>.
@NT = U<218><193>
She was the daughter of B<193><207><193>sura, a demon king who was ç
a contemporary of <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a. Once she dreamt of ç
Aniruddha †grandson of <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a†and fell in love ç
with him. Citralekh<193>, her servant-maid who had magical powers, ç
transported Aniruddha surreptitiously to U<218><193>'s place. The ç
couple lived happily for some time. However, when B<193><207><193>sura ç
came to know of it, he imprisoned both of them. Later on, <185>r<200> ç
K<216><218><207>a invaded B<193><207><193>sura's capital, defeated ç
him and freed both of them (vide Bh<193>gavata 10.62 and 63).
@NT = U·anas
@SPACE = 
@SPACE = 
U·anas is an ancient sage mentioned even in the <184>gveda (8.84; ç
9.87, 88, 89). There, his name is stated as K<193>vya U·anas. He helped ç
Indra to get back the cows abducted by the Pa<207>is (a tribe with ç
a bad reputation).
Lord K<216><218><207>a says in the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (10.37) ç
that he is U·anas among the kavis or wise men.
Since Kau<219>ilya (300 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) has quoted U·anas several times, ç
it can be surmised that he was the author of an important treatise ç
on political science.
The Pa<210>cavi<221>·a Br<193>hma<207>a (7.5.20) states that U·anas ç
was the priest of the asuras. He is thus identified with <185>ukr<193>c<193>rya, ç
the guru of the asuras, as depicted in the epics and the pur<193><207>as.
Two works attributed to him are available in the manuscript form.
They are: Au·anasa-dharma·<193>stra and Au·anasa-dharmas<220>tra.
The Au·anasa-dharma·<193>stra is in prose with a few verses. A few ç
of the more important subjects dealt with are: a·auca (ceremonial ç
impurity on birth and death); the four var<207>as and mixed castes; ç
pr<193>ya·cittas or expiations; ·r<193>ddha (obsequial rites); punishment ç
for mah<193>p<193>takas (heinous sins); fourteen kinds of sciences ç
(known as Caturda·a-vidy<193>s).
The Au·anasa-dharmas<220>tra contains several passages in prose. ç
Several divergent views of Vasi<218><219>ha, H<193>r<200>ta, <185>aunaka ç
and Gautama are quoted on some important points.
From the quotations in other works it is reasonable to conclude that ç
there was a work by U·anas dealing with the subjects like <193>c<193>ra ç
(daily conduct), vyavah<193>ra (secular and social dealings) and pr<193>ya·citta.
Another work called Au·anasa-sm<216>ti has also been discovered. ç
It contains 600 verses spread over nine chapters. It deals with the ç
following subjects: upanayana, Vedic studies, dharmas of a sn<193>taka ç
(See <MS>SN°TAKA<D> for details.), ·r<193>ddha and pr<193>ya·cittas ç
(expiations for sins).
U·anas has been quoted by several dharma·<193>stra writers.
The <185>ukran<200>tis<193>ra of <185>ukr<193>c<193>rya is definitely ç
a late work and has nothing to do with U·anas.
@NT = U<218>as
@N1 = (`one who shines')
In the <184>gveda dawn has been deified as the goddess U<218>as. ç
There are twenty s<220>ktas devoted to her.
These s<220>ktas are highly poetical descriptions of the goddess.
A few of these may be given here as a sample:
She is eternal since she comes every-day, in the same form (1.92.10).
She  destroys  darkness  that  has enveloped the world (1.92.4).
She wakes up all beings and engages them in their work (4.51.5).
She comes in a brilliant golden chariot (1.48.7).
S<220>rya, the Sun, is her husband (7.75.5).
Only after her arrival, fires begin to burn and sacrifices are undertake<%10>n<%0>(7.80.1).
The Vedic sage prays to her to give him wealth and long life (7.82.6).
@NT = U<218>asti C<193>kr<193>ya<207>a
U<218>asti C<193>kr<193>ya<207>a was an young br<193>hma<207>a priest ç
who lived in the Ibhya- gr<193>ma (a village inhabited by mahouts). ç
Once the crops of that area were destroyed by hailstorms resulting ç
in a severe famine. U<218>asti secured a few forest beans that were ç
being eaten by a mahout and then managed to go to the place where ç
a king was performing a sacrifice. Seeing that the priests like the ç
prastot<193>, the udg<193>t<193> as also the pratihart<193> (the priests ç
representing the S<193>maveda) were ignorant of the deities connected ç
with the mantras they were to chant, he challenged them to reveal ç
the same. When they fell silent, the king enquired who he was. Coming ç
to know his identity, the king was happy since he had been searching ç
for him, without success, to assist in his sacrifice. At the request ç
of the king, U<218>asti C<193>kr<193>ya<207>a accepted the responsibility ç
of completing the sacrifice.
Later on, at the specific requests of the three priests he taught ç
them the three deities: Pr<193><207>a for prast<193>va; °ditya for ç
udg<200>tha and Anna for pratih<193>ra.
Prast<193>va, udg<200>tha and pratih<193>ra are the first three of ç
the five fundamental steps in the singing of a s<193>ma chant.
The whole episode appears in the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad (1.10; ç
1.11).
@NT = U·<200>nara
U·<200>nara was a king of the Candra-va<221>·a (lunar dynasty). He ç
was ruling over the country called Bhoja. His wife was M<193>dhav<200> ç
(daughter of the king Yay<193>ti). <185>ibi, the famous king who was ç
prepared to sacrifice his life to save that of a dove, was his son.
U·<200>nara was also the name of a country mentioned in the Mah<193>bh<193>rata ç
(Kar<207>aparva 5) conquered by Arjuna.

It is the teaching given by the sage Utathya (or Ucathya) to the king ç
M<193>ndh<193>t<193> of the solar dynasty. This has been recounted ç
by Bh<200><218>ma to the king Yudhi<218><219>hira.
The total number of verses is 96.
It delineates in detail the duties of a king, what he is expected ç
to do and what he was to abjure.
The work repeatedly stresses that the primary duty of a king is to ç
protect dharma and the people under his care and not selfish enjoyment ç
of the pleasures of life.
The following are some of his duties and responsibilities:
Sticking to the path of dharma in his personal life and ruling the ç
kingdom according to it; performing the Vedic sacrifices as prescribed ç
by the scriptures and honouring the priests generously; employing ç
honest and efficient persons as ministers and high officers; preventing ç
his subjects from going astray and committing sins; punishing the ç
wicked; protecting the br<193>hma<207>as who are the custodians of ç
dharma; earning and spending money as per the rules of dharma; developing ç
enough strength to protect himself and his kingdom; protecting the ç
weak against the strong; not burdening people by high taxation; meting ç
out justice impartially; earning the goodwill of the people by all ç
righteous means; destroying the enemies and strengthening the bonds ç
with genuine friends.

He is the author of one of the basic works of Kashmir <185>aivism, ç
called ®·vara-pratyabhij<210><193>k<193>rik<193>. He has tried to ç

@NT = utp<193>ta
@N1 = (`reversal of natural order')
Belief in certain unnatural occurrences presaging future events is ç
common to mankind since the ancient days. Such occurrences are called ç
adbhuta or nimitta or utp<193>ta. The words adbhuta and utp<193>ta ç
are used as synonyms. Utp<193>ta always indicates the evil happenings.
The epics and the pur<193><207>as are full of descriptions of these ç
utp<193>tas. Their effects can, generally speaking, be offset or reduced ç
by the performance of ·<193>ntis. (See <MS><185>°NTIS<D> for details.)
The utp<193>tas are divided into three classes: divya (arising from ç
heavenly sources); <193>ntarik<218>a (springing from the atmospheric ç
region); bhauma (appearing on the earth).
Divya is indicated by the abnormal condition of the planets and the ç
stars, likeeclipses and appearance of comets. °ntarik<218>a utp<193>tas ç
are hurricanes, unusual clouds, fall of meteors, abnormal reddish ç
appearances of the quarters and strange rainfall (like bloodred water). ç
Bhauma utp<193>tas are earthquakes and unusual states of water reservoirs.
A few of the utp<193>tas mentioned in the epics and the pur<193><207>as ç
may now be set out here:
Terrible dreams; constant howling of jackals; solar eclipse at an ç
unusual time;flashes of lightnings without clouds; carnivorous birds ç
like vultures sitting on temples, fort-walls and bastions; spontaneous ç
fires; haloes round the sun and the moon; rain of mud or blood-red ç
water; images of gods trembling, dancing, laughing or weeping; strange ç
births as of an ass from a cow and so on.
When such utp<193>tas occur, it is the duty of the king to get the ç
appropriate ·<193>ntis performed.

The most common meanings of this word are: a general rule; giving ç
gifts; giving up. Its opposite is apav<193>da or exception.
However, it is used in a technical sense also with regard to Vedic ç
studies. A Vedic student has to start his studies in  the  month  of  <185>r<193>va<207>a  (August/ ç
September) and close in the month of Pu<218>ya (January/February). ç
This ceremonial closing, before beginning it again, is called utsarga ç

In general, the word means a festive occasion, though quite a few ç
fanciful definitions have been offered.
Utsava†festivals and sacred days† gradually replaced the Vedic sacrifices ç

Utsavas are a special feature of Hindu temples. They are classified ç
in various ways. The most common classification is as follows:

@NID = Nitya†routine festivities conventionally fixed for the whole ç
year, month and day.
@SPACE =

@NID = K<193>mya†festivals conducted to secure the desires of the ç

@SPACE = 
There are other types of classifications also.
Temple utsavas of a major kind like the brahmotsava generally involve ç
the following procedure:
A<209>kur<193>ropa (sowing of sprouts); dhvaj<193>roha<207>a (hoisting ç
of the temple flag to indicate the commencement of the utsava); bher<200>n<193>da ç
(beating the big drum of the temple); y<193>ga and homa (fire- rituals);  baliprad<193>na  (food-offerings); ç
mahotsava (processions); t<200>rthasn<193>na (bathing the deity in ç
the temple tank); pu<218>pay<193>ga  (flower-worship);  dhvaj<193>va- ç
roha<207>a (bringing down the flag).
See also <MS>HINDU TEMPLES<D>.
@NT = utsavam<220>rti
The main image in the Hindu temple is generally made of stone and ç
is fixed permanently to the pedestal. It is called dhruvabera or acalabera ç
(See <MS>BERA<D> for more details.). Apart from this, there will be ç
a few more (two to five) icons made of metal. They are movable ones, ç
hence called calaberas or calam<220>rtis.
The most important of these, which is used for processional purposes, ç
either in a ratha (chariot) or in a ·ibik<193> (palanquin),  is  called  utsavam<220>rti  or ç
utsavabera. Being next in importance, it is usually kept in the sanctum ç
itself, close to the main image and connected with it by a golden ç
thread called sambandhas<220>tra.
It may also be kept outside the sanctum in a separate cell called ç
ardha-ma<207><195>apa or ·ukan<193>s<200>.
This image is an exact replica of the original†except in the case ç
of <185>ivali<209>gas† and is big enough to permit elaborate decorations ç
with garments and garlands as also ornaments.
It should always be either in the standing posture (sth<193>naka) ç
or sitting posture (<193>s<200>na) but never in the reclining (·ay<193>na) ç
posture even though the dhruva-bera (like Ra<209>gan<193>tha images) ç
may be in that posture.
No worship is normally offered to the main image in the temple as ç
long as the utsavam<220>rti is out.
@SPACE1 = 
The utsavam<220>rtis of Vi<218><207>u (in any aspect) are always accompanied ç
by the images of <185>r<200>dev<200> and Bh<220>dev<200> even though ç
these images may not be there in the main sanctum.
