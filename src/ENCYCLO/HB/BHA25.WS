Curiously enough, the name `N<193>r<193>-ya<207>a' (`the one who dwells ç
in the casual waters' or `the abode of man') has been applied<|>to ç
him first and later only to Vi<218><207>u.
Brahm<193>, the creator and Sarasvat<200>, his consort, are the subjects ç
of several tales in our mythological literature. They can be summarised ç
briefly thus:
1.<+>Brahm<193> was born out of the golden egg produced in the boundless ç
causal waters. His consort V<193>c or Sarasvat<200> was manifested ç
out of him. From their union were born all the creatures of the world.
2.<+>Brahm<193> represents the Vedas and Sarasvat<200>, their spirit ç
and meaning. Hence all knowledge, sacred and secular, has proceeded ç
from them.
3.<+>Once Brahm<193> became the boar and raised the earth from beneath ç
the waters and created the world, the sages and Praj<193>pati.
4.<+>The forms of tortoise and fish, (later considered as avat<193>ras ç
of Vi<218><207>u) have been attributed to Brahm<193> also.
5.<+>The  great  sages  Mar<200>ci,  Atri, A<209>giras and others are ç
his `mind-born' children. Manu, the Adam of the °ryan race, is his ç
great-grandson.
6.<+>He is easily pleased with auster-ities and bestows boons on the ç
supplicants, be they gods, demons or human beings.
7.<+>He is the inventor of the theatrical art. Music, dance and stagecraft ç
were revealed by him.
8. He was the chief priest who per- formed the marriage of P<193>rvat<200> ç
with <185>iva.
In spite of the fact that Brahm<193> is God the Supreme in the creative ç
aspect and is an equally important member of the Hindu Trinity, it ç
is strange that there are no temples dedicated exclusively to him, ç
the one at Pu<218>kar (near Ajmer in Rajasthan) being the solitary ç
exception. Notwithstanding the crude reasons given in some of the ç
pur<193><207>as for the loss of Brahm<193>'s prestige, it is likely ç
that the Brahm<193> cult was predominant in the pre-Vedic Hinduism ç
and was superseded by the later <185>iva-Vi<218><207>u cults. In fact, ç
the evolution of the <185>akti concept†each of the gods <185>iva and ç
Vi<218><207>u having his <185>akti or Power as his consort †and the ç
explanation that creation proceeds from the combination of the God ç
and his <185>akti, has made Brahm<193> superfluous.
The icon of Brahm<193> has four heads facing the four quarters, and ç
they represent the four Vedas, the four yugas (epochs of time), and ç
the four var<207>as (divisions of society based on nature, nurture ç
and vocation). Usually the faces have beards and the eyes are closed ç
in mediation. There are four arms holding different objects and in ç
different poses. The arms represent the four quarters. The objects ç
usually  shown  are:  ak<218>am<193>l<193>  (rosary), k<220>rca (a ç
brush of ku·a grass), sruk (ladle), sruva (spoon), kama<207><195>alu ç
(waterpot) andpustaka (book). The combination and arrangement vary ç
from image to image.
The rosary represents time and the waterpot, the causal waters, from ç
which all creation has sprung up. So, Brahm<193> controls time as ç
well as the principle of causation. The ku·a grass, the ladle and ç
the spoon being sacrificial implements, represent the system of sacrifices ç
which is the means to be adopted by the various creatures to sustain ç
one another. The book stands for knowledge, sacred and secular. He ç
is the giver of all knowledge†arts, sciences and wisdom.
The mudr<193>s or poses of the hand are abhaya (assuring protection) ç
and varada (granting boons).
The icon may be either in the standing posture (standing on a lotus) ç
or in the sitting posture (sitting on a ha<221>sa or swan). Ha<221>sa ç
or the swan stands for discrimination and wisdom.
In the temples dedicated exclusively to Brahm<193>, his aspect as ç
Vi·vakarma (the architect of the universe) is adopted. In this form ç
he is shown as having four heads, four arms holding the rosary, the ç
book, the ku·a grass and the kama<207><195>alu and riding on his swan.
Every temple, be it of <185>iva or Vi<218><207>u, must have a niche ç
in the northern wall for Brahm<193>, and his icon must receive worship ç
everyday since he is an important pariv<193>radevat<193> (attendant ç
of the Chief deity).
Brahm<193> is also the name applied to one of the four principal priests ç
in a Vedic sacrifice. He is the most learned of all andisrequired ç
to know the three Vedas for his professional duties. He acts as a ç
presiding officer of a sacrifice and is silentmost of the time. He ç
instructs the adhvaryu priest when his advice is sought for. It is ç
he who prescribes the pr<193>ya·cittas (expiatory  rites)  when  mistakes  are ç
committed in a sacrifice.
In later Vedic literature, he came to be associated with the Atharvaveda.

@NT = brahmacarya
@N1LS = (`conduct pertaining to Brahman')
@EMERGENCY = One of the words used extensively in the Hindu religious ç
literature is the word `brahmacarya.'
Etymologically speaking, the word can mean two things: `Movement (cary<193>) ç
in Brahman.' `Code of conduct (cary<193>) (to be observed during the ç
period of studying the) Vedas (Brahman).'
When a Vedic student was learning the Vedas in the house of his preceptor, ç
he had to lead a very strict life, wherein celibacy or continence ç
was the most important discipline. Hence the word `brahmacarya' is, ç
more commonly, interpreted as celibacy.
Celibacy centres round the control and the ultimate sublimation of ç
the sexual instinct. Sex, again, is an instinct of the body. Hence, ç
the best solution to the problems created by the sex-instinct is transcending ç
the body-consciousness itself and rising to the soul-consciousness. ç
This becomes possible only when the mind dwells constantly on Brahman, ç
the Absolute, to such an extent that the body is forgotten. Hence ç
the very first meaning given is, perhaps, more accurate and includes ç
the latter too.
Of the four stages of life, technically called the `<193>·ramas,' ç
the first is known as the `brahmacary<193>·rama' or just `brahmacarya;' ç
and the student undergoing it is called a `brahmac<193>rin'.
A brahmac<193>rin entered the gurukula or the house of the preceptor ç
for studying the Vedas as also other sciences, after undergoing the ç
sacrament of upanayana. The period of this brahmacarya was usually ç
twelve years, though it could be more.
@SPACE1 = 
The following are some of the rulesand discipline that a brahmac<193>rin ç
was expected to observe: strict celibacy, speaking the truth, gentleness ç
in speech, physical austerities like cold water bath, eating sparingly ç
at night and service to the preceptor, devotion to study and contemplation.
He was to beg his food and could partake of it only after offering ç
it to the preceptor.
Though brahmacarya or celibacy wasobligatory for the brahmac<193>rins ç
and the sa<221>ny<193>sins (monks), even the householders were advised ç
to observe it as best as they could.

Brahman, not just the primary reality, but as the only reality and ç
that it is `advaita,' `the one without a second'. This proposition ç
seems to have been put forward not only as the most essential teaching ç
of the Upani<218>ads, but also to counter the <185>abd<193>dvaita-v<193>da ç
of the grammar schools which propounded that `<185>abda' or the `Word' ç

@N1 = (`Song of Brahm<193>')
The Mah<193>bh<193>rata, considered as the `Pa<210>cama-veda' or ç
the fifth Veda, has enriched human life as also itself by bequeathing ç
the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> to the posterity. However, the same epic ç
also contains several other pieces of religious discourses, each one ç
of them with a different name, but with word `g<200>t<193>' affixed ç
to it. Of the sixteen such g<200>t<193>s, the Brahmag<200>t<193> ç
also is one. It comprises just nine verses, from the 4th to 12th verse, ç
in chapter 35 of the Anu·<193>sanaparva.
In the course of his long discourse to Yudhi<218><219>hira, the eldest ç
of the P<193><207><195>ava princes, Bh<200><218>ma, the grandsire, ç
narrates how in the beginning of this cycle of creation Brahm<193>, ç
the Creator, brought forth the four var<207>as or classes of human ç
beings†the br<193>hma<207>as, the k<218>attriyas, the vai·yas and ç
the ·<220>dras†and taught them wisdom.
The br<193>hma<207>as were advised to live a life of self-control, ç
to study the Vedas with devotion, to offer sacrifices to the gods ç
in heaven and not to hurt any being. They could get whatever they ç
wanted, just by tapas (austerity) and j<210><193>na (know-ledge). ç
Healso exhorted them to never stoop to performing the works meant ç
for the ·<220>dras. That would degrade them spiritually.
Since dharma was preserved by such br<193>hma<207>as, he counselled ç
the other three classes to protect and serve the br<193>hma<207>as.
Because this teaching was delivered by Brahm<193>, it has been named ç
as the Brahmag<200>t<193>.
There is a Brahmag<200>t<193> in the S<220>tasa<221>hit<193> which ç

@NT = Brahmagupta
Brahmagupta was a pioneer in the field of mathematics and astronomy. ç
He was born during <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 598 in Bhinmal in the Jalore district ç
of Rajasthan. His principal works are Br<193>hmasphu<219>a Siddh<193>nta ç
and Kha<207><195>akh<193>dyakara<207>a. The former, composed in ç

Sv<193>min (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 860), in detail, probably following the ç
tradition of the original author.
As a mathematician, Brahmagupta is famous for his work on cakr<200>yacaturbhuja ç
or cyclic quadrilaterals. His astronomical writings were well-known ç
in Western India even by <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 712.
The length of the year as determined by him is slightly less than ç
what is accepted by most of the astronomical texts.
Bh<193>skar<193>c<193>rya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1114-1160), the celebrated ç

br<193>hma<207>a')
@SPACE = 
Though man is essentially divine in nature, he is prone to vice and ç
committing crimes, thus incurring p<193>taka or p<193>pa or sin. This ç
is mainly due to the evil tendencies carried over from the past lives.
Etymologically, the word p<193>pa (sin) is defined as `that from which ç
one has to protect onesel<%16>f<%0>'. It arises first in the mind ç
as the tendency towards vice and manifests itself either in neglecting ç
the prescribed duties or in committing prohibited actions. The scriptures ç
are the primary, if not the sole, authority in this field.
The dharma·<193>stras†the works that deal with the religio-social ç
life of the Hindus†have classified sins into two major groups: the ç
mah<193>p<193>takas or atip<193>takas (major or mortal sins) and upap<193>takas ç
(minor or venial sins).
Brahmahaty<193> or the killing of a saintly br<193>hma<207>a, is one ç
of the mah<193>p<193>takas that is often mentioned in these works. ç
Any act that will lead either indirectly or directly to the slaying ç
of a br<193>hma<207>a is brahmahaty<193>. Even incitement or approval ç
is liable to be branded as brahmahaty<193>. And it entails unbearable ç
suffering.
One does not incur brahmahaty<193> if one kills a br<193>hma<207>a ç
who is an <193>tat<193>yin (a criminal guilty of grave offences), ç
in self-defence.
With regard to its expiation, there does not seem to be any unanimity ç
among the writers of these works. It ranges from death, up to undergoing ç
severe austerities like offering one's limbs into fire, walking very ç
long distances with very little or no food, performing sacrifices ç
like A·vamedha or Abhijit or Gosava and so on.

@NT = brahmaj<210><193>na
@N1 = (`Knowledge of Brahman')
The Ved<193>nta system of philosophy posits Brahman (`the Unlimited ç
One,' `the Infinite One,' `the Absolute') as the origin of the entire ç
universe including the inanimate nature and the living beings. The ç
universe evolves out of it, is sustained in it and involves back into ç
it. Its essential nature is `sat-cit-<193>nanda,' `existence-consciousness-bliss'. ç
It is uncaused and eternal. It is also the very essence of the human ç
beings. Since the human beings do not know this Brahman that is in ç
them or behind them, they are undergoing a lot of suffering caused ç
by the vicious circle of birth-death-rebirth, technically called `sa<221>s<193>ra'. ç
Mok<218>a or liberating oneself from the bondage of this sa<221>s<193>ra, ç
is the ultimate goal of life. Thismok<218>a can be achieved only ç
by brahmaj<210><193>na.
Though the word `j<210><193>na' means `knowledge,' `brahmaj<210><193>na' ç
does not mean an intellectual understanding of Brahman. It is anubh<220>ti ç
or direct experience of Brah- man, not only as the substratum of the ç
entire creation, but also as the innermost core of oneself. Once this ç
direct experience comes, there will no more be any identification ç
with the body-mind complex which alone was responsible for sa<221>s<193>ra.
In order to get this experience, one has to cultivate the s<193>dhanacatu<218><219>aya ç
first. (See <MS>S°DHANACATU<186><187>AYA<D> for details.) This is ç
to be followed by approaching a competent spiritual preceptor from ç
whom one has to listen (·rava<207>a) to the Ved<193>ntic truths, reflect ç
(manana) upon them and meditate (nididhy<193>sana) upon them. This ç
will ultimately lead to brahmaj<210><193>na or the direct experience ç
of Brahman†often equated with <193>tman, the Self†and result in mok<218>a.

The concept of sin (p<193>taka, p<193>pa, agha, enas) is as old as ç
the <184>gveda itself. Later literature like the sm<216>tis and ç
the dharma·astras have dealt with it in great detail.  Among  the  several  remedies, ç
austerities of a particular class are given the general name `k<216>cchra.' ç
The word means `that which cuts, causes pain and suffering.'
Of the several k<216>cchras mentioned, brahmak<216>cchra is also one. ç
It is difficult to say what exactly the word `brahma' connotes here. ç
Out of the several secondary meanings of the word, `tapas' (austerity) ç
and `bhogaty<193>ga' (renunciation of objects of pleasure) may be ç
more appropriate here. It is an austerity involving the giving up ç
of objects of pleasure.
Brahmak<216>cchra is a penance spread over twelve days. It consists ç
in sustaining oneself during that period, by drinking at noon, a little ç
pa<210>cagavya†a preparation of the five products of a cow, viz., ç
milk, curds, ghee, urine and dung†in a temple or a cow-pen, after ç
offering it with mantras in fire. Meditation on Vi<218><207>u, sleeping ç
near an idol of Vi<218><207>u and abjuring certain luxuries like betel ç

@N1 = (`the world of Brahm<193>')
The state of a human being before birth and after death has always ç
been a mystery to us, though the various religions of the world have ç
offered their own explanations.
According to the Upani<218>ads and otherallied scriptures, three ç
destinies are possible for a human being: to be reborn here, to go ç
to the Pit<216>loka or the world of manes and to go to the Brahmaloka ç
or Satyaloka, the abode of Brahm<193>.
The path to the Pit<216>loka lies through the Pit<216>y<193>na or ç
Dak<218>i<207><193>yana or Dh<220>m<193>di-m<193>rga, the path of ç
smoke.
The path to the Brahmaloka lies through the Devay<193>na or Uttar<193>ya<207>a ç
or Arcir<193>dim<193>rga, the path of light.
The Brahmaloka, also known as the Satyaloka, is the final destination ç
of those who have purified themselves by austerities and meditation. ç
They do not return to this mundane existence. They will be there till ç
the end of the kalpa or the cycle of creation. When the Brahmaloka ç
too gets dissolved in the Supreme Brahman, they will also get merged ç
in It. This is called Kramamukti or gradual liberation as against ç
sadyomukti or instant liberation.
The pur<193><207>as describe Brahmaloka as the highest of the fourteen ç
worlds, six being above this earth and seven, below. The denizens ç
of this Brahmaloka are said to be completely free from all passions ç
and limitations of the physical body, unlike here.
Sometimes, the two worlds below Brahmaloka, viz., the Janaloka and ç
the Tapoloka, are also classed with the Brahmaloka and called as such.

Mantras  are  mystic  syllabus  or formulae supposed to be endowed ç

can be classified into two groups: the Sagu<207>a-mantras and the ç
Br<193>hma-mantras.
The former are connected with the Sagu<207>a Brahman (Brahman with ç
attri-butes) and the latter with the Nirgu<207>a Brahman (Brahman ç
without attributes). Whereas up<193>san<193> or meditation with theformer ç
leads to savikalpa-sam<193>dhi (sam<193>dhi in which the mind takes ç
the form of the deity and results in its reali- zation), up<193>san<193> ç

The well-known mah<193>v<193>kyas (`great sentences') culled from ç

One of the most widely used terms in the Hindu religious literature, ç
the word `Brahman' has several senses: the Vedas, hymns of praise, ç
a priest, one of the four principal priests in a sacrifice representing ç
the Atharvaveda, a br<193>hma<207>a, tapas or austerity, God the ç
Creator (the four-faced Brahm<193>) and the Supreme Spirit or the ç
Absolute. However it is in the last sense that it is extensively used, ç
and hence needs greater explanation.
An oft-occurring theme in the Upani<218>ads is the assumption and ç
search for the unity in diversity. `What is that, by knowing which, ç
everything else is known?'†is a typical question that is raised in ç
them (Mu<207><195>aka Upani<218>ad. 1.1.3; B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka ç
Upani<218>ad. 4.5.6; Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad 6.1.3). The sages ç
of the Upani<218>ads realized in the depths of their mystical experience, ç
that there was a basic reality underlying the entire universe of multiplicity, ç
the One without a second, and called it `Brahman'.
The word `Brahman' is derived from the root `b<216>h' (`to grow,' ç
`to burst forth') and hence means that which is immense and that from ç
which everything else has come out. In other words, it is from Brahman ç
that this world has evolved, it is in Brahman that it rests even after ç
this evolution and again, it is to that Brahman that it returns at ç
the time of involution. `S<216><218><219>i,' `sthiti' and `laya' or ç
`pralaya' are the three words generally used to indicate these processes. ç
Brahman, however, remains unaffected by this evolution or involution ç
and is ever full and perfect (p<220>r<207>a) in itself.
The intrinsic power of Brahman with which it creates this world, sustains ç
it and withdraws it into itself, is called `m<193>y<193>'.
Since creation is only an evolution of Brahman†which evolution is ç
considered as only apparent and not real, according to some schools ç
of Ved<193>nta†Brahman continues to exist in it as the immanent reality. ç
Thus it is both transcendent and immanent simultaneously.
Quite often, the Upani<218>ads use the word `°tman' as synonymous ç
with Brahman. Sat, Ak<218>ara and Bh<220>m<193> are someof the other ç
terms used to indicate Brahman.
@SPACE1 = 
The evolution of the world from the Brahman/°tman is generally traced ç
as follows: From the Brahman evolves <193>k<193>·a (ether); from <193>k<193>·a ç
comes v<193>yu (wind) from v<193>yu comes agni (fire), from agni comes ç
ap (water) and from ap comes p<216>thiv<200> (earth). Vegetation and ç
then, life (including the human beings) evolve out of this earth.
In the Ved<193>ntic works based on the Upani<218>ads, four aspects ç
of Brahman have been put forth: the Absolute called Brahman, the creative ç
spirit ®·vara (Lord, God), the world-spirit Hira<207>yagarbha and ç
the world, Vir<193>j.
The totality of creation which is none other than Brahman in essence, ç
is the Vir<193>j. When Brahman is thought of as the spirit moving ç
everywhere in the world, it is called Hira<207>yagarbha. When conceived ç
as the personal God engaged in the act of creation, protection and ç
destruction of the world, it is called ®·vara. When believed to be ç
established in itself independent of any creation, it is Brahman, ç
the Absolute.
The Reality is not a sum of these. It is an ineffable unity in which ç
these conceptual distinctions are made.
Brahman, the Absolute, is unique and different from all that we know ç
and experience here. Hence it can be predicated only in negative terms, ç
`neti, neti,' `not this, not this'. This should not mislead us into ç
thinking that it is a non-entity. While it is non-empirical, it is ç
also inclusive of the whole empirical world. And, it has an essential ç
nature of its own: `sat' or being, `cit' or consciousness and `<193>nanda' ç
or bliss. These are not its characteristics but are different phrases ç
for the same being: self- being, self-consciousness and self-delight.

himself as the inmost Self in all the beings (®·<193>vasya Up.1; ç

The Bhagavadg<200>t<193> became a model for the later generation ç

produced by them, the Br<193>hma<207>ag<200>t<193> is also one. ç
Actually it is an integral part of a bigger and more well-known work, ç
the Anug<200>t<193>.
The Br<193>hma<207>ag<200>t<193> comprises the chapters 20 to 34 ç
(15 chapters; 325 verses) of the °·vamedhikaparva, the fourteenth ç
book of the epic Mah<193>bh<193>rata.
The wife of a br<193>hma<207>a approached her husband with an anxious ç
query as to what would happen to her after death since she found him ç
to have abandoned all the actions prescribed in the scriptures and ç
since that would affect her future life also. The br<193>hma<207>a, ç
who was actually an enlightened person, and hence who had transcended ç
all such actions, started teaching her spiritual wisdom in order to ç
uplift her mind.
The teaching is couched in a highly symbolical language and often ç
needs expla- nations.
The subjects dealt with may, very briefly, be summarised as follows: ç
superiority of mind and speech over the other organs, importance of ç
the five pr<193><207>as or vital airs in the body, supremacy of the ç
Lord, who resides in all beings as the antary<193>min or the indweller, ç
stories of Para·ur<193>ma and the king Ambar<200><218>a, and teaching ç

@NT = Br<193>hma<207>as
@N1 = (`[liturgical texts] of<R>ç
Brahman or the Vedas')
The Vedas, the basic scriptures of Hinduism, are broadly divided into ç
two parts: the Sa<221>hit<193>s and the Br<193>hma<207>as. The latter ç
include the °ra<207>yakas and theUpani<218>ads, though these latter ç
two are also considered as two more parts, different from the Sa<221>hit<193>s ç
and the Br<193>hma<207>as.
Whereas the Sa<221>hit<193>s comprise the mantras or hymns in praise ç
of the various Vedic deities like Agni and Indra, the Br<193>hma<207>as, ç
composed in prose, explain the mantras, prescribe their use in sacrifices ç
and also give the know-how of the sacrifices in detail.
Yaj<210>as and y<193>gas†sacrifices offered into the duly consecrated ç
fire†occupied the central place in Vedic religion. Hence, the need ç
for clear and elaborate instructions to conduct them was keenly felt. ç
And, the Br<193>hma<207>as fulfilled that need.
The primary content of the Br<193>hma<207>as can be stated as `vidhi' ç
or injunctions concerning the various rites and rituals which form ç
a part of the sacrificial system. It comprises such details as: when ç
to perform a sacrifice, which sacrifice for which purpose, who is ç
the person fit to perform it, which are the various components, what ç
are the mantras to be used, where and how, and so on.
Apart from the vidhis, the Br<193>hma<207>as also contain other topics: ç
hetu, nirukti, stuti or arthav<193>da and <193>khy<193>na.
Those portions of the work that provide logic and reasoning in support ç
of a vidhi are called `hetu'. Wherever certain words are explained ç
with their etymological derivations, such statements are termed as ç
`nirukti'. Stuti or arthav<193>da comprises the statements of praise ç
in support of the injunctions and of derogation, in support ofprohibitions. ç
°khy<193>nas are stories or narration of ancient incidents interspersed ç
in the body of the Br<193>hma<207>a literature. They are often full ç
of esoteric meanings or philosophical speculations.
The Br<193>hma<207>as occupy a very impor- tant place in the Vedic ç
lore. They provided not only the necessary details for the performance ç
of Vedic rites but also the inspiration to sustain them. The various ç
discussions that used to take place during the Br<193>hma<207>a period, ç
concerning the several aspects of the sacrificial religion, gave rise ç
to the M<200>m<193><221>s<193> system of philosophy.
As in the case of the other ancient Hindu scriptures, it is rather ç
difficult to fix up definitely the date of the Br<193>hma<207>a literature. ç
Whereas the Western Indologists assign the dates 1200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> ç
to <F51320P10MSC1>A.<|>D.<F255P255DC255> 200, the Indian scholars, basing their ç
arguments mainly on the astronomical data available in the Br<193>hma<207>as†like ç
the <185>atapatha Br<193>hma<207>a†push it back to the period 3000 ç
<MS>B.C.<D> to 2000 <MS>B.C.<MI>
The entire Br<193>hma<207>a literature is in prose. It is the most ç
ancient prose in Sanskrit literature available to us now. The sentences ç
are simple and straight. Long compound words or grammatically intricate ç
structures are practically unknown. Hence, it is much more intelligible ç
to the readers. The absence of archaic words found in the Sa<221>hit<193>s ç
and the use of many new words give us the impression that the Sanskrit ç
of the Br<193>hma<207>as represents a transition stage from the Vedic ç
to the classical Sanskrit.
The Br<193>hma<207>as give us an inkling into the contemporary social ç
life too. People were very much devoted to the performance of the ç
sacrifices. Hence they were extensively practised. This naturally ç
led to the br<193>hma<207>as†members of the first of the four var<207>as†occupying ç
the pre-eminent place in the social setup. They were treated practically ç
as gods on earth. However, they had to earn that status through the ç
mastery of the Vedas and tapas or austerities.
The var<207>a system†division of the society into four broad groups ç
based on the natural propensities and professions chosen†had become ç
well-established. The k<218>attriya ruler had to submit himself to ç
the guidance and advice of the br<193>hma<207>as. The vai·yas were ç
devoted to the development of the whole society through their activities ç
of trade, commerce and agriculture. Those who were not capable of ç
the other three vocations contented themselves in living by serving ç
others. They were the ·<220>dras.
Great importance was attached to satya and dharma, truth and righteous ç
behaviour. One who forsook the path of truth was considered unfit ç
for the performance of sacrifices. Slipping into sinful ways would ç
result in a vicious circle, thereby obliging the sinners to commit ç
more heinous sins. Hence it had to be avoided at all costs. Since ç
purity in personal life would conduce to the purity of social life, ç
it was highly regarded and stressed. And, the Vedic sacrifices were ç
believed to help the human beings in achieving this goal.
People hankered for progeny, especi-ally for virtuous sons. A chaste ç
woman was always respected.
Each of the four Vedas has its own Br<193>hma<207>as. Since the number ç
of the extant Br<193>hma<207>as is rather small compared to what has ç
been mentioned in the g<216>hyas<220>tras and other ancient works, ç
it can safely be surmised that many of them have been lost, perhaps ç
irretrievably.

Scholars differ as regards his exact identity. He is identified with ç
several roles: Agni (the fire-god), the priest of god Indra, deity ç
of vegetation and hence a form of candra or the moon and so on.

How this world in which we live and move and have our being, has been ç

the Vedas, the Upani<218>ads, the sm<216>tis and the pur<193><207>as ç
are so different†though there are also some common points†that it ç
becomes rather difficult to take as authoritative any one account. ç
That is why commentators on these works stress the point that the ç

and the need to know him.

he himself was born as Brahm<193>, the Creator. This golden egg is ç

The pur<193><207>as or the mythological scriptures have played, over ç
the centuries, a very constructive and effective role in educating ç
the Hindu masses. These masses had been denied direct access to the ç
studyand knowledge of the Vedas and allied scriptures. However, the ç
need for enlightening them not only in moral and spiritual values ç
but also in certain aspects of secular education, including vocational ç
training, had been keenly felt by the sages and the pragmatic sections ç
of the society. And, the pur<193><207>as fulfilled that need admirably.
The Brahm<193><207><195>apur<193><207>a is the last of the eighteen ç
major pur<193><207>as (mah<193>-pur<193><207>as). It is called so, ç
probably because, it deals with the brahm<193><207><195>a, the world ç
and its creation, as a major subject. Hindu tradition attributes its ç
authorship to the sage Vy<193>sa. It was perhaps composed near the ç
place where the river God<193>var<200> rises (near Nasik of Maharashtra). ç
Generally considered as one of the oldest of the eighteen pur<193><207>as, ç
it might be assigned to the period <F51320MS>A.<|>D.<W1> 300-400.
Since a major part of this pur<193><207>a agrees  with  the  V<193>yupur<193><207>a,  some ç
