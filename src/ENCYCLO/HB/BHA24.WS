A bhik<218>u is one who lives on alms got by begging. However, all ç
beggars are not bhik<218>us. The word is used more in a technical ç
sense and applies to religious mendicants.
Renouncing the world and the worldly life in order to dedicate oneself ç
to spiritual pursuits<|> has<|> been <|>an <|>ancient<|><|>practice<|><|>in ç
India. Such persons generally moved about from place to place, sustaining ç
themselves by begging.
Such a life of renunciation could be adopted from any stage of life†brahmacarya ç
or the stage of a Vedic student, g<193>rhasthya or the stage of a ç
householder and v<193>naprastha or the stage of a forest dweller.
A bhik<218>u represented the order of sa<221>ny<193>sa. He had to ç
live a life of strict self-control and strive his utmost for mok<218>a ç
or liberation.
A  Bhik<218>us<220>tra  attributed  to  one Karmanda has been mentioned ç
in some dharma·<193>stra works, but has not been traced. Another work ç
of the same name attributed to P<193>r<193>·arya (Vy<193>sa) is perhaps ç
the extant Brahmas<220>tras or an earlier version of it.
The word `bhik<218>u' in course of time, came to represent the Buddhist ç
and the Jain mendicants, rather than the Hindu sa<221>ny<193>sins.

@N1 = (`the song of the mendicant')
The Bhagavadg<200>t<193>, the most widely studied scripture of Hinduism ç
has in course of time given rise to a voluminous G<200>t<193>-literature. ç
One of the minor g<200>t<193>s that forms part of another celebrated ç
g<200>t<193>, the Uddhavag<200>t<193> (vide Bh<193>gavata 11.7-29) ç
is the Bhik<218>ug<200>t<193> (11.23)
In the country of Avant<200>, there lived a br<193>hma<207>a rolling ç
in wealth but a miserto the core. His peevish and rude behaviour ç
resulted in successfully driving away all hiskith and kin. Wilful ç
neglect of duties, both temporal and scriptural, made the godsangry ç
with him and they withdrew their grace. So, he lost all his wealth ç
and got vair<193>gya or spirit of renunciation which made him reflect ç
on his past life and behaviour. He then took to the life of a bhik<218>u ç
or mendicant. Wherever he went he was reviled and even assaulted because ç
of his past history. However, he stoically put up with everything ç
taking it all as due to his own past karma. He then taught his own ç
mind thus: `I gave so much trouble to this body in order to earn wealth ç
and not for dharma (righteousness) or k<193>ma (pleasure of the flesh). ç
Wealth thus accumulated by the greedy and the miserly ones ruins all ç
the good one may have. Wealth gives rise to many evils like theft, ç
violence, lust, vanity, and enmity even amongst the loved ones. Those ç
who waste this invaluable human birth in the pursuit of wealth ruin ç
themselves. When death knocks at our doors, money can never rescue ç
us; nor do people or objects of desire. God, the infinitely merciful ç
one, has blessed me thus by deliberately taking away my wealth and ç
possessions. I will now spend the rest of my life in tapas or austerity ç
and be ever vigilant against all selfishness.
`It is the mind†being under the influence of the three gu<207>as†that ç
is responsible for our weal or woe. Control of this mind is the best ç
of yogas. One who successfully accomplishes it is verily a god!'
@NT = Bhik<218>ukopani<218>ad
This is a small work counted among the minor Upani<218>ads and is ç
said to belong to the <185>ukla Yajurveda. It is devoted to a description ç
of the bhik<218>us or mendicants or sa<221>ny<193>sins.
The bhik<218>us desiring for mok<218>a or liberation are of four types: ç
the ku<219><200>cakas, the bah<220>dakas, the ha<221>sas and the paramaha<221>sas.
The ku<219><200>cakas take eight gr<193>sas or mouthfuls of food daily ç
and strive for mok<218>a through the path of yoga. Gautama, Bharadv<193>ja, ç
Y<193>j<210>avalkya, Vasi<218><219>ha and others belong to this group.
The bah<220>dakas wear the insignia of a monk like red-robes, three ç
bamboo staves tied together, a water-pot and so on. They too live ç
upon eight mouthfuls of food got by begging. They avoid honey and ç
flesh even though offered by the host.
The ha<221>sas are itinerant monks who do not stay in a place for ç
more than a day if it is a village or five days if it is a city or ç
seven days if it is a place of pilgrimage. They observe the C<193>ndr<193>ya<207>a ç
rite and practise yoga to obtain mok<218>a.
The paramaha<221>sas like Sa<221>vartaka, °ru<207>i, <185>vetaketu, ç
Ja<195>abharata, <185>uka andothers sustain themselves on eight mouthfuls ç
of food, practise yoga and pray for attaining mok<218>a.
The Upani<218>ad gives a long description of their way of life. They ç
live in secluded places like abandoned houses, burial grounds, temples ç
or under trees or on the banks of rivers. They are unconcerned about ç
their dress and may even move about naked. They accept alms from all, ç
irrespective of their caste. They have transcended all dualities like ç
good and bad and ever contemplate on the °tman. Living thus they give ç
up the body when the time comes to depart.

The heroes and the villains portrayed in the two epics†the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
and the Mah<193>bh<193>rata†have not only swayed the emotions of ç

<185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a, Bh<200><218>ma, Vidura and the P<193><207><195>ava ç
heroes of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata have provided the positive ideals.
Bh<200>ma, or Bh<200>masena the second of the P<193><207><195>avas, ç
was not only the very personification of physical prowess but alsoof ç
fearlessness. Born to Kunt<200>, the first wife of the king P<193><207><195>u, ç
by the grace of V<193>yu, the god of wind, Bh<200>ma was celebrated  for  his  large  frame  and ç
immense strength equal to that of `ten thousand elephants!'All efforts ç
of the wily Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas, an inveterate ç
enemy of the P<193><207><195>avas and especially of B<200>ma, to liquidate ç
him were set at naught by the latter's strength aided by divine grace. ç
Feeding with poisonous food, attack by venomous reptiles and arson ç
were some of the methods tried out by Duryodhana.
Bh<200>ma was an adept in the art of fighting with the gad<193> or ç
the mace, in which he had been vigorously trained by Balar<193>ma, ç
the elder brother of <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a. He had been presented ç
with a divine mace by May<193>sura, the chief architect of the Asuras ç
or demons. Apart from Draupad<200>, the common wife of the P<193><207><195>ava ç
brothers, Bh<200>ma had wedded Hi<195>imb<193> and Jalan-dhar<193>. ç
Gha<219>otkaca, another colossus, was his son from Hi<195>imb<193>.
The number of demons and villains killed by Bh<200>ma was legion: ç
Hi<195>imb<193>sura, Bak<193>sura, Jar<193>sandha and K<200>caka to ç
name a few. He did so under great personal risk but inspired by the ç
desire to protect the good, the meek and the weak.
The crowning success of Bh<200>ma was achieved when he killed Du··<193>sana ç
and Duryodhana (the eldest of the Kaurava brothers) in the Kuruk<218>etra ç
war, thus avenging all the wrongs done by them to the P<193><207><195>ava ç
family.

In all religions, centres of pilgrimage occupy an important place ç
since they bring peace, solace and spiritual upliftment to the persons ç
that visit them. In Hinduism such pilgrim centres are innumerable. ç
Sea-beaches, banks of rivers, hills and dales as also forests are ç
the most favoured places for the location of such centres. they are, ç
almost invariably, associated with some ancient legends concerned ç
with gods or holy persons; or, the resorts of saints and sages. And, ç
of course, there must be some temples too.
One of the less known rivers of India is the Bh<200>m<193>. Taking ç
its birth in the Western Ghats from the summit of the Sahya mountain ç
in Maharashtra, it flows towards the south-east and joins the riverK<216><218><207><193>, ç
a little north of Raichur in Karnataka.
At the source of this river is situated the famous Jyotirli<209>ga, ç
Bh<200>m<193>·a<209>kara, oneof the twelve such li<209>gas mentioned ç
in the ancient and medieval works of Hinduism.
According to one of the legends, Lord <185>iva, after vanquishing ç
Tripur<193>sura, came to this place for rest. At that time, Bh<200>maka, ç
a king of Ayodhy<193>, had been doing tapas or penance there to propitiate ç
<185>iva. Being pleased by his tapas <185>iva revealed himself to ç
the king and offered a boon. The king requested <185>iva that the ç
beads of perspiration on his forehead be discharged as a river for ç
the purification of mankind. Thus was born the river Bh<200>m<193>.
The river Indr<193>ya<207><200> joins Bh<200>m<193> near Tul<193>pur.
Pha<207><195>ar<193>pura, the well-known place of pilgrimage of Maharashtra ç
is situated on the right bank of Bh<200>m<193>.
The river Bh<200>m<193> is also called Bh<200>marath<200>; and occasionally, ç
as Mah<193>nad<200> too.
The word Bh<200>m<193> is sometimes used to denote Durg<193>.

One of the most well-known and popular days of religious observances ç
in the lunar calendar of the Hindus, is the ek<193>da·<200>. It is ç
the eleventh day from the full-moon or the new-moon, each month. It ç
is considered as a `vrata' or a religious observance,  characterised  mainly  by ç
fasting.
(See <MS>EK°DA<185>®<D> for details.)
Out of the several ek<193>da·<200>s considered as even more sacred, ç
Bh<200>maik<193>da·<200> is one. According to the Matsyapur<193><207>a. ç
(69.19-65) <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a is said to have imparted ç
the knowledge of the Bh<200>ma-dv<193>da<218><200> vrata including ç
those rites to be performed on the da·am<200> (the tenth) and the ç
ek<193>da·<200> (the eleventh) days to Bh<200>ma, the second of theP<193><207><195>ava ç
princes. Hencethe names `Bhimaik<193>da·<200>' and `Bh<200>madv<193>da·<200>'. ç
They are observed on the eleventh and the twelfth of the bright fortnight ç
of the month of M<193>gha (February), with or without the conjunction ç
of the star Pu<218>ya. The latter day used to be called `Kaly<193><207>in<200>' ç
also.
On the tenth day (M<193>gha ·ukla da·am<200>) the votary is expected ç
to take a bath after applying ghee to his body and worship Vi<218><207>u ç
with the mantra `O<221> namo n<193>r<193>ya<207><193>ya' followed ç
by the worship of Garu<195>a, <185>iva and Ga<207>e·a. On the eleventh ç
day (ek<193>da·<200>) a total fast is to be observed. On the next ç
day (dv<193>da·<200>) he has to bathe in a river, raise a ma<207><195>apa ç
or a pavilion in front of his house, hang a jar full of water but ç
with a hole at the bottom, receive the drops of water on his palm ç
repeating the name of God throughout the night and perform homa (offering ç
oblations into a duly consecrated fire) the next morning with the ç
help of twelve priests learned in the Vedas, honouring them suitably ç
at the end. On the thirteenth day (trayoda·<200>), 13 cows have to ç
be donated. He should then listen to the itih<193>sas and pur<193><207>as.
According to some versions, this vratawas taught by the sage Pulastya ç
to the king Bh<200>ma who was the father of Damayant<200>, the wife ç
of Nala.

bad dreams or un- favourable deities.
When a person reaches the age of 77 years, 7 months and 7 days, that ç

@N1 = (`the terrible')
The Mah<193>bh<193>rata, the bigger of the two epics of Hinduism ç
and the greatest didactic poem of the world, has held up before us ç
many a hero fit to be emulated if not adored. And, Bh<200><218>ma, ç
the grand-sire of the Kaurava race, is pre-eminent among them. Ranked ç
as next only to K<216><218><207>a, considered as God-incarnate, Bh<200><218>ma ç
was not only the greatest of the warriors of his times, he was also ç
a towering intellect and a paragon of virtues.
Originally a Vasu (one of the eight attendants of Indra) he was born, ç
due to a curse, as the eighth son of the king <185>antanu in Ga<209>g<193>, ç
the river goddess. Ga<209>g<193> christened him as `Devavrata,' brought ç
him up well, got him well- educated and trained under the warrior-sage ç
Para·ur<193>ma and then handed him back to the king <185>antanu. The ç
king took him to his capital, Hastin<193>pura, and made him the Yuvar<193>ja ç
or the crown-prince.
One day, <185>antanu who had gone out hunting, fell in love with Satyavat<200>, ç
the daughter of the chieftain of the fishermen. When he proposed to ç
marry her, the chieftain laid the condition that the son that would ç
be born in her should be the heir to the throne. The king obviously ç
could not concede the demand as it would be a great injustice to Devavrata, ç
who was the fittest heir anointed to be so. However, the lovelorn ç
king could neither forget the girl nor consent to the condition laid ç
by her father. This conflict had a devastating effect on him. When ç
Devavrata noticed it and learnt of the details, he went to the chieftain, ç
vowed before him that he would willingly abdicate his right over the ç
kingdom, nor would he ever marry so that hisprogeny could never stake ç
its claim overit. This terrible vow earned him the name `Bh<200><218>ma,' ç
`the terrible' which stuck.
<185>antanu married satyavat<200> and begot two sons†Citr<193><209>gada ç
and Vicitrav<200>rya. Both of them died without issues. Then,at the ç
request of Satyavat<200> and as per the `niyoga' custom (See <MS>NIYOGA<D> ç
for details.) that was prevalent during those days, sage Vy<193>sa ç
raised issues in Ambik<193> and Amb<193>lik<193> the queens of Vicitrav<200>rya. ç
The two sons were named Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra and P<193><207><195>u. ç
The former was born blind.
Bh<200><218>ma brought them up, got them married and, they in course ç
of time, had their own children: the hundred Kauravas and the five ç
P<193><207><195>avas. Duryodhana and Du··<193>sana were the first ç
two among the Kauravas. The P<193><207><195>vas were: Yudhi<218><219>hira, ç
Bh<200>ma, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva.
There was constant rivalry between these two groups of cousins, Duryodhana ç
being the villain while Yudhi<218><219>hira was the paragon of dharma ç
or righteousness. Duryodhana made several attempts to decimate the ç
P<193><207><195>avas, but destiny always sided with the latter. Bh<200><218>ma ç
had quite a tough time in forging a working alliance between them ç
and his sage counsels often had their effect and prevented many a ç
crisis.
After the marriage of the P<193><207><195>avas with Draupad<200>, ç
Bh<200><218>ma was instrumental in recalling them from their self-imposed ç
exile and returning them their share of the kingdom. The P<193><207><195>avas ç
built a beauti-ful capital city and named it Indraprastha. However, ç
Duryodhana succeeded in usurping their kingdom by jealous machinations ç
and insulted Draupad<200>, the P<193><207><195>ava queen, in the open ç
assembly. But their kingdom and wealth were restored to them by the ç
intervention of the blind king Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra.
This truce was however shortlived. In a subsequent game of dice, Yudhi<218><219>hira ç
lost everything and when the P<193><207><195>avas later demanded their ç
kingdom back, as per the agreement, Duryodhana refused it, resulting ç
in the well-known Kuruk<218>etra war. Bh<200><218>ma was the first ç
commander- in-chief of the Kaurava army. Though he fought valiantly ç
he was ultimately downed by Arjuna. Since he had the special boon ç
of dying at will, he chose to live on†though badly wounded†for a period ç
of 58 days, till the uttar<193>ya<207>a or the period of the northern ç
solstice. At the behest of K<216><218><207>a, Bh<200><218>ma gave ç
a long discourse on the various aspects of dharma in answer to the ç
questions raised by Yudhi<218><219>hira. This section of the Mah<193>-bh<193>rata ç
known as the <185><193>ntiparva is an invaluable source of dharma ç
even now. He then gave up the body in yoga.

In temple rituals, the food offerings made to the deity through the ç

The icons of Vi<218><207>u are generally of four varieties: bhogam<220>rti, ç
yogam<220>rti, v<200>ram<220>rti  and  <193>bhic<193>rikam<220>rti.  They ç
respectively  concern  the  attitudes  of happiness,  meditation,  heroism  and ç
exorcism. Each one of these may again be sculptured in three possible ç
postures: sth<193>naka (standing), <193>s<200>na (seated) and ·ay<193>na ç
(recumbent). Further, each variety has three subdivisions: uttama ç
(superior), madhyama   (middling)   and   adhama (inferior).
The bhogam<220>rti of the sth<193>naka type, called `bhoga-sth<193>naka-m<220>rti', ç
has four hands. The two upper hands carry the cakra (discus) and ·a<209>kha ç
(conch). The right lower hands exhibits the gesture of abhaya  (protection)  or  varada  (boon- ç
giving). The left lower hand rests on the hip. The complexion is ·y<193>ma ç
or dark blue. <185>r<200>dev<200> (Lak<218>m<200>) and Bh<220>dev<200> ç
(Mother-earth) are shown as the consorts.
In the uttama variety, the deity is surrounded by several sages, celestial ç
beings and attendants. In the madhyama and the adhama versions, the ç
number ofthese subsidiary beings is gradually reduced.
In the bhogam<220>rti of the <193>s<200>na type called `bhog<193>sanam<220>rti', ç
the same description holds good. Vi<218><207>u is shown as seated ç
on a splendid throne. In rare cases, he may be shown as seated on ç
the Ananta or the thousand-hooded serpent.
In the bhogam<220>rti of the ·ay<193>na type, called `bhoga-·ay<193>na-m<220>rti', ç
the god is shown in a recumbent posture. One of the right hands supports ç
the head and one of the left hands is stretched till the thigh. The ç
·a<209>kha (conch) and the cakra (discus) may be shown in the other ç
two hands. Sometimes, they are shown independently, the two extra ç

@SPACE = 
One of the several aspects of <185>aivism is V<200>ra·aivism which ç
has a very large following in Karnataka. It calls the Divine as `sthala.'
Though this word means space, it is used in a more technical sense, ç
to indicate the omnipresent nature of the Divine.
This sthala bifurcates itself into `li<209>ga,' the personal God and ç
`a<209>ga,' the individual soul, also called j<200>va.
Both the li<209>ga and the a<209>ga undergo a threefold manifestation: ç
i<218><219>ali<209>ga, pr<193><207>a-li<209>ga and bh<193>vali<209>ga; ç
ty<193>g<193><209>ga, bhog<193><209>ga and yog<193><209>ga.
When the j<200>va renounces attachment to worldly objects, he is called ç
`ty<193>g<193><209>ga.' The i<218><219>ali<209>ga given to him by ç
his guru at the time of d<200>k<218><193> or initiation is the object ç
of his worship. When he gives up all casual pleasures and takes delight ç
only in what is conducive to spiritual growth, he is called bhog<193><209>ga ç
and the pr<193><207>ali<209>ga, <185>iva established in his heart, ç
becomes the object of his worship. On further progress in the inner ç
life, his old casual body is destroyed and a new state of consciousness ç
is formed. In this state the j<200>va is called yog<193><209>ga since ç
this leads him to yoga or union with <185>iva established in the sahasr<193>racakra, ç
the thousand petalled lotus situated in the crown of the head.

@NT = bhogya

It is common for a person in distress to pledge his property†whether ç
movable or immovable†with someone and borrow money. The dharma·<193>stras ç
or law-books of Hinduism call this as `<193>dhi.'
An object pledged thus is called `gopya' if it is just to be kept ç
in safe custody till the pledge is redeemed; or as `bhogya' if it ç
is permitted to be used or enjoyed.
The pledger loses his ownership over the object if he does not repay ç
the debt within the stipulated time. If there is no time limit, the ç
ownership is retained until the debt is repaid.
@NT = Bhoja
Bhojar<193>ja or the king Bhoja is a well-known figure in Sanskrit ç
literature. Belonging to the Param<193>ra dynasty of M<193><202>ava ç
(Malwa) he lived in the 11th century <F51320P10MSC1>A.D.<W1> Some scholars ç
assign him to the period <MS>A.D.<W1> 1010-1055. His capital was Dh<193>r<193>.
The number of works attributed to him is 34. They belong to a variety ç
of fields of knowledge that include astro-nomy, astrology, medicine ç
and surgery, grammar, economics and even engineering sciences. However, ç
it is more reasonable to believe that these works were written by ç
the variousscholars in his kingdom under his patronage.
At present, only the following five works have been found: Camp<220>-r<193>m<193>ya<207>a, ç
R<193>jam<193>rt<193><207><195>a, Tattvaprak<193>·a, Sarasvat<200>-ka<207><219>h<193>bh<193>ra<207>a ç
and <185><216><209>g<193>raprak<193>·a.
The second work, also called Bhoja-v<216>tti, is an independent ç
commentary on the Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali. It is brief ç
but lucid. The third work is on <185>aivism. Bhoja was a ·aiva by ç
faith. The last two deal with ala<209>k<193>ra or poetics and dramaturgy.
@NT = bhojana
@N1 = (`that which is eaten,' `food')
Every act of the Hindu, including those connected with his daily routine, ç
ispermeated by the spirit of religion. Bhojana or taking meal is ç
a very important part of such a daily routine.
According to Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad (6.5.4; 6.5.1; 6.7; 7.26.2) ç
body and mind are closely interconnected; and the food eaten by us ç
affects our mind. Since purity of food is conducive to the purity ç
of mind, great attention has to be paid to what we eat. This regulation ç
of food concerns four aspects: (1) quality; (2) quantity; (3) time ç
and (4) place.
The food should be conducive not only to health and strength but also ç
to purity of mind. Hence, food classified as s<193>ttvic (vide Bhagavadg<200>t<193> ç
17.7) should always be preferred.
As regards the quantity, it should be neither `too much,' nor `too ç
little.' Works on the °yurveda (the science of longevity or health) ç
prescribe that half the stomach is to be filled with solid food, a ç
quarter withliquid food or water, leaving the last quarter for the ç
circulation of wind or air. Whereas young brahmac<193>rins, who are ç
expected to do a lot of work and study in their gurukulas, are permitted ç
to eat sumptuously, the v<193>naprasthins (forest dwellers) and the ç
sa<221>ny<193>sins (monks) have to eat very limited quantities, as ç
much as is necessary to maintain general health and strength, necessary ç
for spiritual pursuits.
Coming to the time, the general rule is that one should eat only when ç
one is hungry. The time should also be adjusted to suit one's religious ç
practices, in a way that does not disturb their tenor. Consuming food ç
or drinks during the eclipses of the sun or the moon is strictly prohibited.
Concerning the place where food can be taken, physical cleanliness ç
and pleasing sights are strongly recommended. Eating in moving vehicles ç
or in a public place in full view of others has been prohibited. There ç
may have been compelling reasons during those times, when these rules ç
had been made, for such prohibition, though they are not possible ç
to observe now-a-days.
Since purity of food conduces to purity of mind, the dharma·<193>stras ç
have dealt with this subject rather in great detail.
Certain food articles like garlic and onion, are `j<193>tidu<218><219>a' ç
or defective by their very nature (j<193>ti = species, nature) and ç
hence unfit for consumption.
Others that get polluted due to the touch of unclean hands or animals, ç
(called `kriy<193>du<218><219>a') or belonging to the morally depraved ç
persons (called `parigraha-du<218><219>a') or from the houses of those ç
observing a·auca or ceremonial impurity (due to birth or death in ç
that house) are also prohibited.
In some of the works, it is stated that if one contemplates on the ç
act of eating as a yaj<210>a or sacrifice, he will reap great benefits ç
(vide Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad 5.19).
Facing east or north at the time of eating, observing silence during ç
eating and repeating the name of God in between two morsels, restricting ç
the food of the house-holder to two square meals per day, inscribing ç
certain religious symbols below the plate or the leaf used for food, ç
showing due respect to the food when it is brought for serving, keeping ç
away small quantities of food as bali or offering to Yama (the god ç
of death) and others†these are some of theinteresting side-lights ç
in these religious works, concerning bhojana.

@N1 = (`the commentary of Bhoja')
See <MS>BHOJA<D>.
@NT = bhokt<216>
@N1 = (`the enjoyer,' or `the experiencer')
The two words kart<216> or kart<193> (`the doer') and bhokt<216> or ç
bhokt<193> (`the enjoyer,' `the experiencer') are commonly used in ç
the Hindu philosophical works as applied to the j<200>v<193>tman (the ç
individual soul). Though the <193>tman (the Self or the soul) is ever ç
free, how he becomes bound as the j<200>v<193>tman due to association ç
with avidy<193> or aj<210><193>na (nescience) or prak<216>ti (nature) ç
is a question that can never be answered satisfactorily since our ç
mind which raises this question is itself the product of that nescience.
Once the existence of the j<200>v<193>tman which is a matter of our ç
common experience is conceded, its corollaries too can be accepted. ç
He is hence both the kart<216> and the bhokt<216> of actions. He experiences ç
the results of all actions done by him. It is thisfact of his being ç
a doer and the experiencer of actions and their fruits that results ç
in his bondage leading to rebirth.
Meditation on the <193>tman as his true Self, which is neither the ç
kart<216> nor the bhokt<216> will ultimately lead to mok<218>a or ç
liberation from transmigration.
@NT = bhrama
@N1 = (`that which is unsteady,' `error or illusion')
According to the Hindu philosophical works, knowledge is of two kinds: ç
pram<193> or true knowledge and bhrama or false knowledge.
Bhrama (also called `viparyaya'), sometimes described as `error' or ç
`illusion', may be caused by the defects in the perceptive system, ç
which includes the sense-organs as also the mind, or certain external ç
factors or even false logic.
@EMERGENCY = When one moon is seen as two or the conch as yellow in ç
colour, the defect lies in the sense-organs. If one infers the existence ç
of fire at a distance by mistaking the mist there for smoke, the error ç
is caused by an external factor. If some `scriptures' are accepted ç
as `true and authoritative' by a section of people, those opposed ç
to them attribute the `error' to `false logic.'
The oft-quoted examples for bhrama in the Ved<193>ntic texts are: ç
seeing a snake in a rope in insufficient light (rajjusarpa- ny<193>ya), ç
silver in nacre on a moonlit night (·ukti-rajata-ny<193>ya), water ç
in a mirage on a hot summer day (jala-mar<200>cik<193>-ny<193>ya) ç
or a person in a stump of tree (sth<193><207>u-puru<218>a-ny<193>ya).
@EMERGENCY = A detailed analysis of some of these examples†especially ç
the ·ukti-rajata- ny<193>ya†in order to determine the exact nature ç
of the error is a special feature of these texts.
@EMERGENCY = The word `bhrama' is sometimes used to denote a covered ç
arcade or an enclosed place of religious retirement meant formendicants, ç
generally attached to a temple.

@NT = bhrama-sa<221>sk<193>ras
@N1 = (`error impressions')
V<193>caspati Mi·ra (9th century <F51320P10MSC1>A.D.<F255P255DC255>) of the ç
Bh<193>mat<200> fame, a prominent teacher of Advaita Ved<193>nta ç
in the post-<185>a<209>kara period, refers to two kinds of avidy<193> ç
or nescience. The first is the psychological avidy<193> in the form ç
of `bhrama-sa<221>sk<193>ras' or error impressions; the second is ç
the primal, positive avidy<193>, which produces the beginningless ç
series of delusions and sa<221>sk<193>ras or impressions. The latter, ç
he calls `m<220>l<193>vidy<193>' or the `k<193>ra<207><193>vidy<193>' ç
(primal nescience), which produces the former which is `t<220>l<193>vidy<193>' ç
or `k<193>ry<193>vidy<193>' (derivative nescience).
@EMERGENCY = Bhramasa<221>sk<193>ras can be removed by the cognition ç
of the true or real objects whereas the m<220>l<193>vidy<193> can ç
be destroyed only by the realization of Brahman.

@NT = bhr<193>ntidar·ana
@N1 = (false perception)
@EMERGENCY = Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.C.<D>) in his well-known treatise, ç
the Yogas<220>tras, lists eight serious obstacles to yoga. Out of ç
these†technically called `antar<193>yas'†bhr<193>ntidar·ana or false ç
perception, is the seventh. It is a serious obstacle and requires ç
greater effort as also more tactful handling to prevent it or eliminate ç
it.
@EMERGENCY = At the intellectual level, false perception can manifest ç
itself as misunderstanding the teachings of the guru and the scriptures. ç
This can be due to dullness or perversion of the intellect or even ç
self-conceit. Discussions with the guru in all humility can help in ç
solving it.
False perception is possible at the psychic level also. Wrong methods ç
of practice can lead to hallucinations. They can be remedied by consulting ç
spiritually advanced souls.
True experience gives joy and peace whereas the false one may not ç
have any impact or may even cause unhappiness, fear, restlessness ç
and tension.
Psychic experiences like clairvoyance and clairaudience, though true ç
in themselves, can produce a false sense of self- realization thus ç
blocking further progress. They too come under `bhr<193>ntidar·ana.' ç
It needs great strength and wisdom to transcend the temptations of ç
such psychic powers as they often develop as a matter of course in ç
spiritual aspirants. Pata<210>jali himself gives the warning in the ç
s<220>tra 3.51.

@NT = Bhr<193>t<216>-dvit<200>y<193>
@N1 = (`second day devoted to brothers')
Festivals are part and parcel of popular religion in every society. ç
One ofthe comparatively minor festivals in Hinduism, generally tagged ç
on to the major festival D<200>p<193>val<200>, is Bhr<193>t<216>-dvit<200>y<193>, ç
also known as `Yama-dvit<200>y<193>'. It occurs on the second day ç
of the bright half of the month K<193>rttika (generally in November).
The legend goes that on this day, Yamun<193>, the river goddess, invited ç
her brother Yama (the god of Death) to her house and entertained him ç
with a feast to show her sisterly affection.
On this day sisters invite their brothers to their houses and feed ç
them sumptuously. Brothers on their part give them presents. It is ç
a day of joy of reunion of sisters and brothers who may be living, ç
after their marriage and establishing their own families, in distant ç
places.
Worship of Yama, the god of Death and of Citragupta, his chief lieutenant ç
are sometimes performed.
Worshipping  and  entertaining  an image made of flour or cowdung, ç
which represents a brother living in a far off place, is also observed ç
in some regions.
Persons living on the banks of the river Yamun<193> are expected to ç
bathe in the river on this day, before observing the rituals connected ç
with this festival.
Prayers are offered by the sisters for the long life and freedom from ç
dangers, of their brothers.
@NT = Bh<216>gu
@N1 = (`the roaster')
`Bh<216>gu' is a well-known name that appears in several works, both ç
Vedic and Paur<193><207>ic. Assuming that the word has been derived ç
from the root `bh<216>j' or `bhr<193>j' (`to burn or to roast') it ç
could have been the name of the fire-priest by whose magical power ç
the altar fire was kindled. According to a myth, god M<193>tari·van ç
brought lightning from the heavens to this earth and taught the art ç
of kindling fire with ara<207>is or fire-sticks, to the Bh<216>gus ç
(`bh<193>rgav<193><199>'), the °<207>girasas and the Atharvans.
The sage Bh<216>gu has been described as the m<193>nasaputra or mindborn ç
son of Brahm<193>, the Creator. Sometimes he has been stated to be ç
the son of god Varu<207>a or even of Indra. He was the father of Lak<218>m<200> ç
the spouse of Vi<218><207>u. (Hence the name `Bh<193>rgav<200>' has ç
been applied to her.) In other incarnations he was the father of <185>ukr<193>c<193>rya ç
(the guru of the asuras or demons) and of sages like Cyavana. He is ç
said to have once tested the Trinity†<|>Brahm<193>, Vi<218><207>u and ç
<185>iva†and come to the conclusion that Vi<218><207>u was the best ç
among them and that he alone deserved worship.
He is one of the well-known sages who were `gotra-pravartakas,' originators ç
of gotras or lineage. Hence his descendants are called `Bh<193>rgavas.' ç
Sages Jamadagni and Para·ur<193>ma belonged to this gotra.
The Mah<193>bh<193>rata pictures him as a great savant often delivering ç
discourses on abstruse matters.
He<|>was<|>one of the four sages†the other three being Mar<200>ci, Atri ç
and Ka·yapa †who elaborated the Vaikh<193>nasa °gama precepts followed ç
by some Vai<218><207>ava sects.
The place where Bh<216>gu is said to have performed austerities is ç
known as Bh<216>gu-Kaccha. It is situated on the bank of the river ç
Narmad<193> near its confluence with the sea. It is now known as Broach, ç
situated in the Gujarat State. At the place known as the Da·<193>·vamedha ç
Gh<193><219>, the king Bali is said to have performed the horse sacrifice. ç
It was here that he propitiated V<193>mana (the dwarf-incarnation ç
of Vi<218><207>u) and granted him the boon of `land covered in three ç
steps.' The city itself is considered to be very ancient, the original ç
`Bh<216>gupura' (city of Bh<216>gu) being built by Bh<216>gu himself.
@NT = Bh<216>gusa<221>hit<193>
@N1 = (`a collection [made by] Bh<216>gu')
Hindu astrology accepts and bases its calculations on the twelve r<193>·is ç
(signs of the Zodiac) and nine grahas or planets (including R<193>hu ç
and Ketu). There is a popular belief that a work called Bh<216>gu-sa<221>hit<193> ç
exists, in which the readings of allpossible horoscopes got by the ç
permutation and combination of these twelve r<193>·is and nine grahas ç
are given. By just referring to the particular horoscope given there ç
with ours, we can know everything about our past, present and future.
Some scholars have calculated that a complete Bh<216>gusa<221>hit<193> ç
would have to contain 7,46,49,000 horoscopes and at least ten times ç
this number, of ·lokas, assuming a minimum of ten ·lokas per horoscope.
The book itself has not been found. Here and there, some astrologers ç
claim to possess parts or the whole of the work which is hard to believe. ç

a voluminous work even in a big library.
@NT = Bh<216><209>gin
@N1 = (`One [who assumed the form of a bh<216><209>ga or a] beetle')
According to an account in the K<193>lik<193>pur<193><207>a (chapter ç
45) Bh<216><209>gin along with Mah<193>k<193>la, was a door keeper ç
at <185>iva's place as also a general of his troops. But other accounts ç
in the pur<193><207>as describe him as a sage who was devoted only ç
to <185>iva and looked down upon P<193>rvat<200>, <185>iva's spouse. ç
At P<193>rvat<200>'s request to `teach him a lesson' <185>iva assumed ç
the Ardhan<193>r<200>·vara form. When Bh<216><209>gin arrived at Kail<193>sa ç
to pay his obeisance to <185>iva which included pradak<218>i<207><193> ç
or circumambulation also, he is said to have become a `bh<216><209>ga' ç
or a beetle, and bored a hole in the middle so that he could go round ç
<185>iva only to the exclusion of P<193>rvat<200>! Hence the name ç
Bh<216><209>gin. When P<193>rvat<200> cursed him to become weak and ç
emaciated, <185>iva, outof compassion, endowed him with a third leg, ç
so that he could complete the circumambu-lation.
This story though it appears as funny, may symbolically represent ç
the attempts of uniting the <185>aiva and the <185><193>kta cults ç
whichmight have been at loggerheads at one time.
In iconographical representations Bh<216><209>gin is shown as a <216><218>i ç

P<193>pas (also called p<193>takas) or sins have been classified as ç

`Bhr<220><207>ahaty<193>' is one of the sins included in these lists.

The other dv<200>pas are: Plak<218>a, <185><193>lmala, Ku·a, Krau<210>ca, ç
<185><193>ka and Pu<218>kara. All these are surrounded by oceans containing ç
different kinds of liquids like water, milk, curds or cane juice.
Of these dv<200>pas, the Jamb<220>dv<200>pa is considered as more ç
relevant to us since the Bh<193>ratavar<218>a (the Indian land mass) ç
is situated in it.

@NT = Bh<220>man
@N1 = (`the Great one')
The Upani<218>ads are the main sources of the Ved<193>nta philosophy ç
which has gained a pre-eminent place, in Indian philosophy superseding ç
the other systems.
One of the most important subjects discussed by the Upani<218>ads ç
is Brahman, the Absolute, the origin and substratum of this created ç
universe.
Out of the several terms used in the Upani<218>ads to designate Brahman ç
the word `Bh<220>man' or `Bh<220>m<193>' is an uncommon one, used ç
only in the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad (7.23-25). Literally, it ç
means `that which is very big or great'.
N<193>rada, the well-known sage of the pur<193><207>as, approaches ç
Sanatkum<193>ra, the great teacher of his times, and begs him for ç
instruction regarding the °tman or the Self, the knowledge of which ç
alone can give freedom from sorrow.
Sanatkum<193>ra teaches him the techniques of a graded meditation, ç
the objects chosen for the same varying from n<193>ma or name up to ç
pr<193><207>a or the vital energy responsible for life. In this series ç
Bh<220>m<193>n comes last. When this Bh<220>man is experienced, one ç
attains supreme joy, compared to which all the pleasures of life pale ç
into insignificance.
This Bh<220>man is not only everywhere and in everything, it is also ç
our inner Self. One who realizes this becomes `svar<193><195>,' ruler ç
of his own self. He also attains the freedom to move in all the regions ç
of this universe.
This section of the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad is known as Bh<220>mavidy<193>.
@NT = Bh<220>s<220>kta
@N1 = (`hymn concerning<R>ç
Mother Earth')
It is the special characteristic of the ancient Hindu sages to see ç
the hand ofthe divine†nay, the divinity itself†in every object of ç
creation. Bh<220> or the earth being our basic abode that supports ç
and sustains us, is naturally looked upon as a goddess, the Mother ç
Divine, a consort of the Supreme Lord Himself.
According to the Vedas `<185>r<200>dev<200> (Lak<218>m<200>) and Bh<220>dev<200> ç
(Earth) are the spouses of Lord Vi<218><207>u (Puru<218>as<220>kta ç
24; Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> 1.5.3.12).
There are two Bh<220>s<220>ktas as available now: Atharvaveda Sa<221>hit<193> ç
12.1; Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> 1.5.3.
It is the latter s<220>kta that is more well-known. The first six ç
verses are from the Sa<221>hit<193>. The rest (12 verses) are considered ç
khila (addenda), but are also regularly chanted.
A brief summary of the s<220>kta may now be given:
Bh<220>dev<200>  pervades  all  the  three regions (earth, heaven ç
and sky). She affords an opportunity to the s<193>ttvik j<200>v<193>s ç
to realise God.
By circumambulating her, S<220>rya (the Sun-god) attained divinity.
It is through her grace that the Vedas have taken refuge in him (the ç
Sun-god).
It is again through her grace that the Sun-god has become the life-force ç
(pr<193><207>a) of this world of beings.
O Agni! Getting angry with you I forsook you! By your grace may I ç
be able to make you burn more brilliantly!
The anger of the Lord was absorbed by Bh<220>dev<200>.
She is the repository of all the gems. May she bless me with the power ç
of all sense-organs and grant me the light of Brahman.
She is the support or abode of (God) the Truth. She produces the best ç
of things. She is the support of all the living beings.
The sea is her garment. The mountains are her breasts.
She is the consort of Vi<218><207>u in his incarnation as Yaj<210>avar<193>ha ç
(the Boar). She is the ground for the performance of yaj<210>as or ç
sacrifices. She supports the river (Ga<209>g<193>) that dropped on ç
her from heaven.
She has the air for her breath and the ocean for her bed. She is specially ç
gracious to the spiritually blind persons.
I bow down to Bh<220>dev<200> who is also known as M<193>dhav<200>, ç
dear to M<193>dhava (Vi<218><207>u) as his wife and the dear co-wife ç
of Lak<218>m<200>.
I meditate upon Bh<220>dev<200> who is armed with the bow, for attaining ç
all that I want. May she inspire us for the same!
We offer oblations unto Bh<220>dev<200> who is the consort of Vi<218><207>u, ç
who is free from old age and who is sitting, facing her Lord.
Vi<218><207>u of great fame, measured the earth, the heaven and the ç
intervening space in three steps. Bh<220>dev<200>, the presiding deity ç
of the star <185>rava<207>a, takes refuge in him in order to grant ç
name and fame to her dependents.
May d<220>rv<193> (the panic grass), which represents the divine spirit, ç
which is superior to a thousand purifying agencies, which has hundreds ç
of nodes and sprouts and which destroys the effects of evil dreams, ç
remove all my impurities.
O Bh<220>dev<200>, who is traversed by a horse, a chariot and Vi<218><207>u, ç
I shall keep thee on my head! Protect me at every step! 
O Bh<220>dev<200>! You are the giver of happiness like the milch-cow. ç
You sustain life and support all living beings. You yourself were ç
raised by K<216><218><207>a in his incarnation as the Boar (Var<193>ha) ç
having a hundred hands.
O excellent Bh<220>dev<200>! Destroy my evil deeds and sins! Then ç
I can live for a hundred years. Mother Earth! Give me nourishment. ç
In you all are established.
I invoke the presence here of <185>r<200>, the goddess of prosperity, ç
who is verily Bh<220>dev<200> (or the earth) endowed with a peculiar ç
aroma, who is hard to damage, who is ever well-nourished, who has ç
an abundance of cattle and who is the ruler of all beings.
@NT = bh<220>ta
@N1 = (`that which is produced,' `that which has become')
One of the more widely used termsin the Indian philosophical systems, ç
the word `bh<220>ta' refers to the five fundamental ele- ments†pa<210>cabh<220>tas†viz., ç
p<216>thv<200><|>(earth), ap (water), tejas (fire), v<193>yu (air) ç
and <193>k<193>·a (ether), the permutations and combi-nations of which ç
result in this physical universe.<F14>
These bh<220>tas have two aspects, the primary and the secondary. ç
In the primary aspect they are `s<220>k<218>mabh<220>tas' or `tan-m<193>tras'. ç
They arise from the °tman associated with aj<210><193>na or nescience ç
and are called so since each one of them contains only that quality. ç
For instance, the primordial element <193>k<193>·a has only ·abda ç
(sound or vibration) as its characteristic and hence is called the ç
`·abda-tanm<193>tra'. The other primordial elements are: spar·a-tanm<193>tra ç
(v<193>yu or air), r<220>pa-tanm<193>tra (agni or fire), rasa-tanm<193>tra ç
(ap or water) and gandha-tanm<193>tra (p<216>thv<200> or earth).
When these five primordial elements combine among themselves by the ç
process of pa<210>c<200>kara<207>a or quintuplication (See <MS>PA<178>C®KARAØA<D> ç
for details.) they produce the secondary elements, the gross ones, ç
more commonly called the `mah<193>bh<220>tas or sth<220>labh<220>tas'. ç
Further creation takes place out of them, associated of course, with ç
the °tman.
The word bh<220>ta is also applied to all the living beings as a general ç
term.
Another meaning of the word is `spirits,ghosts and goblins,' belief ç
in whose existence was widespread. They are generally malignant, live ç
upon flesh, roam about mostly during the nights and haunt forests, ç
desolate houses and burial or cremation grounds.
Persons who meet with violent death or commit suicide or for whom ç
no obsequial rites are performed after death, are supposed to become ç
bh<220>tas or pretas or pi·<193>cas (disembodied spirits). Performing ç
such rites or prayers to God by the living, will help them to be liberated ç
from that miserable state.
The art and science of controlling these spirits and using them for ç
fulfilling one's desires or harming others, called `bh<220>tavidy<193>' ç
has been in existence since Vedic times.
One of the eight sections of °yurveda, the science of health and longevity, ç
is also designated as `Bh<220>tavidy<193>.' It deals with the treatment ç
of psychological ailments, believed to be caused by malevolent spirits.
@NT = bh<220>taga<207>a
@N1 = (`troupe of goblins')
Bh<220>tas are grotesque goblins who form part of the army of Rudra-<185>iva. ç
N<200>lalohita Rudra (one of the aspects of <185>iva) is said to have ç
created eleven crores of bh<220>tas. They are generally pictured as ç
lean figures with elongated ears eager to trouble others. They often ç
fought the asuras or demons siding with the gods.
Being the lord of these bh<220>tas, <185>iva is often called `Bh<220>tan<193>tha,' ç
`Bh<220>te·a' or `Bh<220>te·vara'. Ga<207>apati and Nandike·vara also ç
are sometimes called by this name.
@NT = bh<220>tajaya
@N1 = (`conquest of the elements')
The Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.C.<D>) is an accredited ç
work on the philosophy and practise of Yoga. The third chapter of ç
this work designated as Vibh<220>ti-p<193>da (the section dealing ç
with supernatural powers) gives an account of many yogic powers and ç
the means of attaining them. One such power mentioned there (3.44 ç
and 45) is `bh<220>tajaya.'
Bh<220>tas are the five elements: p<216>thv<200> or earth, ap or water, ç
tejas or fire, v<193>yuor air and <193>k<193>·a or ether. When a ç
yogipractises sa<221>yama on them, he conquers them.
Sa<221>yama is the technical name givento the trio of dh<193>ra<207><193> ç
(fixing the mind on the object of concentration), dhy<193>na (meditation) ç
and sam<193>dhi (superconscious revelation).
If sa<221>yama is achieved on the bh<220>ta p<216>thv<200> or earth, ç
he conquers it. As a result, the solidity of the earth will not be ç
an obstacle to his free movement. Similarly the conquest of the bh<220>ta ç
water gives himimmunity against wetness, of fire, immunity against ç
burning and so on.
@NT = bh<220>tam<193>t<193>
@N1 = (`Mother of beings')
Worship of God as the Mother is an ancient practice in Hinduism. One ç
of her innumerable aspects is `Bh<220>tam<193>t<193>' or the `Mother ç
of Beings'. Though she is consi-dered as the Mother of all the living ç
beings she is most probably the deity of less known or obscure cults ç
supposed to be worshipped by bh<220>tas (goblins), pretas and pi·<193>cas ç
(disembodied spirits) and minor godlings.
Iconographically she is shown as sitting under an a·vattha tree (Ficus ç
religiosa) on a splendid throne wearing ornaments of pearls. She ç
has two arms carrying a sword and a shield. Her complexion is pinkish ç
white.

@N1 = (`knowledge of the<R>ç
sounds of animals')
Man alone, among all the living beings, has had the privilege of being ç
endowed withthe power of speech, with which he can convey his thoughts ç
and feelings to others. However he has even been curious to know whether ç
animals, birds and even worms have their own means of communication. ç
Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) the ancient teacher of Yoga, asserts ç
in his famous work, the Yogas<220>tras (3.17), that a yogi can ç
acquire that extraordinary power by practising sa<221>yama (See <MS>BH<188>TAJAYA<D> ç
for an explanation of this word.) on the three separate aspects of ç
every word.
This can be illustrated with an example. When a person utters the ç
word `cow' we get the knowledge of a cow. However, on analysis, we ç
find that three things are involved in this. The word itself is a ç
sound produced by uttering the three letters c, o and w, in succession ç
by the vocal organs. The animal cow is a solid external object perceptible ç
to the eyes and the hands. The knowledge of it produced in the mind ç
is of the form of mental waves. Ordinarily, these three are mixed ç
up and yet, give us a unitive experience.
If the yogi can manage to separate these three in his mind and practise ç
sa<221>yama on each of them separately, then, he realizes the basic ç
truths underlying each of them, viz., ·abda (sound), artha (object ç
signified) and pratyaya (knowledge in the form of mental waves). This ç
will now empower him to `know' the meaning of all the sounds uttered ç
by all the living beings including those of the animal kingdom.
Pur<193><207>as sometimes mention the namesof persons who had acquired ç
this power.
@NT = bh<220>ta·uddhi
@N1 = (`purification of the<R>ç

P<220>j<193> or worship of a deity, whether in a temple or at home, ç
is an elaborate ritual. This p<220>j<193> can be based either on the ç
Vedic traditions or on the t<193>ntric.
One of the preliminary processes in a t<193>ntric p<220>j<193> is ç
`bh<220>ta·uddhi' or purification of the elements, making up the body ç
of the worshipper.
The worshipper has to raise his own self, the j<200>v<193>tman, first ç
to the feet of the Lord (Parama·iva or Param<193>tman) dwelling in ç
the sahasr<193>ra or thousand petalled lotus in the head. Then, uttering ç
the mantra ya<221>, has to imagine that the dross in his body has ç
dried up. This should be followed by the burning up this dross through ç
the mantra ra<221>. The drossless body is then to be bathed in ambrosia, ç
uttering the mantra va<221> and completely regenerated by the mantra ç
la<221>. This purified and regenerated body is now fit to worship ç
the Lord.
This whole process is called `bh<220>ta·uddhi.'
@NT = bh<220>tavidy<193>

Works on °yurveda (science of health and longevity) generally deal ç
with eight subjects, one of which is `bh<220>tavidy<193>.' It isthe ç
ancient equivalent of the modern psychiatry. Mental disorders, it ç
was believed, were caused by bh<220>tas or malevolent spirits. The ç
remedies recommended were prayers, oblations, exorcism as also some ç
drugs.
See also <MS>°YURVEDA<D>.
Bh<220>tavidy<193> is one of the nineteen branches of Knowledge (vidy<193>s) ç
mentioned in the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad (7.1.2). It is, perhaps, ç
the science and art of involving, inviting or controlling the goblins ç
and disembodied spirits.
Spirit worship was and is quite rampant in tribal and semitribal societies ç
of India.

@NT = bh<220>tayaj<210>a
@N1 = (`sacrifice unto the animals')
The Hindu scriptures emphasize that man is essentially a social being. ç
He is born in this world with <216><207>atraya or three debts on his ç
head, to discharge which, he has to perform pa<210>cayaj<210>as or ç
the five daily sacrifices. These pa<210>cayaj<210>as are a compulsory ç
part of a householder's life.
The last of these five daily sacrifices is bh<220>tayaj<210>a. Bh<220>tas ç
are living beings, especially the animals. Feeding the animals, both ç
the domestic and the stray, according to one's capacity comprises ç
this yaj<210>a. Since the Lord is the indwelling spirit of all the ç
living beings, feeding the hungry souls†whether the human beings or ç
the animals†will please him. This is one of the best ways to discharge ç
one's debts. It will also contribute to the awareness that ultimately ç
the whole universe is one and that we are part of that oneness.<F14>

@NT = bhuvana
@N1 = (`world')
Whether the world that we see here and now is the only one with living ç
beings or whether other such regions also exist elsewhere, has always ç
been a matter of inquisitiveness for man. The Hindu pur<193><207>as ç
have given accounts of such bhuvanas or lokas or worlds, though the ç
number of such worlds vary from one description to another.
Mostly it is three worlds that are mentioned, even in the Vedas: Bh<220>loka, ç
Antarik<218>a or Bhuvarloka and Svarloka or Svargaloka. If human beings ç
inhabit Bh<220>loka, the munis (sages) live in the Bhuvarloka whereas ç
the devas (gods) live in Svarloka or heaven.
Sometimes names of other lokas such as Pit<216>loka (the world of ç
manes), V<193>yuloka (the world of windgod) or Saptar<218>iloka (the ç
world of the Seven Sages) are also found mentioned in the pur<193><207>as.
Quite often, there is a reference to caturda·abhuvana or fourteen ç
worlds. They are: Bh<220>loka, Bhuvarloka, Svarloka, Maharloka, Janaloka, ç
Tapoloka and Satya-loka or Brahmaloka.
The six lokas above the Bh<220>loka are sometimes collectively called ç
`<188>rdhva-lokas,' since they are above this earth.
The other seven lokas, (making up a total of fourteen), and below ç
the earth, called the `Adholokas' or even as `P<193>t<193>las' are: ç
Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Tal<193>tala, Mah<193>tala, Ras<193>tala and ç
P<193>t<193>la.
The denizens of the <188>rdhvalokas are the beings at various stages ç
of higher spiritual evolution. Sinners of various categories inhabit ç
the lower worlds until their sins are exhausted by suffering.
All, except those in this Satyaloka or the Brahmaloka, have to return ç
to this earth for further evolution up to mok<218>a or liberation.

Acquisition of supernatural powers has always fascinated man right ç
from the beginning of human history. Some have struggled to get them ç
through witchcraft or sorcery or demonological rites, to harm or control ç
others through selfish or evil motives. Others however, while practising ç
spiritual disciplines to purify themselves have attained these powers ç
as a matter of course, as a part of that evolutionary process.

@NT = Bhuvane·vara
@N1 = ([the city of] the Lord of the world')
Bhuvaneswar, the modern capital of the State of Orissa (India), is ç
an ancient place of pilgrimage called `Bhuvane·vara' or `Ek<193>mrat<200>rtha' ç
in the pur<193><207>as. It is situated in the Khurda subdivision of ç
the Puri district and is 440 kms. (286 miles) from the city of Calcutta.
It was a great centre of <185>aivism in the Kali<209>gade·a (now Orissa) ç
and was often considered as a rival of V<193>r<193><207>as<200> (the ç
modern Banaras, the most celebrated of all the <185>aiva places of ç
pilgrimage). It was also a centre of Buddhism for some time, the remnants ç
of which can be found even now in the hills of Udayagiri and Kha<207><195>agiri.
Known as the city of seven thousand shrines, mostly surrounding the ç
famous Bindus<193>gara or Gos<193>gara lake, it now has hardly a hundred.
Though the city of Pur<200> (better known as Jagann<193>tha Pur<200> ç
or Jagann<193>tha-k<218>etra) is  now  much  more  well-known  and ç
resorted to, the tradition is that one who wishes to visit the latter ç
must first make a pilgrimage to the former. Even <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a ç
Caitanya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1485-1533) the great Vai<218><207>ava saint, ç
is said to have had the dar·an of Lord Li<209>gar<193>ja of Bhuvane·vara ç
first before proceeding to Pur<200>.<F51320P10W1C1>
A pilgrimage to Bhuvaneswar starts with a ceremonial bath and ·r<193>ddha ç
(obsequial offerings to the departed manes) at the Bindus<193>gar, ç
a lake measuring 420 by 330 metres (1400 ft. by 1100 ft.). It is believed ç
to have been dug out by Lord <185>iva himself to quench the thirst ç
of P<193>rvat<200>, his consort, a little water from all the sacred ç
rivers being drawn into it.
After worshipping Ga<207>apati, Gop<193>lin<200> (P<193>rvat<200> ç
as a cowherdess), Skanda and Nandi in the nearby shrines, the pilgrim ç
is advised to enter the temple of Li<209>gar<193>ja to offer his worship ç
there.
The great Li<209>gar<193>ja temple was built around <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1000. It is acclaimed as the finest example of a Hindu temple, of ç
the N<193>gara style, in eastern India. It stands amidst a cluster ç
of 65 smaller shrines in a spacious compound measuring about 160 by ç
140 metres (530 ft. by 460 ft.), the tower being nearly 55 metres ç
(180 ft.) high.<F51320P10W1C1>
The temple consists of the garbha-mandir, the sanctum sanctorum, ç
also called `<185>r<200>mandir' with a hollow vim<193>na (small tower) ç
over it. The image of <185>iva is a li<209>ga which is a huge uncarved ç
block of granite, about 2.4 metres (8 ft.) in diameter surrounded ç
by a rim of black chloride. The image itself is called as `Li<209>gar<193>ja,' ç
`Tribhuvane·vara' or `K<216>tti-v<193>sa'. Daily worship is done 22 ç
times, water, milk and bh<193><209>g (Indian hemp) being used to bathe ç
the li<209>ga.
The Bindus<193>gara is situated to the north of the temple.
Other temples situated in the vicinity are those of Ananta-V<193>sudeva, ç
R<193>ja-R<193><207>i, Mukte·vara, Para·ur<193>me·vara, Siddhe- ·vara ç
and Ked<193>re·vara. Out of these, the Mukte·vara temple, though small, ç
is considered to be very beautiful with elaborate carvings.
Situated at a distance of about 5kms. (3 miles) from Bhuvaneswar, ç
are the hills†Udayagiri, Kha<207><195>agiri and N<200>lagiri†containing ç
as many as 66 caves. There are many carvings in them, both Hindu and ç

Mahe·vara or <185>iva†with their consorts Sarasvat<200>, Lak<218>m<200> ç
and P<193>rvat<200>.
P<193>rvat<200>, also called <185>akti, forms the basis of the <185><193>kta ç
cult and has innumerable emanations or manifestations, widely worshipped ç
all over India.
One such celebrated aspect, quite commonly worshipped, is Bhuvane·var<200> ç
or `Mistress of the universe'. She is worshipped not only in the Dev<200> ç
temples but also in one's own home.
She is sometimes classed among the Da·amah<193>vidy<193>s, ten aspects ç
of transcendental knowledge and power. (See <MS>DA<185>A- MAH°VIDY°S<D>.) ç
She is the ruler over the caturda·abhuvanas or the fourteen worlds ç
from Brahmaloka to P<193>t<193>la; hence the name Bhuvane·var<200>. ç
She is the presiding deity over all the forces of the material world, ç
which can be obtained by propitiating her.
Iconographically, she is represented as of the colour of the rising ç
sun. Extraordinarily beautiful, she is seated on a lotus seat, has ç
three eyes and four arms, and is bedecked with an array of ornaments. ç
A crescent moon adorns her crown. She is holding a p<193>·a (noose) ç
and an a<209>ku·a (goad) in two hands, the other two hands exhibiting ç
the varada (boon-giving) and abhaya (protection) mudr<193>s.
@NT = Bh<220>var<193>ha
Out of the ten avat<193>ras (known as Da·<193>vat<193>ras) or incarnations ç
of Vi<218><207>u, the Var<193>ha (Boar-incarnation) is the third. ç
Vi<218><207>u assumed this form to recover bh<220> or the earth†deified ç
as Bh<220>dev<200> or Earth- goddess†sunk in the waters of the ocean ç
by the demon Hira<207>y<193>k<218>a.
He is generally shown as lifting up and holding Bh<220>dev<200> in ç
his right hand. The goddess herself is shown as a charming damsel ç
of dark complexion (or bright like lightning) with folded hands.
Bh<220>var<193>ha is sometimes distinguished from °divar<193>ha, the ç
latter being shown  as  standing  on  the  °di·e<218>a (Serpent-Conch ç
Vi<218><207>u) whereas the former isnot. Occasionally the two forms ç
are shown as identical.

According to the Hindu pur<193><207>as there are fourteen lokas or ç
worlds in this universe,  generally  called  Caturda·a- bhuvanas.
Of these, six lokas are above the earth (Bh<220>loka) and seven below ç
it.
Bhuvarloka is the first in this series, above the earth. It occupies ç
the space between the earth and the sun. It is inhabited by munis ç
(sages) and siddhas (perfected beings).
@NT = b<200>ja
@N1 = (`the seed')
Though the word means the seed of any plant or a tree, it has been ç
used in a more fundamental sense as the origin or the cause of anything. ç
As the cause of life it means the semen of living beings. As thecause ç
of sa<221>s<193>ra or transmigratory existence, it represents avidy<193> ç
or aj<210><193>na (nescience). In dramaturgy it stands for a root-cause ç
out of which the whole play ultimately evolves. In Ha<219>hayoga, ç
it is a kind of mudr<193> or pose of hand and figures with a mystic ç

@N1 = (`seed-mantra')
The use of mantras or mystic syllables or formulae, as an aid to up<193>san<193> ç
or meditation is wide-spread in Hinduism. Though Brahman, the ultimate ç
Truth orthe Absolute is one and one only, its manifestations however, ç
can be innume-rable. As is declared in the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> ç
(4.11; 7.21) God responds to the prayers of his devotees in and through ç
any form the devotee chooses. Over the millennia, the <216><218>is ç
of the Vedas, the pur<193><207>as and the tantras (secondary scriptures) ç
of the various cults have given us a large number of deities, both ç
male and female, for our up<193>san<193> and spiritual upliftment. ç
If it is remembered thatall these deities, though with different ç
names and forms, are, all the same, the various manifestations of ç
thatGod†like the chocolate dolls being chocolate only and hence all ç
tasting sweet †there can be no confusion or conflict in the minds ç
of the votaries.
Every deity has a tantra or a philo-sophy and associated rituals, ç
a yantra or a geometrical form and a mantra or a sound-form. The physical ç
form of the deity is described in its dhy<193>na·loka (hymn of meditation) ç
which is of great help in actual meditation.
The mantras are of various types, the most common form being the one ç
having three or four parts: pra<207>ava or O<221>, the b<200>j<193>k<218>ara ç
or the b<200>j<193>mantra, the name of the deity in the caturth<200>-vibhakti ç
or dative case and the word nama<199> indicating obeisance. For eg., ç
consider the well-known mantra of <185>iva†O<221> nama·-·iv<193>ya, ç
(`Om, obeisance to <185>iva!') Here, of course, the b<200>j<193>k<218>ara, ç
the seed-letter, is missing.
The b<200>jamantra, which is generally monosyllabic and hence called ç
`bij<193>k<218>ara' (ak<218>ara = letter) also, is, as its very name ç
indicates, a `seed-formula,' containing the essence of the deity in ç
itself. This will gradually get evolved by an assiduous practice of ç
its repetition with faith and devotion, even as the tree evolves out ç
of its seed by proper cultivation. Hence the aptness of the term `b<200>ja' ç
to it.
@SPACE1 = 
Every  deity,  even  the  different aspects of the same deity, have ç
different b<200>jamantras which are kept a secret, to be handed down ç
in the oral tradition from the guru to the disciple at the time of ç
d<200>k<218><193> or initiation into spiritual life.
Some of the more common b<200>ja- mantras are: hau<221> (for <185>iva), ç
du<221> (for Durg<193>), kr<200><221> (for K<193>l<200>), ·r<200><221> ç

The bilva tree (Aegle marmelos), commonly called as the bel tree ç
or the wood-apple tree, has long been considered as very sacred. Known ç
as <185>r<200>phala or <185>r<200>v<216>k<218>a in the Sanskrit works, ç
it is said to be dear to <185>iva, whose vegetal form it is supposed ç
to be, to P<193>rvat<200> or <185>akti and to <185>r<200> or Lak<218>m<200>. ç
Worship to this tree is an integral part of the elaborate Durg<193>p<220>j<193> ç
ritual.
Its leaves are invariably used in the worship of <185>iva and <185>akti. ç
Amulets prepared out of these leaves are believed to be endowed with ç
supernatural powers.
Medicines prepared out of the unripe fruit are credited with very ç
effective powers of cure.
A pledge taken over the bilva leaf is considered too sacred to be ç
broken.
`Bilva' is also the name of one of the mudr<193>s or poses of hand ç
and fingers, generally used in the worship of Vi<218><207>u.

@NT = bindu
@N1 = (`dot' or `point')
According to the <185><193>kta-tantras, scriptures of the cult of ç
the Divine Mother,the ultimate Reality is one, a transcendental Absolute. ç
It is immutable and ineffable. It is pictured as prak<193>·a, supreme ç
effulgence. Desiring to become many, this Absolute starts reflecting ç
on itself. This deliberation is technically designated as `vimar·a'. ç
This vimar·a creates a throb or stir, spanda, which develops as vibration ç
or n<193>da, and gets concentrated to a point or bindu. This bindu, ç
like a dicotyledonous seed, contains the <185>iva-<185>akti principle ç
as one closely knit unit. It then gradually evolves into this universe.
Anusv<193>ra, the dot placed above the letters of the Sanskrit alphabets, ç
indicating the nasal sound, is also called `bindu'. It is an invariable ç
part of the b<200>jamantras and is said to impart an additional meaning ç
of dispelling sorrow.
In the works on yoga, bindu stands for the <193>j<210><193>cakra, ç
the psychic centre between the eyebrows.

Taking bath in sacred rivers has been considered as a highly meritorious ç
act since the ancient days. The Ga<209>g<193> at V<193>r<193><207>as<200> ç
(Banaras) is one such sacred river. On the banks of this sacred river, ç
several bathing places have been provided, with steps leading from ç
the bank right up to the water. They are called `gh<193><219>s'.
The Pa<210>caga<209>g<193>-gh<193><219> is one of the five gh<193><219>s. ç
Here, four rivers†Kira<207><193>, Sarasvat<200>, Yamun<193> and Dh<220>tap<193>p<193>†are ç
believed to join the Ga<209>g<193> in their subtle forms, unseen by ç
the naked eye. Hence the name Pa<210>caga<209>g<193> or five Ga<209>g<193>s ç
or sacred rivers.
One of the temples situated at this gh<193><219> is a small Vi<218><207>u ç
temple, without the·ikhara or tower. A small image of dark colour ç
is established on a large si<221>h<193>sanaor throne. The deity is ç
called Bindu-m<193>dhava.
The story goes that once Lord Vi<218><207>u visited V<193>r<193><207><193>s<200> ç
and sat down at the Pa<210>caga<209>g<193>-gh<193><219> since he liked ç
it much. A br<193>hma<207>a, Agnibindu by name, who was practising ç
severe austerities there, recognized the Lord and prayed to him with ç
a long devotional hymn. Pleased with it, the Lord granted his wish ç
which was twofold. The Lord had to stay there permanently and his ç
image should be known as Bindu-m<193>dhava, thus perpetuating the ç
name of the br<193>hma<207>a. The sacred water of the river at this ç
gh<193><219> came to be known as Bindut<200>rtha.
@NT = Bindusaras
@N1 = (`lake of drops of water')
Places associated with gods or saints or saintly kings or other holy ç
persons have been the favourite pilgrim resorts of the Hindus over ç
the centuries. One of the less known places of pilgrimage is the lake ç
Bindusaras, also known as the Bindu-sarovara.
The Mah<193>bh<193>rata (Bh<200><218>maparva 6.43-46) describes ç
a Bindusaras as situated between the mountains Main<193>ka and Hira<207>ya·<216><209>ga. ç
It is here that the king Bhag<200>ratha practised severe austerities ç
to bring the river Ga<209>g<193> from the world of gods to the world ç
of men. The place, even now known by the same name, is situated near ç
Ga<209>gotri (birthplace of the river Ga<209>g<193>) about 3 kms. ç
(2 miles) to the south. A small temple dedicated to the river goddess ç
Ga<209>g<193> stands at the place where Bhag<200>ratha is said to ç
have practised austerities.
When  the  river  goddess  Ga<209>g<193> acceded to Bhag<200>ratha's ç
request to descend to this earth, <185>iva arrested her ferocious ç
flow with his matted hair and then let the water out in drops which ç
formed this Bindusaras (bindu = drop). The river Ga<209>g<193> then ç
emerged out of this in seven streams.
The lake Kap<193>lamocana-t<200>rtha at V<193>r<193><207>as<200> or ç
K<193>·<200> (modern Banaras), where <185>iva is said to have bathed ç
and got rid off the sin of decapitating one of the five original heads ç
of Brahm<193>, is also sometimes called Bindusaras.
The Brahmapur<193><207>a (41.52-54) des-cribes one Bindusaras created ç
by Rudra (<185>iva) by collecting drops of water from all the holy ç
places and filling the lake with that. It is said to be situated in ç
the Ek<193>mraka-k<218>etra.

Durg<193>p<220>j<193>, worship of the Divine Mother Durg<193>, celebrated ç
for nine days or for three days, during the month of °·vayuja or °·vina ç
(September/October), is a major festival of the Hindus.
According to Hindu mythology, the various gods and goddesses go to ç
sleep for a period of four months (from °<218><193><195>ha to K<193>rtt<200>ka, ç
July to October). Since the Durg<193>p<220>j<193> is celebrated in ç
the month of °·vina when Durg<193> is still asleep, she has to be ç
woken up first. This ceremonial waking up of the deity is called `bodhana.' ç
It is done on the evening of °·vina ·ukla <218>a<218><219>h<200>, ç
(sixth day of the bright fortnight of the month of °·vina). A gha<219>a ç
or kala·a (a pot with water containing sandalwood paste, d<220>rv<193> ç
grass, leaves of five trees like mango, clay from seven places, fruit ç
etc.) is established under a bilva tree (Aegle marmelos), the mantras ç
of bodhana or awakening are uttered, and the bilva tree itself is ç
worshipped as the Mother Durg<193>.
The story goes that when Durg<193> (P<193>rvat<200>, the spouse of ç
<185>iva) came to her mother's house from her husband's home, it was ç
late in the evening. So, she decided not to disturb her parents and ç
spent the whole night under a bilva tree near the house. The ritual ç
described above, is symbolic of this.
Bodhana is also one of the ten aspects of a ritual aimed at making ç
a mantra (divine formula) potent. See <MS>MANTRA- SA<189>SK°RA<D> ç

on the Brahma-s<220>tras written by an ancient teacher Bodh<193>yana, ç
which was quite voluminous and which he (R<193>m<193>nuja) had faithfully ç

who again, had been known as K<216>tako<219>i and Halabh<220>ti also. ç
He is saidto have written a v<216>tti on the P<220>rvam<200>m<193><221>s<193>-s<220>tras ç
also. However none of these has been universally accepted by the scholars ç

Bodh-gay<193> or Buddha-gay<193> is one of the most holy places of ç

Gautama attained `bodhi' or spiritual enlightenment and became the ç
Buddha.
This place is situated at a distance of ten kilometers (6.5 miles) ç
from Gay<193>, the well-known place of Hindu pilgrimage. The chief ç
attractions of this place are the peepul tree (Bodhi tree) (See <MS>BODHIV<184>K<186>A ç
<D>for details.) and the Buddha temple. The temple is 15 metres (50 ç
ft.) square and the total height is 48 metres (160 ft.). There is ç
a beautiful image of Buddha as also of M<193>y<193>dev<200> (Buddha's ç
mother). Though tradition ascribes the building of this temple to ç
A·oka (272-232 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>), the present one may have been built ç

its roots in the ancient scriptures, adds another important deity, ç
Brahm<193>. The three†Brahm<193>, Vi<218><207>u and <185>iva† together ç
form the Hindu Trinity.
Brahm<193> creates the world, Vi<218><207>u sustains it and <185>iva ç
destroys it. This process of creation (s<216><218><219>i), preservation ç
(sthiti) and destruction (pralaya) continues perpetually in that order.
Thus Brahm<193> is the source, the seed, of all that is. He is, as ç
his very name indicates, boundless immensity, from which space, time ç
and causation originate, names and forms spring up. Philosophically, ç
he is the first stage of manifestation of the notion of individual ç
existence (aha<209>k<193>ra). Theologically, he is the uncreated Creator ç
(Svayambh<220>), the self-born first Person.

He has several designations which are as instructive as they are interesting. ç
From the cosmological point of view, he is the Golden Embryo (Hira<207>yagarbha), ç
the ball of fire, from which the universe develops. Since all created ç
beings are his progeny, he is Praj<193>pati, the Lord of progeny,  as  also  the  Pit<193>maha,  the ç
Patriarch. He is Vidhi, the ordinator, Loke·a, the master of the worlds, ç
as well as Dh<193>t<216>, the sustainer. He is also Vi·vakarm<193>, ç
the architect of the world.
Hindu mythological literature des-cribes Brahm<193> as having sprung ç
from the lotus originating from the navel of Vi<218><207>u. Hence ç
he is called N<193>bhija (the navel-born), Ka<210>ja (waterborn) and ç
so on.
