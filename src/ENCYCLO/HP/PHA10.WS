@NT = p<220>r<207><193>huti
@N1 = (`[the final] offering which completes [the sacrifice]')
In Vedic sacrifices the word means offering a ladle-full of ghee into ç
the fire. The final offering is made by the priest, in the standing ç
posture. This is then followed by the yajam<193>na or sacrificer giving ç
gifts to the priests.
In many other homas, performed according to the <193>gamas and the ç
tantras, p<220>r<207><193>huti represents the final offering (with ç
appropriate mantras) indicating the completion of the rite. In such ç
<193>hutis, the materials used are cloth, coconut, flowers, t<193>mb<220>la ç
(arecanuts and betel leaves), all of them being soaked in ghee.
@NT = p<220>r<207>akumbha
@N1 = (`pot filled [with water]')
A p<220>r<207>akumbha is a sacred symbol of prosperity. Other names ç
for the same are: p<220>r<207>agha<219>a and p<220>r<207>akala·a.
It is a part and parcel of many rituals since it indicates auspiciousness.
It is prepared by filling up a pot of silver or copper with water, ç
to which may be added certain scents, and the mouth covered with mango ç
leaves and a coconut.

When an important guest or an invitee for a sacred function arrives, ç
he is to be received with p<220>r<207>akumbha accompanied by the chanting ç
of Vedic mantras that generally include the ·<193>ntimantras and selected ç
portions from the Upani<218>ads.
Sculptural representations of p<220>r<207>a-kumbha are frequently ç
seen in temples from very early times. They are shown on walls and ç
pillars in a variety of decorative arrangements.
@NT = p<220>r<207>ap<193>tra
@N1 = (`a vessel which is full')
In Vedic sacrifices like Dar·ap<220>r<207>a-m<193>sa, it refers to ç
a vessel, full of water, from which the priest adhvaryu pours water ç
into the joined hands of the wife (of the yajam<193>na or the sacrificer) ç
who is holding the yoktra (cord <|>of <|>mu<210>ja <|>grass used as a ç
belt) in them. A mantra from the Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> (1.1.10.2) ç
has to be chanted at that time.
At the end of a homa performed as per the tantras (<185><193>kt<193>gamas) ç
a p<220>r<207>ap<193>tra has to be gifted. This is called `p<220>r<207>a-p<193>trad<193>na'. ç
It consists of keeping in a plate all the ingredients needed for a ç
full meal†like uncooked rice, gram, ghee, oil, salt, fruits and sweets ç
along with a coin as dak<218>i<207><193> or cash-gift†and give it ç
to a br<193>hma<207>a after the homa.
As a substitute for such a p<220>r<207>ap<193>tra, one can offer a ç
vessel of sufficient quantity of rice (enough for a single meal), ç
some fruits and a coin.
Before giving it away, it has to be sanctified with appropriate mantras.

The offerings made into the fires in various Vedic sacrifices are ç
of different types. The puro<195><193>·a is one such, which is very ç
common in the Dar·a, Somay<193>gas and Pa·uy<193>gas.
It is actually a cake made of pounded rice or barley flour, baked ç
on the g<193>rhapatya fire on kap<193>las or potsherds, gene-rally ç
8 or 11 in number.
These puro<195><193>·as must be shaped like a tortoise.
They are offered to the deities like Indra, P<220><218>an, Sarasvat<200>, ç
Mitra and Varu<207>a.
The detailed process involved in their preparation is given in the ç
<185>rautas<220>tras of °pastamba (1.24.6) and K<193>ty<193>yana ç
(2.6.49).
@NT = purohita
@N1 = (`one who is engaged in rites that give their fruits here and ç
hereafter')
Right from the most ancient days, the Hindu sages had recognised the ç
needfor a king or a ruler to protect and control the society. Similarly ç
they had also recognised the need for the king to be guided by a purohita ç
(chaplain of the State), not only in matters of religion but also ç
in other fields like the dispensing of justice. Their philosophy behind ç
statecraft was that only a balanced combination of the kingly and ç
the priestly powers could guarantee the complete well-being of the ç
State.
A king was to select a purohita endowed with the following qualities: ç
He should be a br<193>hma<207>a from a good family, possessing great ç
learning, eloquence and pure character. He must be a handsome person ç
of middle age. He should also be well-versed in the science of portents, ç
and, the rites to be performed to offset the evil effects indicated ç
by the portents.
His position was often hereditary; hence the term `kulapurohita'.
(Incidentally, even the devas or the gods and the asuras or the demons ç
are said to have had kulapurohitas! The names of B<216>haspati and ç
<185>ukr<193>c<193>rya are often mentioned in the Vedas and the pur<193><207>as ç
as the two kulapurohitas of these two races.)
His status was considered as even superior to that of the mantrins ç
or the ministers.
If and when a king wanted to perform a Vedic sacrifice, the advice ç
of the purohita was of supreme importance in selecting the <216>tivks ç
(priests).
Even in the modern days, the Hindu society very much depends on the ç
purohita or the priest for the performance of religious rites whether ç
at home or in temples or in public/social functions. Some of these ç
rites are: performance of the sa<221>sk<193>ras (sacraments) like ç
upanayana (thread-ceremony) viv<193>ha (marriage) and ·r<193>ddha ç
(obsequial ceremonies); all ceremonies connected with the temple worship; ç
religious rites like homa performed for the good of the society.
Though these ceremonies include Vedic mantras, they are based more ç
on the <193>gamas and pur<193><207>as.

@NT = P<220>ru
P<220>ru was a prince of the lunar race held up as an ideal of a devoted ç
son. He was the youngest son of the king Yay<193>ti and <185>armi<218><219>h<193>.
Even when Yay<193>ti grew old, his desire for sense-pleasures had ç
not abated. Hence he requested his four sons one by one, to exchange ç
their youth with his old-age. Only P<220>ru, the last son obliged. ç
Yay<193>ti then crowned him as the king and left for the pursuit of ç
pleasures.
However, after a long time, Yay<193>ti discovered to his dismay, that ç
desires (especially lust) grow in intensity rather than decrease, ç
by enjoyment, even as fire blazes forth more and more as ghee is poured ç
into it.
This story appears in several pur<193><207>as. The one in the °diparva ç
(83 and 84) of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata may be the earliest.
@NT = Purukutsa
Purukutsa was the son of the famous king M<193>ndh<193>t<216> of the ç
solar race. He was a forefather of <185>r<200> R<193>ma. He had married ç
Narmad<193>, a princess of the N<193>ga tribe. His grandson, Anara<207>ya, ç
at the time of his death in a duel with R<193>va<207>a, cursed him ç
that he would be killed by <185>r<200> R<193>ma, a descendant of the ç
Ik<218>v<193>ku (or Solar) race.
The <184>gveda (1.63.7) mentions one Purukutsa who was saved by ç
Indra. He was a sage.
@NT = Pur<220>ravas
Pur<220>ravas was a heroic king mentioned even in the <184>gveda ç
(10.95) wherein a curious dialogue between him and <188>rva·<200> ç
an apsaras or nymph has been recorded. This oldest love-story of the ç
two has been repeated in other sections of the Vedas like the <185>atapatha ç
Br<193>hma<207>a (11.5.1.1) also.
He was the son of Budha and I<202><193>.
The Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a (4.6) contains a detailed version ç
of the same story. The drama Vikramorva·<200>ya of K<193>lid<193>sa ç
(200 <MS>B.C.<D>) is based on it with several variations.
<188>rva·<200>, the divine damsel, was once banished to this earth ç
wherein she fell in love with the king Pur<220>ravas and married him, ç
laying certain conditions. After a few years, it so happened that ç
the king was once forced to violate the conditions†by a stratagem ç
of the gods in heaven† whereby <188>rva·<200> left him. All his efforts ç
to get her back were in vain.
@NT = puru<218>a
@N1 = (`[one who] sleeps in the city [of nine gates or the body]')
In common usage, the word `puru<218>a' means a man.
A good man should have these five qualities: giving gifts to deserving ç
persons; appreciating the good in others; feeling happy in the company ç
of relatives andfriends; erudition in the scriptures; capacity to ç
fight for a righteous cause.
He should also have great self-control.
In the Upani<218>ads the word has often been used to indicate the ç
j<200>va (the Self) as also the Param<193>tman (the Supreme Soul or ç
God).
The S<193><209>khya philosophy uses it as a technical term indicating ç
the individual soul. In Sanskrit grammar it is used to denote the ç
first, the second and the third persons.
@NT = Puru<218>amedha
@N1 = (`human-sacrifice')
Human sacrifice†however detestable it is†has existed in many ancient ç
countries and cultures, including the Semitic (Arabian, Babylonian, ç
Hebrew and Egyptian), the Celtic (Indo-European), the Chinese, the ç
Greek, the Iranian, the Japanese and the Korean. The word `Puru<218>amedha' ç
means a sacrifice in which a human being is also one of the `animals' ç
to be immolated. It is stated to be a Somay<193>ga of five days' duration. ç
The <185>rautas<220>tras of °pastamba (20.24-25) and Bodh<193>yana ç
(24.11) deal with it.
The story of <185>una··epha as it occurs in the Aitareya Br<193>hma<207>a ç
(33.5) and referred to even in the <184>gveda (1.24.12 and 13; 5.2.7) ç
raises the suspicion that such a sacrifice might have been existing ç
in the most ancient period.
However, even by the time of the <185>atapatha Br<193>hma<207>a ç
(vide 13.6) sacrifice of human beings, whether in Puru<218>a-medha,  A·vamedha  or  R<193>jas<220>ya,  had ç
already become symbolical. After the usual rites, the human being ç
(or beings) would be let off.
The pur<193><207>as and the tantras refer to another type, called ç
`narabali,' wherein human beings were sacrificed to appease the fierce ç
goddess K<193>l<200>. This practice has somehow survived even to this ç
day, especi-ally among the aboriginal tribes, though getting more ç
and more rare.
@NT = puru<218><193>rthas
@N1 = (`ends [to be striven for by] human beings')
Recognising the basic needs and cravings of a human being, the ancient ç
sages of Hinduism have given a fourfold ideal to be striven for, by ç
everyone. This is called the puru<218><193>rthas or the ends to be ç
striven for in life.
They are four: dharma (righteousness), artha (wealth), k<193>ma (desires ç
of theflesh) and mok<218>a (liberation from transmigratory existence).
Ordinary enjoyments of the world are centred round artha and k<193>ma. ç
However, in this world of cut-throat competition, unless some higher ç
norms and standards† the right rules for a good and a fair game †are ç
set up, the big fish will eat up the smaller ones and the jungle-law ç
will prevail.
It is these rules that are indicated by the omnibus term dharma.
Every person is free to pursue the path of artha and k<193>ma, comfort ç
and pleasure, but always within the perimeters of dharma.
However, life teaches everyone, at least the more cultured and refined ç
ones, that neither artha nor k<193>ma can ever be satiated; and, that ç
there must be a much higher goal to be sought after. This ismok<218>a ç
or total liberation from the transmigratory cycle of birth and death, ç
and, being reinstated in one's original state, the state of eternal ç
bliss.
This can be attained through spiritual evolution under the guidance ç
of expert spiritual masters.
Sometimes, the first three are grouped as one unit called `trivarga' ç
and the last as `apavarga' (`that which is beyond the three').
@SPACE1 = 
As applied to a king, the four puru<218><193>rthas recommended are: ç
desire for wealth that he does not have; protecting the wealth that ç
he already has; developing and increasing that wealth; and, using ç
it according to dharma (vide Manusm<216>ti 7.99).
Here, the word `artha' (in `puru-·<193>rtha') is taken only as `wealth'.

@SPACE = 
The Puru<218>as<220>kta has been one of the most commonly used Vedic ç
hymns in almost all rituals or religious ceremonies. Whether it is ç
the worship of the deity (either in a temple or in one's own home) ç
or the daily recitation of religious scriptures or Vedic rites establishing ç
the sacred fire or even the cremation of the body of a dead br<193>hma<207>a, ç
this S<220>kta invariably finds a place.
A well-known ancient text, the <184>gvidh<193>na of <185>aunaka, ç
deals with its usage (viniyoga), the fruits it can give (phala·ruti) ç
as also its greatness and importance (m<193>h<193>tmya). For instance, ç
a couple desirous of begetting a worthy son is advised to perform ç
worship and homa (ceremonial oblations into the duly consecrated fire) ç
with the first sixteen mantras of this S<220>kta. It can also be ç
utilised in <218>o<195>a·opac<193>ra-p<220>j<193> (worship with 16 ç
items) to <185>r<200>hari or Vi<218><207>u.
The hymn can be used for meditation too, on N<193>r<193>ya<207>a.
The Puru<218>as<220>kta is an integral part of the <184>gveda Sa<221>hit<193> ç
(10.7.90.1-16). It also appears in the Taittir<200>ya °ra<207>yaka ç
(3.12,13), the V<193>jasaney<200> Sa<221>hit<193> (31.1-6), the ç
S<193>maveda Sa<221>hit<193> (6.4) and also the Atharvaveda Sa<221>hit<193> ç
(19.6). Apart from this, an explanation of some parts of this hymn ç
is also found in the <185>atapatha Br<193>hma<207>a, the Taittir<200>ya ç
Br<193>hma<207>a andthe <185>vet<193>·vatara Upani<218>ad. The ç
Mudgalopani<218>ad gives a nice summary of the entire Puru<218>as<220>kta. ç
The contents of the S<220>kta have largely been reflected in the ç
Bh<193>gavata (2.5.35<+>to<+>2.6.1-29) and in the Mah<193>bh<193>rata ç
(Mok<218>adharma Parva 351 and 352) also.
The text as is now most commonly used has 24 mantras or stanzas. It ç
appears in the Taittir<200>ya °ra<207>yaka as stated above.The ç
first 18 mantras are designated as the P<220>rvan<193>r<193>ya<207>a ç
and the rest as the Uttaran<193>r<193>ya<207>a. Sometimes6 more ç
mantras are added. This part is called Vai<218><207>av<193>nuv<193>ka ç
since it has been taken from another well-known hymn, the Vi<218><207>us<220>kta, ç
a part of the <184>gveda Sa<221>hit<193>. Though the mantras of ç
the Uttara-n<193>r<193>ya<207>a and the Vai<218><207>av<193>nuv<193>ka ç
do not seem to have any coherence with the 16 mantras of the <184>gveda ç
Sa<221>hit<193>, tradition has somehow clubbed them together.
There is some perceptible difference in the order of the mantras as ç
found in the extant texts of the <184>gveda Sa<221>hit<193> and ç
the Taittir<200>ya °ra<207>yaka of the Yajurveda. The first 6 ç
mantras are identical. The 7th mantra of the Yajurveda (sapt<193>sy<193>san ç
paridhaya<199>) is the 15th in the <184>gveda. The 18th mantra of ç
the former (yaj<210>ena yaj<210>amayajanta) is shown as the 16th in ç
the latter. The 16th and the 17th mantras (ved<193>hametam, dh<193>ta ç
purast<193>t) of the Yajurvedic text are not found in the <184>gvedic ç
reading.
@SPACE1 = 
Every Vedic mantra†for that matter, even the other mantras of the ç
<193>gamas and the tantras†has a <216><218>i (the seer, to whom the ç
mantra was originally revealed), a chandas (the metre in which it ç
is composed) and a devat<193> (the deity to whom it is addressed). ç
Before chanting the mantra one has to reverentially repeat these three ç
and also state the viniyoga or the purpose for which the mantra is ç
being uttered. Though the reverence shown to the <216><218>i and the ç
devat<193> is understandable, the same towards the chandas may appear ç
a little intriguing. Since each of the chandas or metres is believed ç
to be presided over by a deity like Agni, by whose grace only that ç
metrical composition is possible, this reverence is really towards ç
that deity.
As<|>applied<|>to the Puru<218>as<220>kta of the <184>gveda, the ç
<216><218>i is N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, the devat<193> is Puru<218>a ç
and the chandas is tri<218><219>ubh (16th mantra) and anu<218><219>ubh ç
(the rest).
Whether this <216><218>i N<193>r<193>ya<207>a was a human being like ç
Gautama, Atri, Vasi<218><219>ha or Vi·v<193>mitra, it is difficult ç
to say. Maybe that the name of the original <216><218>i had been forgotten ç
and later substituted by this word which indicates the subject-matter ç
of the S<220>kta. This method has sometimes been followed in naming ç
the <216><218>i of a s<220>kta in the <184>gveda (vide 10.121). ç
Since the description of the Puru<218>a here and that of N<193>r<193>ya<207>a ç
as given in another famous hymn, the N<193>r<193>ya<207>as<220>kta ç
of the Yajur<193>-ra<207>yaka, are identical, it can be assumed ç
that they are one and the same. Hence, the statement that the <216><218>i ç
is N<193>r<193>ya<207>a is based on this principle.

@S10 = Some Salient Concepts
@SPACE = 
The Puru<218>as<220>kta is a rather difficult text to comprehend ç
and hence to expound in a way that appeals to the modern mind, accustomed ç
as it is to the ways of physical sciences. The difficulty arises mainly ç
out of three factors:
@SPACE = 
@SPACE1 = 
@NO = a.
@NOK = It is a part of the <184>gveda which itself appears to be ç
an enigmatic text, due to its hoary antiquity.
@SPACE1 = 
@NO = b.
@NOK = As an extension of this, is the archaic language which does ç
not lend itself easily to interpretations based on the grammar of ç
classical Sanskrit.
@SPACE1 = 
@NO = c.
@NOK = Our difficulties are further compounded by the various terms ç
and concepts, which, though closely allied to the Vedic rituals, appear ç
to be symbolic and esoteric.
An attempt may now be made to list the more important concepts, including ç
the ones that appear to be recondite, for a detailed exposition. They ç
are: Puru<218>a; Vir<193><219>; Puru<218>a-yaj<210>a by the devas, ç
the s<193>dhyas and the <216><218>is; birth of the four Var<207>as; ç
further creation; j<210><193>na, mok<218>a and the nature of realisation; ç
cardinal dharmas and prayer for the fulfilment of desires.
Let us now try to explain and expound each of them.
@S10N = THE PURU<186>A
In the most general sense the word `puru<218>a' means a man. By extension, ç
it can mean a human being. However, in the Vedas, the Upani<218>ads ç
and the allied scriptures it is applied to God.
Derived from the root `p<214>' (= to protect, to fill up) the word ç
`puru<218>a' represents that principle or power which has filled the ç
whole universe and is protecting it. What else can it be than God ç
himself?
Sometimes it is also defined as `puri ·ete' (`one who lies in the ç
body of a living being'). Hence, Puru<218>a is the being immanent ç
in all creation, especially the living beings.
Puru<218>a is the manifested state of the unmanifested Brahman, the ç
origin and substratum of the universe. °dipuru<218>a (theprimeval ç
being), Parama-puru<218>a (the highest being), Param<193>tman (the ç
greatest self), Parame·vara (the supreme lord), N<193>r<193>ya<207>a ç
(the refuge of all the human beings) and Bhagav<193>n (the being endowed ç
with immensely great qualities)†these are some of the other names ç
by which he is known.
The description of the Puru<218>a as given in the Puru<218>as<220>kta ç
is simply awesome. Possessed of thousands of heads, eyes and feet, ç
he has enveloped this universe on all sides and has also transcended ç
it. He himself being this entire universe, he is also immanent in ç
it. Not only the present creation but also the ones of the past and ç
the future are verily he. He is the master of immortality. What appears ç
as the living beings, sustained by food, are also he. Though all this ç
(the manifested world) reveals his greatness, the Puru<218>a himself ç
is far greater than it. In fact, the entire manifested universe of ç
living beings and lifeless objects is only a fraction of his, whereas ç
his major part is concealed in heaven.
@S10N = PRIMARY CREATION†THE VIR°<187>
The question of creation of this world in which we live and move, ç
has ever remained a mystery to the human mind. According to the Hindu ç
religious traditions, the Vedas are the ultimate and sole authority ç
to enlighten us in this regard. Though the several descriptions of ç
creation given in the Vedic works including the Upani<218>ads appear ç
to differ from one another, there is a basic agreement also in regard ç
to Brahman (here called Puru<218>a) being the original, and the one ç
and the only, cause of the whole creation. The Puru<218>as<220>kta ç
being one of the earliest of such descriptions sticks to the same ç
pattern.
Creation  needs  two  fundamental objects: matter and living beings. ç
The Puru<218>a created these in the first phase. This can be termed ç
primary creation. He manifested out of himself the Vir<193><219>, ç
the immense being, the totality of all objects in their seed or root ç
form. He, again, entered into it and brought out the devas or the ç
`bright ones', the gods, who would carry on further or secondary creation ç
as entrusted or directed by him. He also manifested out of himself ç
the five subtle elements like the bh<220>mi or the earth and the bodies ç
of beings.
Who are these beings, called devas, s<193>dhyas and <216><218>is? ç
They are the various centres of power and action (indriyas and pr<193><207>as) ç
in the body of the Vir<193><219>, energised by the further infilling ç
of life-force and consciousness by the Puru<218>a himself. They are ç
called `devas' because of their power of consciousness (div = to shine), ç
`s<193>dhyas' because they are capable of bringing aboutfurther creation ç
(s<193>dh = to bring about) and <216><218>is because of their intuitive ç
knowledge (<216><218> = to know).
These devas†who themselves are the s<193>dhyas and the <216><218>is†now ç
take on the task of secondary and tertiary creation.
@S10N = SECONDARY CREATION<|>†<|><R>ç
THE PURU<186>AYAJ<178>A
The  Puru<218>as<220>kta  describes  the secondary creation as carried ç
out by the devas or gods as a yaj<210>a or sacrifice.
In the ancient days, yaj<210>as or y<193>gas† Vedic sacrifices†were ç
extremely common and were the major or the primary aspect of religion ç
in practice. Comprising the three parts†dravya (materials needed), ç
devat<193> (the deity to be propitiated) and ty<193>ga (oblation)†they ç
were not only popular but also frequently resorted to, for fulfilling ç
any desire or for bringing about a great result, where human efforts ç
were considered to be too inadequate to achieve the task and divine ç
intervention alone could accomplish it. Any task which needed great ç
efforts and sacrifice was being termed a yaj<210>a†though symbolically†and ç
the practice continues to the present day. Even the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> ç
(3.9) calls all good deeds of service as a yaj<210>a. Hence, it is ç
but natural that the Puru<218>as<220>kta describes the secondary ç
creation resorted to by the gods as a yaj<210>a.
Since it was before creation when nomaterials were available for ç
such a sacrifice, these gods performed it mentally, by  imagining  the  various  parts  and ç
processes involved in it. For them the body of the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a ç
himself was the sole basic material out of which they had to conduct ç
the sacrifice. Since this Puru<218>a was everything, including the ç
pa·u (or animal for immolation), in that sacrifice, we can call it ç
`Puru<218>ayaj<210>a'.
Then follows a very interesting des-cription of the yaj<210>a or sacrifice. ç
A yaj<210>a needs several things for performing it such as havis (sacrificial ç
materials like puro<195><193>·a or rice-cake), <193>jya (ghee), idhma ç
(fuel), pa·u (an animal like a goat for immolation and offering into ç
the fire) and so on. The process itself includes several acts†all  performed  with  appropriate ç
mantras or incantations†such as fixing the paridhis or borders for ç
the sacrificial fires, bandhana or tying the animal to the y<220>pastambha ç
or the sacrificial post, prok<218>a<207>a or sprinkling water on the ç
animal with sacrificial grass and many other items. Once a yaj<210>a ç
is performed with all its accessories and perfectly, it has to produce ç
its results, either here or hereafter.
@SPACE1 = 
The mental sacrifice performed by the gods as described in the S<220>kta ç
using a language that appears as a riddle, needs to be understood ç
in a proper perspective. It is a matter of our experience that a reality ç
of today was only a concept yesterday. A concept of today can become ç
a reality tomorrow. However, the worth and greatness of the person ç
who conceives such ideas is an important factor in the whole process.
Here, it is the devas†the divine beings who are all emanations from ç
the Puru<218>a himself and hence endowed with parts of his powers†that ç
are performing the s<193><209>kalpika or m<193>nasa yaj<210>a (mental ç
sacrifice, up<193>san<193> or deep meditation). Hence their mental ç
activities must result in physical products, whether subtle or gross.
@SPACE1 = 
The S<220>kta says that in the mental sacrifice the gods offered ç
the Vasanta-<216>tu (spring season) as <193>jya or ghee into the sacrificial ç
fire. It is a well-known fact that during the spring season the whole ç
flora and fauna will be at its best. Domestic animals, especially ç
the cows, can eat plenty of grass and hence can yield milk in profuse ç
quantities. So, milk, curds and ghee will be available in good quantity, ç
for being used in the sacrificial rites. This gives us a clue as to ç
the selection of the Vasanta or the spring for being offered as <193>jya ç
(ghee-oblation) in that sacrifice. However, neither ghee nor the spring ç
season existed then, at the time of this mental sacrifice! How then ç
could the gods perform it? Here, we have to stretch our powers of ç
imagination a little. These gods remembered the previous cycle of ç
creation and the last created world, remembered its spring season, ç
mentally converted it into <193>jya and poured it as oblation into ç
the fire of the present mental sacrifice. And, this oblation instantly ç
resulted in the physical production of the Vasanta-<216>tu or the ç
spring season of this creation. This logic or mode of explanation ç
can now be extended to the other items of the sacrifice in a similar ç
manner.
Thus were produced the seven chandas or Vedic metres, the twelve months, ç
the three worlds, the five seasons, all objects of pleasure and enjoyment, ç
various types of animals and the four Vedas. In other words, every ç
conceivable object of creation was produced out of that great mental ç
sacrifice of the gods.
It is interesting to note that in this act of creation, man comes ç
last. But, he is undoubtedly, the pinnacle of the whole process.
@SPACE1 = 
The S<220>kta, while narrating the creation of the human beings, ç
puts it in a picturesque way. When the gods offered the various limbs ç
of the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a who himself had been treated as the ç
pa·u or animal for the sacrifice, into the sacrificial fire†of course, ç
all in imagination since it was a mental or symbolic sacrifice†there ç
came out of that offering, the people of the four var<207>as or groups†the ç
br<193>hma<207>a, the k<218>attriya, the vai·ya and the ·<220>dra. ç
The br<193>hma<207>a emerged out of the face (or the mouth) of the ç
Vir<193><219>puru<218>a, the k<218>attriya (called r<193>janya) was ç
produced out of his arms, the vai·ya was created out of his two thighs ç
whereas the ·<220>dra sprang from his feet. In other words, these ç
people of the four var<207>as were produced when the respective limbs ç
of the Vir<193><219>-puru<218>a were offered in that symbolic, mental, ç
sacrifice.
The creation process continued further when the moon and the sun were ç
born out of his mind and eyes. Indra and Agni emerged out of his mouth. ç
So also V<193>yu or air was produced out of his pr<193><207>a or vital ç
breath. This was followed by the appearance of antarik<218>a (intervening ç
space) from the navel, heaven from the head, earth from the feet, ç
directions from the ears as also all the worlds.
The creation of the human beings as belonging to the four well-known ç
var<207>as or social groups and describing their emergence from the ç
different limbs of the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a, especially of the ç
·<220>dra from the feet, has raised bitter controversies and heated ç
debates. The statement has even been construed as a machination of ç
the br<193>hma<207>as to subdue and enslave theothers, especially ç
the ·<220>dras. The rancour generated by such polemics based on a ç
misunderstanding of the text, coupledwith or nurtured by unhappy ç
social environment has done enough damage to the solidarity of the ç
Hindu society. Hencethe subject needs a more extensive treatment.
@S10N = THE VARØA SYSTEM AND<R>ç
THE PURU<186>AS<188>KTA
Choosing a vocation as per one's desire and aptitude is a common pheno-menon ç
seen in all civilised societies. It is the duty of the society to ç
provide suitable opportunities for the citizens to choose and pursue ç
those vocations that conform to their nature. This is the principle ç
and philosophy behind the var<207>a system. It is prak<216>ti or nature ç
that brought it into being and not the Puru<218>as<220>kta, which ç
has not only recognised its existence but has also described it picturesquely, ç
in a highly poetical and symbolic language.
It is sometimes alleged that the var<207>a system did not exist in ç
the early Vedic society but appeared at its fag end. Since the Puru<218>as<220>kta ç
refers to it, this work must be, chronologically speaking, a later ç
composition added on to the earlier part. But this is not correct ç
since there are enough references in other parts of the <184>gveda ç
to the already existing var<207>a system (vide <184>gveda Sa<221>hit<193> ç
8.35.16,17; 1.108.7).
@SPACE1 = 
The br<193>hma<207>as were the custodians of Vedic knowledge and culture. ç
The organ of speech was their forte. Hence the depiction of their ç
birth as from the mouth or the face of the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a ç
is, symbolically speaking, correct. Similarly, the birth of the k<218>attriyas ç
or the r<193>janyas (fighters and kings) from the arms of the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a ç
is also meet since physical strength and military skill were their ç
speciality. The vai·yas were the main segment of the population supporting ç
and sustaining the whole society by their economic activities. Hence ç
the description of their being born out of the thighs of the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a ç
is proper. Without the feet, the body cannot stand erect, in a state ç
of balance. So too the society cannot exist without the supply of ç
physical labour, which was the chosen occupation of the ·<220>dras ç
since they were not fit for the other three occupations. Therefore ç
the description that they were born out of the feet of the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a ç
is in order. One more factor to be kept in mind is that all the persons ç
of all the four var<207>as were born out of the body of the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a ç
(an aspect of God) and not from a lesser entity or a mortal like ç
us. Hence all are equally divine. Are not the feet of a sugar doll ç
as sweet as its head?
Throughout the history of the human race, such divisions have existed. ç
Socio-logists have discovered this system existing among the people ç
of ancient Greece, China and Persia. Germany, Japan and Russia too ç
have had it. Other countries of Europe were no exception. It may be ç
interesting to note that untouchables existed even in a Muslim country ç
like Arabia  though  they  were  also  local Muslims!
Social hierarchy is an inevitable fact of life which cannot be wished ç
away. It exists even today in all societies including the socialist ç
or the communist.
Much of the discontent roused by the Puru<218>as<220>kta among the ç
·<220>dras was, mainly, due to two factors: the notion that the `head' ç
is superior and the `feet' are inferior in status; the nasty treatment ç
that they have sometimes received at the hands of the upper classes ç
of the society.
@SPACE1 = 
The former is a notion that does not stand close scrutiny. Except ç
in the game of football, where the head and the feet may be of equal ç
importance, in all other situations of our life, the relative importance ç
of our limbs varies as the occasion demands. For instance, while doing ç
abhi<218>eka or giving a ceremonial bath to the deity in a temple, ç
or, laying the foundation stone for a building it is the hand (am<216>tahasta?) ç
that gets precedence and not the head. While honouring the elders, ç
especially the religious leaders, p<220>ja (or worship) is done to ç
the feet and not to the head! While tending little children with love, ç
we keep them in our lap (thighs) and not on our crown! A cripple will ç
perhaps consider the possession of feet as more important!
As regards the latter, the mistake lies mainly with the first two ç
var<207>as who sometimes have misused their position to harass or ç
oppress the last group. Such oppression, however, has happened in ç
all the societies of the world in its long history. But in India, ç
this has been more of an exception than the rule. In fact, important ç
religious works like the Mah<193>bh<193>rata (vide Vanaparva ç
181.20-26) have declared that the br<193>hma<207>ahood depends not ç
on the accident of birth but on the possession of godly virtues.
Once the basic truth, that diversity is a fact of life brought about ç
by nature, is realised and serious attention is directed towards achieving ç
unity and harmony, co-operation and coordination, in spite of that ç
diversity, so that all human beings can live in peace, the problem ç
stands dissolved. The Hindu seers had foreseen the need for such efforts. ç
They were apprehensive of the possibilities of the first var<207>a ç
misusing its privileges and status. That is why attempts had been ç
made to offset such tendencies by prescribing that a br<193>hma<207>a ç
could take food in the house of a ·<220>dra who was serving him in ç
some form (vide Manusm<216>ti 6.253; Y<193>j<210>avalkya Sm<216>ti ç
1.166; Par<193>·ara Sm<216>ti 11.19).
@SPACE1 = 
More than everything else, the ·<220>dras had never been denied spiritual ç
knowledge and wisdom, which was the birthright of every human being. ç
There have been many great saints from among the ·<220>dras and even ç
from the untouchables as illustrated by V<193>lm<200>ki, Vy<193>sa, ç
Dharmavy<193>dha, Vidura, Nandan<193>r, Raid<193>s, Kanakad<193>sa, ç
Tirupp<193><207> °<202>var and a host of others who are being highly ç
venerated even now, by all sections of the Hindu society.
One more fact may be noted here. Is it not rather remarkable that ç
the br<193>hma<207>as, even though they had neither the military power ç
nor the economic power, were respected and obeyed for over five thousand ç
years by the Hindu society? Could it be for any other factor than ç
their devotion to satya and dharma (truth and righteousness), to their ç
sublime character? Is it not equally noteworthy that in the dharma·<193>stras ç
(scriptural works dealing with the conduct of people) they composed, ç
they have voluntarily bound themselves with more stringent rules than ç
they have prescribed for others?
It is nevertheless an undeniable fact that the caste system as it ç
obtains today has very little in common with the original spirit of ç
the var<207>a system. The evils generated, including the animosity ç
amongst the people of various castes† seem to far outweigh the advantages. ç
The Hindu society in this post-independence era, characterised by ç
tremendous advancement in science and technology, throwing open all ç
professions to all persons, is absolutely free to bring about healthy ç
changes. The fact has been well-recognised by the ancient sages who ç
composed the sm<216>tis and dharma·<193>stras that when people dislike ç
a custom or a social system they can give it up and substitute it ç
by better ones (vide Manusm<216>ti 4.176; Y<193>j<210>a-valkya ç
Sm<216>ti 1.156).
@SPACE1 = 
In spite of its several shortcomings and even aberrations, if the ç
caste system based solely on birth, has survived for five to six thousand ç
years, there must undoubtedly be something good in it. Perhaps, the ç
psychological sense of belonging to a recognised social group and ç
the consequent security it has offered may be the main reasons for ç
the same. Hence, it is much wiser to attempt reforming it or even ç
replace it with a better system than totally uprooting it, or, substituting ç
it with a worse system like the one based on the power of money or ç
ethnic differences or political patronage.
It may be useful to remember here the declaration of Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda, ç
the great prophet of modern India, that the giving of good education ç
which includes culture, will go a long way in the levelling up of ç
the society.
@S10N = SECONDARY CREATION†<R>ç
FURTHER DETAILS
The S<220>kta goes on to describe further creation by the devas ç
from the Vir<193><219>-puru<218>a. From his mind emerged the moon. ç
The sun was born out of his eyes. Indra and Agni emanated from his ç
face or mouth. So also V<193>yu (air) came out of his pr<193><207>a ç
(life-force or vital air). Dyuloka or the heaven, bh<220>mi or the ç
earth and antarik<218>a or the intervening space were born respectively ç
out of his head, feet and the navel. Similarly all the other worlds ç
and their beings were also created.
With this, practically, ends the des-cription of creation from the ç
Puru<218>a.
@SPACE1 = 
One notable thing in this description is, perhaps, the relationship ç
between the moon and our minds. Since our minds are parts of the cosmic ç
mind and the moon is also a product of that cosmic mind, the influence ç
of the moon on our minds cannot be ruled out. The very word `lunacy' ç
used as a synonym for insanity (Luna = moon) and the aggravation or ç
subsidence of symptoms with the changing phases of the moon, confirm ç
this.
The human mind has always been interested in knowing how this creation ç
has come about. Since it itself is a product of the created world ç
it can never succeed in knowing this secret. The <185>ruti or the ç
Vedas are the only authority for knowing it. However, the descriptions ç
given in the Vedas, including the Upani<218>ads, are so variegated ç
that we do not get a clear-cut picture of the same. Neither do the ç
attempts made in the works like the Brahmas<220>tras to give a coordinated ç
picture, help us much. Hence, the only way of resolving the problem ç
is to concede that the main purpose of the <185>ruti is to draw our ç
attention to the Creator, (and not to the creation as such which is ç
only a projection from out of himself), the need to know him and the ç
consequent beatitude we attain.
This attainment of beatitude has been expressed in exquisitely enchanting ç
terms by a <216><218>i in the Puru<218>as<220>kta to inspire and ç
guide the spiritual aspirants.
@S10N = BLISS OF REALISATION
One of the most important questions discussed by the Hindu philosophical ç
works is the final goal of human life. According to the Vedas and ç
the Ved<193>nta, this goal is mok<218>a or liberation from transmigration. ç
This mok<218>a, according to them, is rediscovering our eternal relationship ç
with that Puru<218>a variously called as Paramapuru<218>a, Param<193>tman, ç
®·vara, Parame·vara, Brahman, °tman and so on. This is possible only ç
through j<210><193>na or knowledge which is anubhava or direct experience ç
or realisation and not just intellectual understanding.
The Puru<218>as<220>kta teaches us this fundamental  truth  by  describing  the ç
ecstatic experience of realisation of a <216><218>i and an unequivocal ç
declaration that there is absolutely no other path to immortality ç
than the knowledge or the direct experience of that Puru<218>a who ç
is brilliant like the sun and is beyond tamas, darkness of ignorance. ç
Though karma or Vedic rituals have been eulogised and prescribed, ç
they are only aids in the spiritual path and are of secondary importance.
This statement can also serve the purpose of guiding an aspirant in ç
the path of meditation on the supreme Puru<218>a.
@S10N = SPIRITUAL WISDOM AND<R>ç
SPIRITUAL TEACHERS
Hindu samprad<193>ya or tradition vehemently asserts that all knowledge, ç
especially spiritual wisdom, generally called `adhy<193>tmavidy<193>', ç
has to be obtained personally from a competent guru or spiritual preceptor. ç
And, who else can be a better guru than the Puru<218>a himself? The ç
Puru<218>as<220>kta automatically stresses this point when it declares ç
that this wisdom was first taught by the Puru<218>a to Dh<193>t<193> ç
(the four faced Brahm<193>, the creator) who taught it to <185>akra ç
or Indra. Indra then spread it in all directions through worthy <216><218>is ç
or sages.
@S10N = PRIMARY DHARMAS OR DUTIES
Though the Puru<218>as<220>kta has accorded primary importance to ç
the description of the Puru<218>a and the process of creation, as ç
also to spiritual knowledge, as the sole means of mok<218>a or liberation, ç
it has not forgotten to stress the significance of performing one's ç
allotted duties in life. While declaring that the devas worshipped ç
the Puru<218>a through yaj<210>a or sacrifice, the S<220>kta has ç
also proclaimed <|>that<|><|>these<|><|>dharmas became the primary or the ç
cardinal ones contributing to the sustenance of the world. This statement ç
needs a little amplification.
The devas had been allotted the task of secondary creation by the ç
Puru<218>a, who had also supplied them the raw-material, in the form ç
of the Vir<193><219>. They used this raw-material, performed the m<193>nasayaj<210>a ç
or mental sacrifice and completed the task of creation as allotted ç
to them. It goes to their credit that they found out their respective ç
duties and performed them with single-minded devotion. This itself ç
became their worship of the Puru<218>a.
This has a great lesson for us, the human beings. God has given us ç
a ready- made world. It is well-regulated by the cosmic laws. Even ç
the gods worked†and are still working†within the ambit of these laws, ç
for the good of the whole world. A yaj<210>a, in spirit, means just ç
this, offering the individual good into the cosmic or the universal ç
good, by performing one's duties to the best of one's ability and ç
always keeping in mind the cosmic good.
@SPACE1 = 
The day the devas performed the very first m<193>nasa-yaj<210>a or ç
mental sacrifice, thatvery day were born the `prathama-dharmas' or ç
the first karmas, which became a model to the human beings aftercreation. ç
The Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (3.9-16) describes the jagaccakra or the ç
universal cycle in which all beings and things are linked with one ç
another, because of which the world runs smoothly. If each person ç
performs his svadharma or allotted duty, not only does the world run ç
smoothly but also that very svadharma-karma becomes a worship of the ç
Lord leading to siddhi or spiritual fulfilment.
@S10N = ATTAINMENT OF HEAVEN
Being full of desires as they are, the human beings aspire for the ç
attainment of heaven after death. The Hindu scriptures do contain ç
plenty of references to such higher lokas or abodes, of which the ç
svargaloka is the one most sought after. The Puru<218>as<220>kta ç
also refers to this as N<193>ka, the world free from all sorrow, the ç
heaven, where the ancient devas and s<193>dhyas live and to where ç
the noble ones who contemplate on the Puru<218>a, go. Then there are ç
others too, who wish to attain the status of the Praj<193>patis (progenitors ç
or secondary creators) like Mar<200>ci, Atri and others.
However the main stress of the S<220>kta is on mukti or liberation ç
through the knowledge of Puru<218>a.
@S10N = OBEISANCE AND PRAYERS
The S<220>kta ends with an obeisance to the self-luminous Puru<218>a ç
by the gods who also declare their subservience to any person who ç
succeeds in knowing that Puru<218>a.
The hymn closes with a beautiful description of the Puru<218>a, as ç
identified with N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, with his two consorts, Hr<200> ç
and Lak<218>m<200>. Day and night are his lateral limbs. The stars ç
(along with the moon) form his body as it were. Heaven an<%26>d<%0>earth ç
seem like the two halves of hi<%22>s<%0>open mouth.
Generally, Bh<220>dev<200> (the earth) and <185>r<200>dev<200> (Lak<218>m<200>, ç
the goddess of wealth) are projected as the two consorts of Vi<218><207>u-N<193>r<193>ya<207>a ç
whereas here Bh<220> has been replaced by Hr<200>. Hr<200> is the ç
goddess of modesty. It is to impress upon us, perhaps, that wealth, ç
beauty and other embellishments, if not controlled or tempered by ç
hr<200> or modesty, will lead to disaster, that these two have been ç
stated together.
The S<220>kta concludes with a prayer to the Puru<218>a to give ç
the supplicant all objects of pleasure and happiness, here and hereafter, ç
as also the knowledge of the Self.
@S10 = Finis
To sum up, the Puru<218>as<220>kta gives us in a capsule form, the ç
philosophy of not only the Vedas and the Ved<193>nta, but also of ç
the Bhagavadg<200>t<193>, giving equal importance to up<193>san<193> ç
(meditation), j<210><193>na (knowledge), bhakti (devotion) and dharma ç
or karma (rituals and performance of one's duties). No wonder then ç
that it is highly venerated and extensively used even today in all ç
our religious observances.
@NT = Puru<218>avidy<193>

The Upani<218>ads deal with several vidy<193>s†modes of meditation†most ç

The literal meaning of the word is `the best of men.' However, it ç

After dividing this world into two classes of puru<218>as†the k<218>arapuru<218>as ç
(bound souls) and the ak<218>arapuru<218>as (theliberated ones)†the ç

has transcended the other two.
The well-known Vi<218><207>usahasran<193>ma (24) uses this word ç
also to indicate the Lord Vi<218><207>u. Out of the several interpretations ç

by name, whom he killed with his lotus, after converting it into a ç
formidable weapon through mantras or sacred  chants.  Hence  that  place†the ç
present Pu<218>kara†came to be known as Pu<218>kara (= lotus).
The same legend says that the lotus in his hand rebounded at three ç
places before killing the demon. All these three places became lakes, ç
respectively known as Jye<218><219>ha-pu<218>kara, Madhya-pu<218>kara ç
and Kani<218><219>ha-pu<218>kara. The presiding deities of these three ç
are Brahm<193>, Vi<218><207>u and Rudra.
At the Jye<218><219>a-pu<218>kara Brahm<193> is said to have performed ç
a yaj<210>a or a sacrifice. Hence animals are not allowed to be killed ç
in this area.
The greatest festival of Pu<218>kara isheld on the K<193>rttika P<220>r<207>im<193> ç
day (generally in November). Lakhs of pilgrims gather here on that ç
day to take bath in the main lake and worship Brahm<193>.

Whether the science of aeronautics was known to the ancient Hindus ç
or not, Pu<218>paka or Pu<218>pakavim<193>na, the most wonderful aeroplane†the ç
like of which never existed earlier nor would, in future† has often ç
been mentioned in the Hindu scriptural works.
The Pu<218>paka originally belonged to Kubera, the god of wealth. ç
It had been given to him by none other than Brahm<193>, the creator ç
himself, as a gift. It had been manufactured by Vi·vakarma, the chief ç
architect and engineer of the gods in heaven. It was extraordinarily ç
elegant, highly decorated, could accommodate any number of people ç
by expanding (and contracting) and could fly independently at the ç
`speed of mind' (manovega)!
R<193>va<207>a, the demon-king, had usurped it from Kubera (his own ç
cousin!) after conquering him in the battle.
When R<193>ma killed R<193>va<207>a, Vibh<200><218>a<207>a offered ç

Yuddhak<193><207><195>a, 124.9-12). When R<193>ma wanted Kubera, ç
the original owner, to take it back, the latter gifted it to R<193>ma ç
himself.
R<193>ma then ordered the Pu<218>paka to move about freely at will, ç
but to return to him whenever he wanted it.

The words `pu<218><219>i' and `pu<218><219>im<193>rga' are  his  contribution  to  the  bhakti ç
literature.
He categorises bhakti or devotion to God into `mary<193>d<193>bhakti' ç
and `pu<218><219>i-bhakti'.
The devotion that follows the beaten track as per the various steps ç
given inthe scriptures like ·rava<207>a (listening to the glories ç
of God), k<200>rtana (singing devotional songs) and arcana (worship) ç
belongs to the first category. The j<200>vas (souls) or s<193>dhakas ç
(aspirants) who follow this path have to depend much on self-effort.
Pu<218><219>im<193>rga is the path of devotion categorised as `pu<218><219>i'.
`Pu<218><219>i' literally means `nourishment'. It means the special ç
spiritual nourishment that a s<193>dhaka gets when God's grace descends ç
on him. It has nothing to do with the fattening of the body with nourishing ç
food, as some epicureans want us to believe!
In this path, the j<200>va on whom the grace of God falls, is called ç
`pu<218><219>i'. He is the one whom God has accepted as his own. These ç
j<200>vas have an innate and unconditional love and attachment to ç
him. That love is actually a reflection of the light of divine favour ç
and fervour on that blessed soul.

Well-known scriptures on bhakti ordevotion advocate navavidha-bhakti ç

his names and glories), smara<207>a (remembering him constantly), ç
p<193>dasevana (serving the feet of his images), arcana (ritualistic ç
worship), vandana (obeisance to him), d<193>sya (cultivating the attitude ç
that one is his servant), sakhya (an attitude of friendship towards ç
him) and <193>tmanivedana (offering oneself completely to him or total ç
self-surrender) (vide Bh<193>gavata 7.5.23).
The  first  eight  modes  belong  to the  mode  of  mary<193>d<193>-bhakti.  In  the ç
pu<218><219>im<193>rga, the devotee starts with the last mode (<193>tmanivedana). ç
Realising that the grace of God is the sole means of achieving spiritual ç
progress, he gets the mantra of self-dedication from a qualified guru  in  a  ceremony  called  `brahma- ç
sambandha.' This absolves him of all his past sins even as the river ç

king; the king honouring all the priests involved in the rite; release ç
of animals meant for slaughter; release of all prisoners except those ç
who have tried to harm him or rebelled against him.
Sometimes, the pu<218>yasn<193>na has been described as a part of ç
lak<218>ahoma also.
@NT = putra
@N1 = (`one who saves [the father from the hell called] pum')
The desire for a worthy son (or sons) is a universal phenomenon noticed ç
in almost all societies, ancient or modern. The Hindus believed that ç
he would save the father from a special kind of hell called `pum'. ç
Hence the name `putra'. A son born from a sacramentally and legally ç
sanctioned marriage, as per the dictates of the dharma·<193>stras, ç
was called `aurasa-putra,' a son born out of one's own bosom.
These dharma·<193>stras describe twelve kinds of sons, many of whom ç
have been considered as illegitimate. Only the aurasa and the dattaka ç
(adopted son) are legally eligible for recognition.
If it was the duty of the parents to bring up the son by giving him ç
proper education, training and culture, it was equally the latter's ç
duty to take care of them while living and perform all the obsequial ç
rites properly after their death.
As regards the inheritance of the parental property by the sons, some ç
of the dharma·<193>stras (Manusm<216>ti 9.112; Y<193>j<210>avalkyasm<216>ti ç
2.114) gave a greater portion to the eldest son, though many others ç
recommended that it be distributed equally among all the sons.
It  was  the  duty  of  the  sons, especially the eldest one, to take ç
care of the parents.
@NT = Putrak<193>me<218><219>i
@N1 = (`a [Vedic] sacrifice [to be performed by] one desiring for ç
a son')
The desire for a worthy son is a natural phenomenon in all the societies ç
of the world; more so in the ancient Hindu society. Understanding ç
this, the <216><218>is of yore had prescribed a particular Vedic sacrifice ç
called `Putrak<193>me<218><219>i' or `Putre<218><219>i' for the fulfilment ç
of this desire.
King Da·aratha is said to haveperformed it on the advice of the sage ç
<184><218>ya- ·<216><209>ga (vide R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, B<193>lak<193><207><195>a ç
15).
The king performed the A·vamedha-y<193>ga first, to purify himself ç
and then only the Putrak<193>me<218><219>i.
The R<193>m<193>ya<207>a says that the mantras were taken from the ç
Atharva·iras (vide B<193>lak<193><207><195>a 15.2 and 3). The ç
°·val<193>yana <185>rautas<220>tras also describes it.
However, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to get the details.
@NT = putrik<193>
@N1 = (`daughter treated like a son')
When a person has only one putr<200> or daughter and no sons, he can ç
ceremonially adopt her as a son. Then she is called `putrik<193>'.
Alternatively, she can be given in marriage to a suitable bridegroom ç
under the condition that her son will be adopted by him (the father ç
of the girl) as his own son. In this case, the boy may be called `putrik<193>putra'. ç
However, this latter word may also mean putrik<193> herself.
Such a daughter is entitled to perform all the obsequial rites of ç
her parents, just like a son.
