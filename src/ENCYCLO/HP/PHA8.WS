@NT = Pratardana
@EMERGENCY = Pratardana, the king of K<193>·<200>, was the son of ç
Divod<193>sa and M<193>dhav<200>. His story appears first in the Kau<218><200>taki ç
Br<193>hma<207>opani<218>ad (3.1-8) of the <184>gveda.
@EMERGENCY = By the dint of his prowess and heroism, he goes to the ç
world of Indra who asks him to choose any boon. Though Pratardana ç
refuses to ask any, Indra† identified here with Supreme Brahman† teaches ç
him about his own greatness and asks him to meditate on himself (i.<|>e., ç
Indra) as pr<193><207>a (life-force) and praj<210><193>tman (the Intelligent ç
Self).
@EMERGENCY = The  entire  section  is  known  as Pratardanavidy<193> ç
or Pr<193><207>avidy<193>.
@EMERGENCY = The story as given in the Mah<193>-bh<193>rata (Anu·<193>sanaparva ç
30) states that the king Pratardana whose race had almost been exterminated ç
by the Haihaya king V<200>tahavya and his sons, went in pursuit of ç
the fleeing V<200>tahavya. The latter was given shelter by the sage ç
Bh<216>gu who protected him. Hence Pratardana had to return to his ç
kingdom without destroying his enemy.
However, by the grace of the sage Bh<216>gu, V<200>tahavya became ç
a br<193>hma<207>a of highly s<193>ttvik nature; and, Pratardana gave ç
up his enmity.

According to the Vy<193>sabh<193><218>ya on the Yogas<220>tras ç
(3.51) of Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>), the yogis can be categorised ç
into four groups: prathamakalpika; madhubh<220>mika; praj<210><193>jyoti; ç
and atikr<193>ntabh<193>van<200>ya. The prathamakalpika has just started ç
the practice of yoga. He has not had any experience.
The madhubh<220>mika has got sam<193>dhi on the pa<210>cabh<220>tas ç
(elements) and the indriyas (senses). He has succeeded in getting ç
<216>tambharapraj<210><193>, the state of consciousness which gives ç
the truth of everything that the yogi thinks of.
The praj<210><193>jyoti is the third type of yogi who has conquered ç
the sense-organs and the five elements and is very near to puru<218>akhy<193>ti ç
or realisation of the <193>tman, the Self.
The atikr<193>ntabh<193>van<200>ya, the last, has attained<|> the<|><|>knowledge<|><|>of<|> ç
the<|><|>Self and hence a j<200>vanmukta, a liberated soul.
@NT = pratibandhikalpan<193>
@N1 = (`showing the same defect in the opposite party')
This is one of the eleven modes of tarka or logic.
The Ny<193>ya philosophy states that the param<193><207>us (atoms) ç
are without parts, but can combine to produce bigger material objects. ç
If the Ved<193>ntin raises the objection that a partless param<193><207>u ç
can never come into contact with another param<193><207>u which is ç
also partless, the Ny<193>ya-philosopher raises a similar objection ç
regarding Brahman which is all-pervading (and hence without parts), ç
viz., how it can come into contact with the objects of this world ç
like pots. This type of raising a counter objection is called pratibandhikalpan<193>.
@NT = pr<193>tibha
@N1 = (`intuition')
Many a power is hidden in the mind. Spiritual disciplines involving ç
purification and concentration bring out these hidden powers.
One such, mentioned in the Yoga-s<220>tras (3.33 and 36) of Pata<210>jali ç
(200 <MS>B.C.<D>) is the pr<193>tibha. It is the power by which correct ç
and clear knowledge about any object arises in the mind just by a ç
wish, needing no other means.
It may be the knowledge concerning a very subtle object (s<220>k<218>ma), ç
an object which is hidden (vyavahita) or at a great distance (viprak<216><218>ta); ç
and also the know-ledge of past and future events.

@NT = pratigara
@N1 = (`response')
A Vedic sacrifice involves several rites and minor rites including ç
the chanting of certain classes of ·astras (See <MS><185>ASTRA<D> ç
for details.).
The hot<216> priest issues a call called <193>h<193>va (See also <MS>°H°VA.<D>) ç
to which the adhvaryu priest responds by loudly uttering the pratigara ç
(reply or response).
There are several <193>h<193>vas for which there are appropriate pratigaras ç
also.
For instance, for the <193>h<193>va, ``<185>o<221> 3 s<193>vo3m'' ç
(``Let us both praise!''), the (reply) pratigara is ``Othamo daiv<193>'' ç
or ``<185>o<221>s<193>mo daiv<193>'' (``Let us praise the deity!'').
In course of time the two seem to have acquired a mystical significance. ç
Several permutations and combinations were evolved because of this.
@NT = pratih<193>ra, pratihart<216>
The udg<193>t<216> is one of the four principal priests in a Vedic ç
sacrifice, representing the S<193>maveda and singing the s<193>mans ç
at the appropriate stages in a sacrifice. He has three assistants ç
one of whom is the pratihart<216> or pratihart<193>. It is his duty ç
to chant the pratih<193>ra (a part of the s<193>man, introduced with ç
the chant hu<221>). The pratih<193>ra is like a reply or response ç
to prast<193>va, the first part of a s<193>man.
See also <MS>S°MAN.<D>
@NT = pratij<210><193>
@N1 = (`statement of assurance or<R>ç
assertion')
The general meaning of the word is `giving word,' `asserting something ç
as true,' `a statement of fact'.
However, in the Ny<193>yadar·ana (Hindu logic) it is the first of ç
the five steps of a logical statement.
Pratij<210><193> is a statement of fact, as asserted by one who is ç
ready to prove it.
For instance: `parvato vahnim<193>n,' `there is fire on the hill.'
This is subsequently proved by four steps: hetu (reason); ud<193>hara<207>a ç
(instance, example); upanaya (application of the general to the particular) ç
and nigamana (final conclusion).
@NT = prat<200>kop<193>san<193>
@N1-1 = (`meditation on a symbol')
Though the word up<193>san<193> literally means `sitting near (God)', ç
it is always used in the sense of worship or meditation.
Hinduism posits mok<218>a or liberation from transmigratory existence ç
as the final goal of life (called paramapuru<218><193>rtha).
There are two royal paths leading to this: the path of j<210><193>na ç
(knowledge) and the path of bhakti (devotion), also called J<210><193>nayoga ç
and Bhaktiyoga respectively.
In both these paths up<193>san<193> has an important place.
In the J<210><193>nayoga, the up<193>san<193> has to be on the <193>tman ç
(the Self within) which is nir<193>k<193>ra (formless) and nirgu<207>a ç
(without any attribute), but whose essence is sat-cit-<193>nanda (existence-consciousness-bliss). ç
Since this up<193>san<193> or meditation is extremely difficult for ç
the beginners or the ordinary aspirants, a prat<200>ka or a symbol ç
like pra<207>ava (O<221>, the sound), s<220>rya (the sun), <193>k<193>·a ç
(space), agni (fire) and so on, is chosen for meditation.
For those who find even this as a difficult path, Bhaktiyoga recommends ç
meditation on the images of gods or goddesses. Here, the image is ç
not considered God, but only as an aid to imagine in one's own heart, ç
God as a being of light and consciousness, lovingly responding to ç
one's prayers.
Such meditations come under the category of prat<200>kop<193>san<193>.

In general, the word means a person who can act on behalf of someone ç
else; or a substitute in a rite.
The P<220>rvam<200>m<193><221>s<193> system, while dealing with Vedic ç
sacrifices, is very definite that a pratinidhi or substitute is not ç
allowed with regard to the devat<193> (deity), the five Vedic fires, ç
the particular mantra to be chanted on a particular occasion, certain ç
specially prescribed rites as also the sv<193>min (the sacrificer).
The Atrism<216>ti (verses 50 and 51) permits a person to perform ç
Ga<209>g<193>sn<193>na (bath in the river Ga<209>g<193>) vicariously ç
by requesting another who is actually going on a pilgrimage, in case ç
he himself is unable to do so due to old-age, disease or any other ç
valid reason. This second person has to do it by immersing a doll ç
made of ku·a grass in the river with appropriate mantras. This doll ç
then becomes a `prati-nidhi' of the first person who is unable to ç
perform the pilgrimage.

@NT = pratipattikarma
@N1 = (`action done<R>ç

@SPACE = 
This word has been used in various senses.
The most general sense is abandoning something after its use is over. ç
For instance, when an <193>hit<193>gni (one who has established Vedic ç
fires) dies, all the wooden vessels and implements he was using in ç
performing sacrifices, are disposed off, by keeping them on the various ç
parts of his body during its cremation (vide the P<220>rvam<200>m<193><221>s<193>s<220>tras ç
(11.3.34).
After a sacrifice had been completed, the horn of a stag that was ç
being used for scratching (one's limbs when necessary), had to be ç
abandoned in a pit called c<193>tv<193>la, near the sacrificial shed. ç
This too was called pratipattikarma.
The immersing of a clay image in water, after duly worshipping it ç
(as in the worship of Ga<207>e·a or Durg<193>) is also a pratipattikarma.

@SPACE1 = 
@SPACE = 
The Vedas, which are the basic scriptures of Hinduism, are difficult ç
to understand due to two primary reasons: the archaic language and ç
the special phonetic system.
Out of the six Ved<193><209>gas†subsidiary sciences that help us to ç
understand the Vedas†the first two, viz., the <185>ik<218><193> and ç
the Vy<193>kara<207>a (phonetics and grammar) help us to unravel these ç
two aspects.
The Pr<193>ti·<193>khyas are the earlier phase of development of these ç
two aspects. Literally the word means a treatise pertaining to the ç
particular ·<193>kh<193> or branch of the Veda. Going by this definition, ç
every ·<193>kh<193> of the Vedas†and there were hundreds of them as ç
mentioned in allied works†must have had its own Pr<193>ti-·<193>khya.
However, only very few of them† belonging to all the four Vedas†have ç
survived till today.
They generally deal with topics like pronunciation, intonation, sandhis ç
(rules of conjunction of letters or words), shortening or lengthening ç
of the vowels, rules connected with the breaking up of sa<221>hit<193>-p<193><219>ha ç
(Vedic mantras in sentences) into padap<193><219>ha (constituent words) ç
and so on.
A brief description of some of thesePr<193>ti·<193>khyas may now ç
be attempted here:
@SPACE1 = 
The <184>kpr<193>ti·<193>khya of <185>aunaka (a disciple of °·val<193>yana)†also ç
known as <185>ik<218><193>·<193>stra  and  P<193>r<218>ada†is  a  very ç
ancient and important work. It is closely associated with the Sa<221>hitopani<218>ad ç
part of the Aitareya °ra<207>yaka (3.1.1). It echoes the opinions ç
of the various <193>c<193>ryas (teachers of Vedic tradition) like ç
M<193><207><195><220>keya, M<193>k<218>arya, Agastya, <185><220>rav<200>ra ç
and others.
It is in the form of s<220>tras or ka<207><195>ikas (short sentences ç
in prose), with a commentary by Uva<219>a. Another commentary by Vi<218><207>umitra ç
is available only for the first two sections.
There are three sections of six pa<219>alas(subsections) each, making ç
a total of 18 pa<219>alas with 103 ka<207><195>ik<193>s.
The subjects dealt with are: sa<221>j<210><193> (definitions); sandhis ç
or conjunctions like pra·li<218><219>a and udgr<193>ha; svaras (intonations); ç
some more sandhis like natisandhi; kramap<193><219>ha (a kind of breaking ç
up of Vedic sentences); opinions of various other teachers; defects ç
of pronunciation and intonation; traditional methods of chanting the ç
Vedas; about the various Vedic meters and allied subjects.
The Taittir<200>yapr<193>ti·<193>khya has two pra·nas (sections), ç
each containing twelve adhy<193>yas or chapters. It is also in the ç
form of s<220>tras. There are three well-known commentaries: Padakramasadana ç
of M<193>hi<218>eya; Tribh<193><218><193>ratna of Somay<193>rya ç
and Vaidik<193>bhara<207>a of Gop<193>layajv<193>.
The first of these is the most ancient one. It deals with a `prak<216>tip<193><219>ha' ç
or a basic reading of a Vedic sentence from which the padap<193><219>ha ç
and the kramap<193><219>ha can be derived. In addition it also deals ç
with the sandhis related to the topics under consideration.
@SPACE1 = 
Belonging to the <185>ukla Yajurveda group is the V<193>jasaney<200> ç
Pr<193>ti·<193>khya of K<193>ty<193>yana. He is different from the ç
K<193>ty<193>yana who has written a v<193>rttika on P<193><207>ini's ç
A<218><219><193>dhy<193>y<200>, and lived earlier than P<193><207>i<207>i ç
(500<MS> B.<|>C.<D>).
It is also in the form of s<220>tras and has eight adhy<193>yas. The ç
topics discussed include the characteristics of technical terms used, ç
sandhis, rules concerning padap<193><219>has, types of svaras and ç
about the letters of the alphabet. Opinions of the ancient teachers ç
like <185><193>kalya, K<193>·yapa and <185><193>ka<219><193>yana are ç
mentioned. Many technical terms used by P<193><207>ini†such as ud<193>tta ç
(level intonation), svarita (higher pitch intonation), <193>mredita ç
(repetition) and lopa (elision)†are already found here.
Even some s<220>tras of this work have been repeated in the A<218><219><193>dhy<193>y<200>.
As regards the S<193>mavedic Pr<193>ti- ·akhyas two treatises are ç
available: the Pu<218>pas<220>tra and the <184>ktantra.
The former is the composition of thesage Pu<218>pa. It has ten prap<193><219>hakas ç
or chapters. Up<193>dhy<193>ya Aj<193>ta·atru has written a bh<193><218>ya ç
on it. It deals mainly with the stobhas (musical interjections like ç
`h<193> u,' `h<193> i,' `hum,' `ho', `oh<193>' and so on, interpolated ç
into a s<193>man) giving all the details connected with them.
The  <184>ktantra  belongs  to  the Kauthuma·<193>kh<193> of S<193>maveda. ç
There are 287 s<220>tras in five prap<193><219>hakas or sections. ç
<185><193>ka<219><193>yana is its author. He precedes Y<193>ska and ç
P<193><207>in<200> since the latter authors have mentioned him.
It deals mainly with the origin of the letters of the alphabet, their ç
varieties as also some technical terms. The places of production of ç
the letters in the mouth and sandhis have also been touched upon. ç
For the Atharvaveda, only one treatise is available now. It is the ç
<185>aunak<200>yacatura-dhy<193>yik<193>. It leans more towards ç
grammar than intonation and other details.

a thing is also considered as a pad<193>rtha or category.
In a particular place (which is empty) there is no gha<219>a or pot. ç
Hence we should accept that there is the abh<193>va (non- existence) ç
of the gha<219>a. The opposite of this gha<219><193>bh<193>va (absence ç
of the pot) isthe pot, which is brought and kept there. Once this ç

power to know and act). This is known from the scriptures and the ç
teachings of the spiritual preceptors.
Keeping this in mind, when the s<193>dhaka (one who is practising ç

If abhiv<193>dana or bowing down to elders and superiors is obligatory ç
for the youngsters and inferiors, it is equally obligatory for the ç
latter to respond to it appropriately. This response is called pratyabhiv<193>da.
This generally takes the form of a blessing like `<193>yu<218>m<193>n ç
bhava' (`May you live long!'), `saubh<193>gyavat<200> bhava' ([To ç
a woman] `May you remain dear to your husband!'). The name of the ç
person is also added at the end and the last vowel is lengthened to ç
pluta (three m<193>tras). For instance: `<193>yu<218>m<193>n bhava ç
devadatt<193>3.'
It is interesting to note that social hierarchies are meticulously ç
kept up in this act, the way of response being dependent upon the ç
social status of the respondent vis-a-vis the person who bows down ç
first.

This is a technical word used in two senses.
In logic, it is used in the sense of re-asserting the pratij<210><193> ç
or the original statement when the same is doubted or objected to.
In the dharma·<193>stras it is used to indicate a substitute when ç
the original rite cannot be done. For instance, when a particular ç
expiation cannot be performed by the transgressor, another†a simpler ç
or easier one†is prescribed. If the sinner is unable to donate a cow ç
as expiation for a sin, he is permitted to pay some gold coins as ç
prescribed. This is called praty<193>mn<193>ya.
@NT = pratyavaroha<207>a
@N1 = (`re-descent')
India possesses more varieties of serpents than any single country ç
in the world.
Serpent-worship, which is common even today, must have arisen from ç
the fear entertained about the deadly effects of snakebites. Hence, ç
the serpent-cult (n<193>gap<220>j<193> and n<193>gabali) here may ç
be considered as very ancient.
The dangers posed by snakes get intensified during the rainy season ç
since their places of dwelling get drowned under water.
To ward off the dangers, the rite of offering a bali (oblation or ç
a sacrifice) to serpents was performed on the <185>r<193>va<207>a-p<220>r<207>im<193> ç
day (full-moon day in the month of <185>r<193>va<207>a, generally ç

December).
Till this day, people were using (or advised to use) cots or some ç
high furniture (inaccessible to snakes) which they wereexpected to ç
discard now, get down (= pratyavaroha<207>a) and sleep on the ground!

Prav<193>ha<207>a, the son of Jaivala†hence called Prav<193>ha<207>a ç
Jaivali†was the king of P<193><210>c<193>la. He was once holding a ç
big meeting of scholars. <185>vetaketu, the son of Gautama °ru<207>i, ç
arrived there with a view to taking part in the philosophical disputations ç
and earn some wealth and fame. However, he was unable to answer even ç
one of the five questions put to him by the king. Feeling disgraced, ç
he returned home and took his father to task for not having taught ç
this science that could have helped him to answer these questions. ç
Since Gautama too did not know it, he went in all humility to the ç
king Prav<193>ha<207>a Jaivali and learnt it from him.
This story appears in both the Ch<193>ndogya (5.3) and the B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka ç
(6.2) Upani<218>ads.
In the first chapter of the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad (1.8.1-8) ç
also there appears one Prav<193>ha<207>a Jaivali, one of the three ç
who had assembled to discuss about the udg<200>tha (a part of s<193>man ç
or S<193>maveda mantra). He proves his superiority over the others.
@NID = <+>   In the Jaimin<200>ya Upani<218>ad Br<193>hma<207>a (1.38.4) ç

@NT = Pravargya
It is a Vedic sacrificial rite. Though considered as an independent ç
rite, it is actually incorporated in the Somay<193>gas like the Agni<218><219>oma. ç
It is generally performed twice a day for three days.
An important item of this sacrifice is the preparation of gharma (hot ç
milk mixed with boiling ghee) out of the milk of a cow and a she-goat, ç
along with ghee.
The offerings of gharma are made through fire to the deities A·vins, ç
V<193>yu, Indra, Savit<216>, B<216>haspati and Yama.
The sacrificer drinks the remainder from the upayaman<200> (the supporting ç
ladle used in the oblations).
During the performance of the Pravargya rite, the doors of the pr<193>c<200>na-va<221>·a ç
or the sacrificial shed are kept closed.
@NT = Pray<193>ga
@N1 = (`[place of] excellent sacrifice')
Visiting places of pilgrimage†especially the important ones†at least ç
once in life-time, has been prescribed as a sacred duty for every ç
Hindu by the dharma·<193>stras and the pur<193><207>as.
One of the very few pilgrim centres, a visit to which has been considered ç
extremely auspicious, is Pray<193>ga (the modern Allahabad in Uttar ç
Pradesh). It has been designated as `T<200>rthar<193>ja' (`the king ç
of pilgrimage centres') also. Since the three rivers Ga<209>g<193>, ç
Yamun<193> and Sarasvat<200> (the mythical river supposed to join ç
the other two from underground) merge here, the place is also called ç
`Trive<207><200>'. The actual confluence is known as Trive<207><200> ç
sa<209>gama and is 2.4 kms. (1.5 miles) from the city.
Brahm<193> (the four-faced creator of the world) is said to have performed ç
a y<193>ga or sacrifice here, which was the best (=pra or prak<216><218><219>a) ç
of all sacrifices. Hence the name Pray<193>ga.
Sometimes it is described as the madhyavedi, the middle altar, out ç
of the five used by Brahm<193>, the other four being Kuruk<218>etra ç
(in Haryana), Gay<193> (in Bihar), Viraj<193> (somewhere in South ç
India) and Pu<218>kara (in Rajasthan).
Some  of  the  pur<193><207>as  like  the Matsya (3.4-10) declare ç
that Pray<193>ga is not destroyed even in pralaya or dissolution ç
of the world.
The hoary antiquity of Pray<193>ga seems to be confirmed by a verse ç
in the <184>gveda itself (10.75, the khila part), (See <MS>KHILA<D> ç
also.) though the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a (2. 54.6) refers to a forest ç
at the place of the confluence of the two rivers.
Religious rites strongly recommended to be performed here are: bath ç
at the Trive<207><200>-sa<209>gama, tonsure of the head (sometimes ç
recommended even for women as pr<193>ya·citta or expiation), performance ç
of ·r<193>ddha to ancestors and d<193>na (giving gifts).
Ve<207><200>prad<193>na (offering two to four inches of their braid ç
of hair into the confluence, by married women) is another rite which ç
is popular among the pilgrims even today.
One of the best places prescribed for committing religious suicide ç
(by persons who have realised the Self or who are very old or who ç
are suffering from incurable diseases causing much suffering and so ç
on) is Pray<193>ga. It is done by jumping into the river from the ç
Ak<218>aya-va<219>a, the famous (and age-old) Banyan tree on its bank.
A bath in the Trive<207><200>, in the month of M<193>gha (generally ç
in January), is considered as extremely auspicious. During this period, ç
many pilgrims assemble on the banks of the rivers and camp there, ç
sometimes for three to four weeks.
@SPACE1 = 
It is again during this month, once in twelve years, that the famous ç
Kumbha-mel<193> festival is held here. (See <MS>KUMBHA-MEL°.<D>) It ç
is the biggest religious festival in the world, drawing more than ç
thirty million people, including thousands of s<193>dhus (religious ç
mendicants and leaders) who all manage a dip in the rivers within ç
the time span of twenty four hours!
Other holy places here that are visited by the pilgrims are: Ve<207><200>m<193>dhava ç
temple, Bharadv<193>j<193>·rama, N<193>gamandira (or V<193>sukimandira) ç

Sin and its expiation is one of the important subjects discussed by ç

The general name for an expiation is `pr<193>ya·citta'. It is defined ç
in various ways:
1)<+>A firm resolve (citta) to undergo tapas or austerity (pr<193>ya).
2)<+>Purification (citta) from the effects of sins (= pr<193>ya).

(Poa cynosuroides) and one large pi<207><195>a (rice-ball) is also ç
to be offered on ku·a grass everyday for ten days.
The word is also used to indicate a ghost, generally the spirit of ç
a great sinner. Such ghosts, called bh<220>tas, pretas and pi·<193>cas, ç
are supposed to be in the retinue of the deities Rudra and K<193>l<200>.

death, the destruction of which is the final goal of life. This is ç
called mok<218>a or liberation.
How a man is reborn is described interestingly by some Upani<218>ads ç

Preyas is that which attracts us even at first sight, because it can ç

The Ka<219>hopani<218>ad (2.1 and 2) states that ·reyas (the good) ç
and preyas (the pleasant), both approach a human being, requesting ç
him as it were, to accept them. However, a man of wisdom after properly ç
discriminating the relative merits of both, accepts the former and ç
rejects the latter.
The B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka Upani<218>ad (1.4.8) uses the word ç

sprinkled with curdled milk.
The details of its preparation and use are generally dealt with in ç
the <185>rauta- s<220>tras (vide °pastamba <185>rautas<220>tras ç

@NT = P<216>thu
The king Vena of the S<220>ryava<221>·a or the solar race was an atheist ç
and an inveterate sinner. Hence the sages killed him by the power ç
of their tapas or austerity and created the king P<216>thu out of ç
his dead body, also by using the same power.
P<216>thu was crowned as the emperor of the whole earth. He was the ç
first king who organised a State and a government.
After he became the emperor, the people of the earth who had been ç
famished approached him for food. When he learnt that the earth had ç
been swallowing all the seeds sown, instead of allowing them to grow ç
(being angry with the evil people then living on earth), he was about ç
to attack it and punish it.
The earth however, appeared before him in the form of a cow, apologised ç
and requested him to milk her and get whatever he wanted.
P<216>thu as also the sages and others† like the <216><218>is (sages), ç
devas (gods), daityas (demons),  gandharvas  (demigods)  and others†`milked' ç
her and got whatever theywanted. The `milk' thus got was: agricultural ç
crops, Vedas, soma juice, strength, alchoholic drinks, music, offerings ç
fit for ·r<193>ddha ceremonies, yogic powers and so on.
In other words, the earth (or thecreated world) gave all things to ç
all persons!
From that day the earth came to be known as P<216>thv<200> or P<216>thiv<200>, ç
the daughter of the emperor P<216>thu.
Other achievements of P<216>thu were: making the uneven earth into ç
a plane ground, creation of villages and towns withall the facilities ç
for civilised living, protection from fears and dangers, as also the ç
performance of many Vedic sacrifices.
His hundredth A·vamedha sacrifice was disrupted by Indra, the king ç
of gods in heaven. Hence he got angry and was about to destroy him ç
(Indra) when Brahm<193> (the four-faced creator) appeared and brought ç
about a reconciliation between them. Lord Vi<218><207>u also appeared ç
in hisY<193>ga·<193>l<193> (sacrificial shed) and was worshipped ç
by him.
After giving suitable advice to his subjects and receiving spiritual ç
instructions from the great sage Sanatkum<193>ra, P<216>thu coronated ç
his eldest son Vijit<193>·va as the next king. Then he retired to ç
the forest along with his queen Arci, performed tapas or austerities, ç
ultimately attaining the highest divine world.
This story of P<216>thu is given in detail in the Bh<193>gavata ç
(4.15-23) and in the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a (1.13).

are those installed in temples. They are usually made of stone and ç

@NT = Pulastya
@SPACE = 
One of the problems we come across in Hindu mythological literature ç
is the names of the <216><218>is or the sages. Whereas there can be ç
several sages of the same name, living at different periods of time, ç
the same sage can also have several names. One such enigma is that ç
of the sage Pulastya.
The information gathered about himfrom various sources like the epics ç
and the pur<193><207>as may be summarised as follows:
He was one of the m<193>nasaputras† mind-born sons†of the creator ç
Brahm<193>. He was also one of the great sages in the group of Saptar<218>is ç
(the Seven Sages).
He had several wives: Go, Havirbhuk, Ilabil<193>, Pr<200>ti, Sandhy<193> ç
and Prat<200>cy<193>.
It is likely that some of these names may refer to the same woman.
Vi·ravas, the father of R<193>va<207>a andhis brothers, as also Kubera, ç
was Pulastya's son.
Once R<193>va<207>a was imprisoned by K<193>rtav<200>ry<193>rjuna, ç
a mighty king. Pulastya had to intercede on his behalf and get him ç
released.
It was Pulastya who inspired the sage Par<193>·ara to compose the ç
famous Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a.
Once Par<193>·ara started a sacrifice to destroy all the r<193>k<218>asas ç
since one of them (Kalm<193><218>ap<193>da) had killed his father ç
<185>akti, the son of Vasi<218><219>ha. But Pulastya successfully ç
persuaded him to give it up.
Bh<200><218>ma, the grandsire of the P<193><207><195>avas and the ç
Kauravas, learnt about the greatness of many places of pilgrimage, ç
from the sage Pulastya.

@SPACE1 = 
Pu<221>savana is one of the minor rites included in the group of <218>o<195>a·asa<221>sk<193>ras ç
(sixteen purificatory rites). It is a rite performed on the pregnant ç
wife to ensure the birth of a male offspring.
The desire for male children and prayers for the same seem to have ç
been quite common in ancient India as in other countries of the world. ç
The Atharvaveda (3.23.3.3) and the S<193>maveda-mantra-br<193>hma<207>a ç
(1.4.8 and 9) contain such prayers.
The time for the performance varied from the third to the eighth month ç
of pregnancy.
As regards its performance†whether to be done only for the first pregnancy ç
or for every one†there seem to be differences of opinion.
The actual rite is as follows: The wife has to fast for three days ç
and then partake a meal of curds mixed with two beans and barley, ç
given by her husband.
Another aspect of the rite is inserting three or four drops of a juice ç
prepared out of a banyan shoot, crushed with milk in the right nostril. ç
This is supposed to prevent abortion, and also ensure the birth of ç
a male child. Generally the mantras chanted during this rite are from ç
the <184>gveda (1.1.3; 3.4.9; 9.3.9). They express a desire to have ç
a good and great son.
Sometimes, a homa is also performed during this rite.

@N1 = (`reinstallation [of Vedic fires]')
@SPACE1 = 
During the Vedic and the epic periods, many dvijas (the twice-born ç
class or the members of the first three var<207>as) used to establish ç
the Vedic fires for regular oblations and special sacrifices.
If the Vedic fires got extinguished due to certain contingencies like ç
illness, loss of wealth, death of near and dear ones or harassment ç
by enemies or even by accident, they could be rekindled or reinstated. ç
This process was known as punar<193>dheya or punar<193>dh<193>na.
The procedure was essentially the same as for agny<193>dh<193>na (See ç
<MS>AGNY°DH°NA<D> for details.), but with a few differences like feeding ç
the fire with ku·a grass (Poacynosuroides) instead of samidh (fuel ç
sticks) and offerings to Agni alone, instead of Agni and Soma.
In case both the g<193>rhapatya and the <193>havan<200>ya fires had ç
been extinguished, punar<193>dheya was considered a pr<193>ya·citta ç
or expiation for the sin also.
