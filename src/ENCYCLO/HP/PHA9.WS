@NT = punarbh<220>
@N1 = (`[a woman who has] married again')
Remarriage of widows seems to have been permitted in the ancient days ç
under certain conditions. Such a woman was known as `punarbh<220>'.
A punarbh<220> was of three kinds:
1. A maiden whose marriage was not consummated and whose husband died ç
suddenly. 2. A woman accused of adultery but returned to her parents ç
who gave her in marriage to another man. 3. A widow remarried to a ç
close relative of her husband. (Whether she was childless or not, ç
is not clear in this case.)
A married woman was permitted to remarry by some dharma·<193>stras ç
under the following conditions:
When a husband dies very early or is lost or unheard of for a long ç
time; if he becomes a sa<221>ny<193>sin (monk); if he isimpotent ç
or suffering from incurable diseases or a sinner.
Though remarriage was perhaps permitted in the earliest age (vide ç
<184>gveda 10.18.7 and 8; Atharvaveda 5.17.8 and 9), during the ç
later period, more stringent rules were imposed for the same. Some ç
of the sm<216>tis even frowned upon the custom (vide Manusm<216>ti ç
9.47; 8.226). Insistence on chastity and the social implications like ç
maidens not getting good husbands may be one of the reasons for the ç
hardening of this stand.
@NT = punarjanma
@N1 = (`rebirth')
The theory of karma and punarjanma or rebirth, is a basic tenet of ç
Hinduism. The principle behind it is, `As you sow, so you reap'. Punarjanma ç
is regulated by pr<193>rabdhakarma. See <MS>PR°RABDHAKARMA<D> for ç
details.
Hinduism accepts the regression of a soul into animal bodies, but ç
only to exhaust the bad karmas, before being born again in a human ç
body.
@NT = Punarvasu
@N1KERN = (`fresh wealth' or `new growth')
This is the seventh out of the twenty- seven nak<218>atras (constellation ç
of stars) accepted by Hindu almanacs and astrologers. The stars of ç
this nak<218>atra are alpha and beta Geminorum.
Caula or tonsure for a male child is to be done in the third year ç
after birth, on a day associated with this nak<218>atra.
It is considered auspicious forother rites also like upanayana and ç
marriage.
@NT = pu<207><195>ra
@N1 = (`religious mark')
Popular Hindu scriptures like the sectarian (minor) Upani<218>ads ç
and the pur<193><207>as ordain that every Hindu must wear a pu<207><195>ra ç
or a religious mark on the forehead as also on other parts of the ç
body.
This pu<207><195>ra may be tiryakpu<207><195>ra (worn crosswise) like ç
the bhasma (or vibh<220>ti) or <220>rdhvapu<207><195>ra like the n<193>ma ç
worn by the Vai<218><207>avas (followers of the Vi<218><207>u sects) ç
or even just a tilaka (circular mark).
See <MS>TIRYAKPUØ£RA<D> and <MS><188>RDHVA-PUØ£RA<D> for details.
@NT = pu<207>ya
@N1 = (`that which purifies')
The words pu<207>ya and p<193>pa are commonly found in the Hindu scriptures. ç
Even the <184>gveda has used the words pu<207>ya (2.43.2) and p<193>pa ç
(10.164.5). So also the Upani<218>ads.
Pu<207>ya refers to the fruit of any goodor meritorious action. Other ç
words considered as its equivalents are: dharma, ·reyas, suk<216>ta ç
and v<216><218>a.
Pu<207>ya gives happiness both here and hereafter.
The most common definition of pu<207>ya is that which causes happiness ç
to others, reducing their problems and difficulties.
The dharma·<193>stras and the pur<193><207>as give detailed descriptions ç
of pu<207>ya and p<193>pa, for the guidance of people in general.
@NT = pu<207>y<193>hav<193>cana
@N1 = (`declaring the day to be auspicious')
Whenever an important religious rite was to be performed, it was a ç
custom in the olden days†which prevails even today †to invite br<193>hma<207>as ç
of erudition and pure character and take their blessings. Such an ç
act was called `pu<207>y<193>hav<193>cana'.
For instance, a person intending to perform the marriage of his daughter, ç
invites such br<193>hma<207>as on an auspicious day, honours them ç
with gandha (sandalwood paste) and t<193>mb<220>la (betel leaves) ç
and declares his wish, with folded hands. The br<193>hma<207>as will ç
respond with the words, `o<221> svasti,' `om pu<207>y<193>ham,' and ç
`om <216>ddhyat<193>m'. Each of these is to be repeated by them thrice. ç
These phrases respectively mean: `May it be auspicious!' `May the ç
day be auspicious!' `May the rite progress well!'
This rite seems to have been observed with regard to the performance ç
of most of the sa<221>sk<193>ras or sacraments.

@SB8.5 = Introduction
@SPACE1 = 
@SPACE1 = 
The Vedas are the basic scriptures of Hinduism. However, modern Hindu ç
religious practices, as they obtain today, are deeply indebted to ç
the pur<193><207>as. Whether it is meditation on God the Absolute, ç
or the queer modes of worship of a grotesque idol of a village deity, ç
everyone of the religious practices of Hinduism finds an honourable ç
place in the pur<193><207>as. This is because they have recognized ç
the need for a variety of approaches to God, to suit the bewildering ç
divergence of human temperaments. If the Hindu society has not been ç
swept off its feet by the incessant invasions of barbarians or the ç
powerful impacts of semitic religions or even the periodic internal ç
upheavals by heretics, it is not a little due to the pur<193><207>as. ç
They have not only prevented it from disintegrating, but, on the other ç
hand, have strengthened it immensely by imparting it a tenacious resilience, ç
rarely seen in human history. This, they have done, not by adopting ç
a tough and dogmatic approach, but bymaking various internal adjustments, ç
keeping however, the core of the religion intact.
There is an additional reason as to why the pur<193><207>as have become ç
the saviours of Hinduism. It is because they have encompassed all ç
aspects of human life, whether sacred or secular. This has naturally ç
made them grow to encyclopaedic proportions. At a time when the only ç
access to knowledge for the common masses was by listening to the ç
pur<193><207>as, they have discharged their duties to the society ç
admirably well.
@SB8.5 = Antiquity of the Pur<193><207>as
The  word  `pur<193><207>a'  is  generally derived  in  two  ways:  pur<193>  bhava<221> ç
(`ancient narratives') and pur<193> api navam (`that which was new ç
even in the ancient days'). Hence, the pur<193><207>as can be defined ç
as narratives belonging to the ancient period, and yet, containing ç
materials relevant to all ages, and so, `ever new and fresh'. Actually, ç
the pur<193><207>as are of great antiquity. The word `pur<193><207>a'†sometimes ç
in association with the word `itih<193>sa' (epic)†occurs in other ç
ancient works like the Atharvaveda and the <185>atapatha Br<193>hma<207>a ç
as also in some older Upani<218>ads like the B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka ç
and the Ch<193>ndogya. Attributing the origin of the pur<193><207>as ç
to Mah<193>bh<220>ta (`the Great Being' or God) or to Brahm<193> (the ç
Creator), and their close association with the Vedic sacrifices as ç
`akhy<193>nabh<193>ga' or narrative portion leads us to believe that ç
they are as old as the Vedas, or perhaps, older still. This is corroborated ç
by the fact that the kings Divod<193>sa, Sud<193>sa, Somaka and others ç
known to the <184>gveda have been placed very low in the genealogical ç
lists given in the pur<193><207>as. Of course, by the word `pur<193><207>a,' ç
the extant class of literature known to us as the pur<193><207>as, ç
is not meant, but only ancient stories and legends. They are often ç
indicated by the words `pur<193><207>a' or `pur<193><207>asa<221>hit<193>'.
@SB8.5 = General Characteristics of the Pur<193><207>as
A pur<193><207>a is defined as a work having five characteristics ç
describing: sarga (creation), pratisarga (intermediate creation), ç
va<221>·a (dynasties of gods and of the patriarchs),  manvantara  (the  fourteen ç
Manus and their periods) and va<221>·<193>nucarita (genealogy of the ç
kings of the solar and the lunar race). Sometimes a few more are added ç
such asrak<218><193> (protection of the world by theavat<193>ras ç
or incarnations), sa<221>sth<193> (pralaya or dissolution of the world), ç
hetu (the cause of creation viz., the j<200>va and its karma), v<216>tti ç
(modes of subsistence) and ap<193>·raya (the refuge or Brahman).
Except the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a, none of the others exhibits ç
all the five characteristics. On the other hand, many other subjects ç
like ·r<193>ddha (obsequial rites), duties of the var<207>as and the ç
<193>·ramas, d<193>nas (gifts), t<200>rthas (places of pilgrimage), ç
and images and their worship find a prominent place in the pur<193><207>as. ç
Quite a few pur<193><207>as contain a lot of material aimed at the ç
propagation of a particular cult (e.g., <185>aivism or Vai<218><207>avism). ç
A lot of information regarding other areas†mostly secular †of knowledge ç
like °yurveda (the science of health), architecture and town-planning, ç
prognostication through omens and astro-logy is also found in the ç
pur<193><207>as since they were the sole means of educating the masses ç
during those days.
@SB8.5 = Evolution of the Pur<193><207>as
Though it is conceded that the pur<193><207>as are of hoary antiquity, ç
extreme paucity of information leaves us in complete darkness with ç
regard to their character or contents, none of which seems to have ç
come down to us in the original form. No doubt Hindu tradition attributes ç
the authorship of these pur<193><207>as†the eighteen Mah<193>pur<193><207>as ç
(the main pur<193><207>as) and the eighteen Upapur<193><207>as (the ç
subsidiary pur<193><207>as)†to the sage K<216><218><207>a Dvaip<193>yana, ç
better known as Vedavy<193>sa or Vy<193>sa. However, this cannot be ç
substantiated by the evidence available. The original pur<193><207>a ç
referred to in the Vedic and allied literature was, perhaps, a conglomeration ç
of <193>khy<193>nas (tales), up<193>khy<193>nas (anecdotes), g<193>th<193>s ç
(metrical songs or proverbial sayings current in the ancient society) ç
and Kalpako<219>is (sayings that had come down through the ages). ç
The sage Vedavy<193>sa might have compiled these into one Pur<193><207>asa<221>hit<193>. ç
His disciples and their disciples as also others in that tradition ç
might have composed more detailed works which gradually took the present ç
form, the eighteen pur<193><207>as as we know them today. This surmise ç
is confirmed by the accounts given in some of the more ancient pur<193><207>as ç
like the V<193>yupur<193><207>a, the Brahm<193><207><195>apur<193><207>a ç
and the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a. According to them, after compiling ç
the original Pur<193><207>asa<221>hit<193>, Vy<193>sa imparted it ç
to his disciple S<220>ta Romahar<218>a<207>a (also spelt as Lomahar<218>a<207>a), ç
who in his turn made it into six versions and taught them to his six ç
disciples. Of these, three disciples viz., K<193>·yapa, S<193>var<207>i ç
and <185><193><221>sap<193>yana made three separate sa<221>hit<193>s ç
which were named after them. These three, along with that of Romahar<218>a<207>a, ç
are known as `m<220>lasa<221>hit<193>s'. The later pur<193><207>as ç
were evolved out of these.
@SB8.5 = Growth of the Present Mah<193>pur<193><207>as
When exactly the original pur<193>nic material began to give rise ç
to different pur<193><207>asa<221>hit<193>s, it is difficult to say. ç
Since the Taittir<200>ya °ra<207>yaka as also the law-books of Manu ç
and Y<193>j<210>avalkya have used the word `pur<193><207><193>ni' ç
(the `pur<193><207>as,' in plural number) it cannot be denied that ç
three or more pur<193><207>as had come into existence long before ç
the beginning of the Christian era. By the time of °pastamba (450-350 ç
<MS>B.C.<D>) the term `pur<193><207>a' had already become restricted ç
to designate a particular class of books. It is not known how many ç
pur<193><207>as existed during °pastamba's time and how they went ç
on growing in number. But we do find a tradition recorded in almost ç
all the extant pur<193><207>as and other allied works, that the pur<193><207>as, ç
or rather the Mah<193>pur<193><207>as, are eighteen in number. The ç
names of these eighteen pur<193><207>as as given in different pur<193><207>ic ç
works, are more or less the same as those of the works now extant ç
under the general title `Mah<193>pur<193><207>a'. Based on the evidence ç
of the Matsya and the K<220>rma pur<193><207>as as also some other ç
Sanskrit works, we can safely assume that by <MS>A.D.<D> 700, the ç
evolution into eighteen Mah<193>-pur<193><207>as had become complete ç
and the number got rigidly fixed there.
The following table gives an idea of these eighteen Mah<193>pur<193><207>as ç
as known to us now:

A brief survey of the contents of these eighteen pur<193><207>as, ç
traditionally called the Mah<193>pur<193><207>as, may now be taken ç
up here.
@S10N = AGNIPUR°ØA
Agni, the god of fire, is said to have communicated this pur<193><207>a ç
to the sage Vasi<218><219>ha. Though it is essentially a ·aivite work, ç
a large part of it has been devoted to the cult of Vi<218><207>u also, ç
especially to the description of his incarnations as R<193>ma and ç
K<216><218><207>a.
The contents of this pur<193><207>a are of an encyclopaedic character. ç
Some of the subjects dealt with are: the ten incarnations of Vi<218><207>u, ç
the stories of R<193>m<193>ya<207>a and Mah<193>bh<193>rata, rules ç
regarding the worship of various deities, installation of images in ç
temples, astrology, architecture and sculpture, the science of medicine, ç
toxicology,  principles  of  dramaturgy, human physiology, figures ç
of speech and so on.
@S10N = BH°GAVATAPUR°ØA
By far, the most well-known of all the pur<193><207>as, the Bh<193>gavata, ç
also called Sr<200>mad Bh<193>gavata, is considered as the most ç
authoritative text dealing with <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a's life ç
and doings. The book, however, deals extensively with the stories ç
of other incarnations of Vi<218><207>u also. The work is in the form ç
of a narration by the young sage <185>uka (son of Vy<193>sa) to the ç
king Par<200>k<218>it, at his request to listen to the glories of ç
Lord K<216><218><207>a-V<193>sudeva. This pur<193><207>a deals with ç
the following topics: story of the king Par<200>k<218>it and the beginning ç
of the narration of the Bh<193>gavata; the cosmic form of God and ç
creation of the world; curse incurred by Jaya and Vijaya, the attendants ç
of Lord Vi<218><207>u as also the story of Hira<207>yaka·ipu and the ç
child-devotee Prahl<193>da; story of the great sage Kapila; story ç
of the destruction ofDak<218>a's sacrifice by Rudra; story of another ç
child-devotee Dhruva; story of Ja<195>abharata; the descent of the ç
river Ga<209>g<193> to the earth; the destruction of Tripura or the ç
three cities by <185>iva; the story of the churning of the ocean and ç
of V<193>mana.
The tenth book contains the story of <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a ç
in detail. The eleventh book contains the famous Uddhavag<200>t<193>. ç
The work ends with a long list of the kings that ruled after K<216><218><207>a's ç
ascension and a graphic description of Kaliyuga, the age in which ç
we are now living.
The Bh<193>gavata has many Sanskrit commentaries which are very ç
useful in understanding it.
@S10N = BHAVI<186>YAPUR°ØA
The printed texts of this pur<193><207>a comprise two parts: P<220>rv<193>rdha ç
and Utta-r<193>rdha. However, many scholars consider the latter half ç
as an independent treatise and call it as Bhavi<218>yottarapur<193><207>a.
The Bhavi<218>yapur<193><207>a is a veritable storehouse of several ç
topics normally dealt with in the dharma·<193>stras. The following ç
is the list of some selected topics: the sixteen sa<221>sk<193>ras ç
or sacraments like n<193>makara<207>a and upanayana; rules concerning ç
the study of the Vedas; some aspects of var<207><193>·rama-dharma; ç
a good number of vratas or religious observances slated for certain ç
days; snakes and their worship; praise and worship of S<220>rya, the ç
sun-god; creation of this world and a description of this earth; several ç
types of d<193>na or giving gifts ceremonially; description of good ç
conduct.
A very interesting aspect of this pur<193><207>a is the bringing of ç
the Maga br<193>hma<207>as from the <185><193>kadv<200>pa into our ç
country by S<193>mba, son of <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a and getting ç
them settled on the banks of the river Candrabh<193>g<193>. They were ç
Zoroastrians from Persia. They gradually integrated themselves into ç
the Hindu society. Sun-worship in India got a boost because of them.
This pur<193><207>a has been called Bhavi<218>yapur<193><207>a, ç
pur<193><207>a predicting future events, probably because it gives ç
the genealogy of the kings who will come in future and the way they ç
rule the country.
@S10N = BRAHMAPUR°ØA
The Brahmapur<193><207>a that is now available in print, seems to ç
be more a compilation of chapters taken from some other works like ç
the Mah<193>bh<193>rata, Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a, M<193>rka<207><195>eyapur<193><207>a ç
and V<193>yupur<193><207>a, though it does contain original material ç
also, dealing chiefly with the praise of the shrines and holy places ç
in the Puru<218>ottama-k<218>etra (Puri in Orissa), Ko<207>arka (Kon<193>rak), ç
Ek<193>mra-k<218>etra (Bhubaneswar) and others.
Its contents may be summarised as follows: creation of the world including ç
the gods and human beings; geographical details of this world as comprising ç
the seven dv<200>pas or island-continents; the story of Dak<218>a's ç
sacrifice; descriptions of some well-known places of pilgrimage; detailed ç
treatment of the Puru<218>ottama-k<218>etra, including the temple ç
of Jagann<193>tha and itsimages; descent of the river Ga<209>g<193>; ç
descriptions of several other holy places; story of <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a ç
in detail; descriptions of some avat<193>ras of Vi<218><207>u like ç
Var<193>ha and Narasi<221>ha; the paths of S<193><209>khya and Yoga.

·<193>kh<193>s. The third section deals with all aspects of ·r<193>ddha ç
(after-death rites), of Para·ur<193>ma's exploits, descent of Ga<209>g<193> ç
by the efforts of Bhag<200>ratha, the story of Dhanvantari receiving ç
the °yurveda (the science of health and longevity) and so on.
The fourth section deals with the future Manus, the Kalpa-pralaya ç
(final dissolution at the end of a cycle), a description of the fourteen ç
worlds as also the various types of hells. There is also a beautiful ç
philosophical disquisition of Brahman or Param<193>tman (God) who ç
is beyond all logic and reasoning.
Lalitop<193>khy<193>na contains the famous Lalit<193>sahasran<193>ma, ç
a hymn endowed with mystical powers.
Sometimes<%20>,<%0>the well-known Adhy<193>tma R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
is stated to be a part of this Brahm<193><207><195>apur<193><207>a.
Hundreds of verses of this pur<193><207>a are found in the V<193>yupur<193><207>a ç
also. Hence scholars sometimes surmise that the two pur<193><207>as ç
were originally one†called V<193>yav<200>ya-brahm<193><207><195>a-pur<193><207>a†and ç
might have got separated around <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 400.
A Balineese translation of this pur<193><207>a has been found in the ç
Bali island of Indonesia.
@S10N = BRAHMAVAIVARTAPUR°ØA
The original Brahmavaivartapur<193><207>a might have been a more ç
ancient work† earlier than <MS>A.D.<D> 300†since the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a ç
has mentioned it among the Mah<193>pur<193><207>as. The text now available ç
in print may have been evolved during the period <MS>A. D.<D> 800-1600.
Since the original cause of the universe has been depicted here as ç
a `vivarta' or `appearance' of Brahman, this pur<193><207>a has been ç
designated as Brahmavaivartapur<193><207>a.
The Brahmakha<207><195>a, the first section, traces the evolution ç
of the universe from the four-faced Brahm<193> who is also <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a ç
himself. The Prak<216>tikha<207><195>a, the second, describes the ç
emanations of Durg<193>, Lak<218>m<200>, Sarasvat<200>, S<193>vitr<200> ç
and R<193>dh<193> from the M<220>laprak<216>ti, as per the command ç
of <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a. The Ga<207>e·akha<207><195>a describes ç
in detail, the birth and exploits of Ga<207>e·a and <186>a<207>mukha, ç
the two sons of <185>iva and P<193>rvat<200>. The last section, the ç
<185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a-janmakha<207><195>a deals with the ç
story of <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a and his divine consort R<193>dh<193>. ç
This section is almost as big as the other three sections put together.
A good number of interesting topics have been dealt with in this pur<193><207>a. ç
To mention only a few: °yurveda or the science of health and longevity; ç
the sandhy<193> ritual; importance of ·<193>lagr<193>ma and its worship; ç
description of the Kaliyuga (Iron Age); the merits of taking bath ç
in the Ga<209>g<193> river on auspicious days; greatness of the tulas<200> ç
leaves (holy basil); story of S<193>vitr<200> and Satyav<193>n; story ç
of Manas<193>dev<200>, the goddess of snakes; Durg<193>p<220>j<193>; ç
prognostication through dreams; code of conduct for married women ç
and widows; greatness of Bh<193>ratade·a or India; some instructions ç
regarding building construction.

@SPACE = 
Though some scholars feel that this is a spurious Vai<218><207>ava ç
work, probably composed in the tenth century, it is held in high esteem ç
even now. Its recitation, especially during the performance of the ç
death and after-death ceremonies is consi-dered auspicious, since ç
it deals with the topic of eschatology in great detail.
The number of verses attributed to this pur<193><207>a seems to vary ç
from about 8000 to 19,000.
The name Garu<195>apur<193><207>a has been derived from the fact ç
that it was taught by Lord Vi<218><207>u to his eagle-mount Garu<195>a.
The first part of this work, like the Agnipur<193><207>a, is encyclopaedic ç
in character, dealing with several topics such as the contents of ç
the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a and the Mah<193>bh<193>rata, cosmography, ç
astronomy, astrology, omens and portents, medicine and knowledge of ç
precious stones.
The second part, called Pretakalpa deals in great detail with death, ç
the journey of the j<200>va after death to its next destination, the ç
various rites to be performed at death and after death, torments of ç
hell, encounter with pretas or spirits of the dead, the Yamaloka or ç
the world of Yama (the god of death and hell) and liberation through ç
devotion to Lord Vi<218><207>u.
@S10N = K<188>RMAPUR°ØA
The present K<220>rmapur<193><207>a comprising two parts claims ç
to be the first section †called Br<193>hm<200>sa<221>hit<193>†of ç
a much bigger work consisting of four sa<221>hit<193>s or sections ç
viz., Br<193>hm<200>, Bh<193>gavat<200>, Saur<200> and Vai<218><207>av<200>. ç
However the last three seem to have been lost.
This pur<193><207>a was, perhaps, a p<193><210>ca-r<193>tra work which ç
was later recast by the p<193>·upatas during the eighth century <MS>A.D.<D>
Lord Vi<218><207>u taught this pur<193><207>a in his incarnation as ç
K<220>rma or tortoise, to the sages like N<193>rada. Hence the name ç
K<220>rmapur<193><207>a.
A brief synopsis of the contents may now be presented here: the duties ç
of the four var<207>as and the four <193>·ramas; evolution of the ç
prak<216>ti (primeval nature) into the world; story of Sv<193>yambhuva ç
Manu and his wife <185>atar<220>p<193>; story of Dak<218>a; story ç
of V<193>mana and Bali; genealogies of some <216><218>is and kings; ç
description of the yaduva<221>·a (the lineage of the king Yadu); greatness ç
of K<193>·<200> and Pray<193>ga, the two well-known pilgrim centres; ç
description of the physical features of the world and of Jamb<220>dv<200>pa ç
which contains Bh<193>ratavar<218>a; division of the Vedas; the famous ç
®·varag<200>t<193>; on ·r<193>ddhas or after-death rites; on pr<193>ya·cittas ç
or expiations for sins; pralaya or destruction of the created world.
@S10N = LI<177>GAPUR°ØA
This pur<193><207>a mainly aims at the propagation of the cult of ç
<185>iva and his worship through the li<209>ga, the rounded surface ç
emblem commonly worshipped even now.
It deals with a number of subjects, the more important ones being: ç
the manifestation of the five aspects of <185>iva viz., Sadyoj<193>ta, ç
V<193>madeva, Tatpuru<218>a, Aghora and ®·<193>na; <185>iva appearing ç
as a huge pillar of fire to Brahm<193> and Vi<218><207>u; Vy<193>sa ç
and his disciples; stories of the sages Dadh<200>ci and <185>il<193>da; ç
about the four yugas or epochs; Nandi and his worship; descriptions ç
of the well-known S<220>ryava<221>·a and Candra-va<221>·a, the dynasties ç
originating from thesun and the moon; worship of <185>iva and description ç
of some vratas; detailed accountof the famous <185>ivapa<210>c<193>k<218>ar<200>- ç
mantra and its use in meditation; an account of the places of pilgrimage ç
like K<193>·<200>; on music and its propagation; manifestation of ç
<185>iva in eight forms (a<218><219>a-m<220>rtis); various d<193>nas ç
or gifts and their fruits; how to establish the <185>ivali<209>gas; ç
the m<216>tyu<210>jaya-mantra and its usage.
Several subsidiary religious works lik<W1%23>e<MI%0>Pa<210>c<193>k<218>ara-m<193>h<193>tmya, ç
R<193>masahasra- n<193>ma and Rudr<193>k<218>a-m<193>h<193>tmya ç
have originated from this pur<193><207>a.
@S10N = M°RKAØ£EYAPUR°ØA
This is one of the few pur<193><207>as that have retained much of ç
the more ancient material, composed probably around <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
300.
Though this work is said to contain 9000 verses, the printed texts ç
available now fall short of it by nearly 2000 verses.
The pur<193><207>a starts with the questions posed by Jaimini to the ç
sage M<193>rka<207><195>eya who directs him to the four ca<219>aka ç
birds living in the Vindhy<193>cala range of hills. The birds later ç
on refer to the teachings of M<193>rka<207><195>eya given to Krau<218><219>uki. ç
The well-known and extremely popular work, the Dev<200>m<193>h<193>tmya ç
(also called Ca<207><195><200> and Durg<193>sapta·at<200>), forms ç
an integral part of this pur<193><207>a.
The M<193>rka<207><195>eyapur<193><207>a is remarkably non-sectarian ç
in character. The Vedic deities, Indra, Brahm<193>, Agni and S<220>rya, ç
as also the sun-myths, get greater coverage than Vi<218><207>u or ç
<185>iva. There is a clear trend towards popularising the ·rauta and ç
the sm<193>rta rites which had already begun to be neglected by the ç
people.
Apart from the usual subjects of creation, dissolution, the manvantaras ç
and genealogies, this pur<193><207>a has also dealt with the following ç
topics: legends of Hari·candra, K<193>rtav<200>rya and also of the ç
queen Mad<193>las<193>; descriptions of hell, karma and its fructification; ç
some aspects of yoga; geographical description of Bh<193>rata and ç
·r<193>ddhas.

@SPACE = 
Said to<|>have been taught by Lord Vi<218><207>u in his incarnation ç
as Matsya (orfish), this pur<193><207>a though containing ancient ç
material, seems to be a conglome-ration of chapters taken from various ç
sources, especially the V<193>yu and the Vi<218><207>udharmottara ç
pur<193><207>as. Some scholars feel that it was originally a Vai<218><207>ava ç
work, later on modified by the <185>aivas.
In addition to dealing with the usual topics of the ancient pur<193><207>as ç
like creation, dissolution and genealogies of <216><218>is and kings, ç
this pur<193><207>a contributes substantially to the other areas of ç
knowledge also. Some of the topics delineated are: the stories of ç
Kaca, Devay<193>n<200>, Yay<193>ti and Puru; genealogies of the br<193>hma<207>as ç
who were worshippers of fire; various vratas or religious vows; some ç
d<193>nas or gifts and their fruits; greatness of the holy places ç
Pray<193>ga, V<193>r<193><207>as<200> and the river Narmad<193>; duties ç
of a king; on omens; some aspects of iconography; building construction ç
and so on.
A remarkable feature of this pur<193><207>a is that the last chapter ç
(ch. 290) beautifully summarises all the subjects dealt within it, ç
without omitting any.
@S10N = N°RAD®YAPUR°ØA
The utility of this pur<193><207>a lies in the fact that it gives ç
the synopsis of all the other pur<193><207>as also.
It is in two parts. The first part incorporates the entire work, known ç
as B<216>han-n<193>rad<200>ya-pur<193><207>a. The second part appears ç
more like an independent treatise.
It comprises the teachings given to N<193>rada by Sanaka and others. ç
The subjects touched upon are of a very wide range. They include: ç
the vratas or religious observances of the whole year; devotion to ç
Vi<218><207>u; creation of the world; duties of the people of various ç
var<207>as and <193>·ramas; the six Ved<193><209>gas like vy<193>kara<207>a ç
(grammar),  chandas  (prosody)  and  jyoti<218>a (astronomy); greatness ç
of Pray<193>ga, the famous place of pilgrimage; ritualistic worship; ç
greatness and importance of fasting on ek<193>da·<200> days and so ç
on.
Another remarkable feature of this pur<193><207>a is that it deals ç
with a number of mantras and the methods of repeating them, which ç
is a speciality of the Tantras and the °gamas.
There is one Lalit<193>sahasran<193>ma given in the 89th chapter ç
of the first half. This, however, is entirely different from the one ç
that is now commonly chanted, which is a part of the Brahm<193><207><195>apur<193><207>a.
@S10N = PADMAPUR°ØA
This is a voluminous work in fiveparts: S<216><218><219>ikha<207><195>a, ç
Bh<220>mikha<207><195>a, Svargakha<207><195>a, P<193>t<193>lakha<207><195>a ç
and Uttara-kha<207><195>a.
Primarily a scripture of the Vai<218><207>a-vas, it has two distinct ç
recensions†the Bengal and the South-Indian. It is only the latter ç
that is available in print.
Like some of the other pur<193><207>as this one also deals with a ç
variety of subjects, only a few of which may be mentioned here: stories ç
of Brahm<193>'s sacrifice; legends connected with the sage Dadh<200>ci, ç
V<216>tra, Nahu<218>a, Yay<193>ti, <185>akuntal<193> and others; greatness ç
of sacred rivers like Ga<209>g<193> and holy places like Pray<193>ga, ç
K<193>·<200> and Gay<193>; description of the various worlds of goblins, ç
gandharvas, heaven and so on; var<207><193>·rama-dharmas; vratas or ç
religious vows; ·r<193>ddhas of various types; ritualistic worship ç
of Vi<218><207>u and <185>iva; importance of Sahasran<193>mas as those ç
of Vi<218><207>u and R<193>ma; karma and its result.
It is obvious that it contains compositions of various persons written ç
during various periods of time.

Biggest of the extant pur<193><207>as, the Skandapur<193><207>a ç
is found in two forms, one being divided into seven kha<207><195>as ç
and the other into six sa<221>hit<193>s.
The seven kha<207><195>as are: M<193>he·vara-kha<207><195>a, Vai<218><207>avakha<207><195>a, ç
Br<193>hma-kha<207><195>a, K<193>·<200>kha<207><195>a, °vantyakha<207><195>a, ç
N<193>garakha<207><195>a and Prabh<193>sakha<207><195>a. There ç
are 81,000 ·lokas or verses spread over 1671 chapters.
The six sa<221>hit<193>s are: Sanatkum<193>ra-sa<221>hit<193>, S<220>tasa<221>hit<193>, ç
<185>a<209>karasa<221>hit<193>, Vai<218><207>avasa<221>hit<193>, Br<193>hmasa<221>hit<193> ç
and Saurasa<221>hit<193>. The total number of verses in this series ç
also comes to 81,000.
Of these, only the first three sa<221>hit<193>s are available now ç
in print, whereas all the seven kha<207><195>as of the former have ç
been printed.
This pur<193><207>a is said to have been taught by <185>iva to P<193>rvat<200>, ç
P<193>rvat<200> to Skanda (<186>a<207>mukha or K<193>rttikeya or Subrahma<207>ya), ç
Skanda to Nandi, Nandi to Atri and Atri to Vy<193>sa.
The number of subjects dealt with in this work is legion. It contains ç
numerous up<193>khy<193>nas or stories, detailed descriptions of several ç
places of pilgrimage of which K<193>·<200>, Pur<200> and Ujjayin<200> ç
get the pride of place, Advaita Ved<193>nta, various aspects of Lord ç
<185>iva, his li<209>gas and methods of meditation as also worship ç
and var<207><193>·rama-dharmas. Another interesting feature is the ç
geographical details it gives, of ancient India. The Satyan<193>r<193>ya<207>a-vrata ç
which is very common and popular now, gets a prominent place in the ç
Rev<193>kha<207><195>a part of the °vantyakha<207><195>a.
This pur<193><207>a has been the source of several minor works like ç

Said to have been taught by the sage Pulastya to N<193>rada, this ç
pur<193><207>a is primarily a Vai<218><207>ava work. Though the ten ç
avat<193>ras of Vi<218><207>u, especially the V<193>ma-n<193>vat<193>ra, ç
get the pride of place, it has liberal views and deals with other ç
deities also such as <185>iva, Ga<207>apati and S<220>rya.
It is stated to consist of two parts, the second part being sometimes ç
called B<216>had-v<193>manapur<193><207>a. Now, only the first part ç
is available in print.
The birth and exploits of Ga<207>e·a and K<193>rttikeya, greatness ç

the Matsyapur<193><207>a. Perhaps this pur<193><207>a was in two ç
parts and only one of them has been recovered so far.
Lord Vi<218><207>u in his incarnation as Var<193>ha (the Boar) is ç
said to have given this teaching to Bh<220>dev<200> (the Earth) at ç
her request.
There are two recensions of this pur<193><207>a: the Gau<195><200>ya ç
and the D<193>k<218>i<207><193>tya. They differ from each other in ç
quite a few places.
This pur<193><207>a deals with most of the general topics of the dharma·<193>stras ç
such as vratas, places of pilgrimage, d<193>na (gifts), images of ç
deities and their worship, a·auca  (ceremonial  impurity),  ·r<193>ddha ç

Whether the V<193>yupur<193><207>a has to be listed among the eighteen ç
Mah<193>pur<193><207>as or the <185>ivapur<193><207>a, has been ç
a moot point. If some scholars opine that the two pur<193><207>as ç
are one and the same called by different names, there are others who ç
feel that the former is a part of the latter. However, all of them ç
agree that the core content of this pur<193><207>a is quite ancient.
It has four sections, designated as `p<193>das', as follows: Prakriy<193>p<193>da, ç
Anu<218>a<209>gap<193>da, Upodgh<193>tap<193>da and Upasa<221>h<193>rap<193>da.
This pur<193><207>a is clearly a ·aiva-p<193>·upata work. Detailed ç
geographical descriptions of places, of manvantaras (or the periods ç
of Manu), the importance and the greatness of Gay<193> (the famous ç
place of pilgrimage), genealogies of some kings and sages, several ç
details of ·r<193>ddha ceremonies and the science of music†are some ç
of the topics dealt with in this pur<193><207>a.
@S10N = VI<186>ØUPUR°ØA
One of the oldest pur<193><207>as, the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a ç
conforms fairly strictly to the characteristics generally ascribed ç
to the pur<193><207>as. Detailed treatment of the vratas or t<200>rthas, ç
which find a prominent place in the other pur<193><207>as, is conspicuous ç
by its absence.
Spread over six sections†called a<221>·as†and written in a mellifluous ç
language, the work deals with the usual topics like creation of this ç
world and of the deities and the manes, the stories of Dhruva, Prahl<193>da, ç
Ja<195>abharata, and <185>r<200> R<193>ma, the Vedas, the four var<207>as ç
and the four <193>·ramas, the impact of Kali (personification of the ç
Iron Age, and of irreligiosity) and so on. The story of <185>r<200> ç
K<216><218><207>a†a precursor to the Bh<193>gavata†is given in detail.
Quite a few philosophical ideas of the Vedas are reflected in this ç
pur<193><207>a. The description of the Kaliyuga, the age in which ç
we are living now, seems to be astonishingly accurate. Though Vi<218><207>u ç
has been given prominence, he is not one of the Trinity, but the origin ç
of all the three, Brahman Himself. Bhakti or devotion has been propagated ç
as the main s<193>dhana or means of attaining liberation. On the whole, ç
it is a highly readable pur<193><207>a which has been quite popular ç
and has attracted the attention of many scholars who have written ç
commentaries on it.
@SB8.5 = Recurrent Topics of the Pur<193><207>as
Though most of the pur<193><207>as are encyclopaedic in character, ç
some subjects, like creation of this world, seem to recur frequently. ç
These subjects may now be taken up for a brief exposition.
@S10N = CREATION
Creation of this world is a topic that often engages the attention ç
of the pur<193><207>as. The Ved<193>ntic doctrine that Brahman, the ç
One without a second, is the ultimate Truth is accepted by all the ç
pur<193><207>as though the sectarian deities like <185>iva or Vi<218><207>u, ç
are sometimes identified with it. Evolution of the world takes place ç
from Prak<216>ti or primeval matter (an aspect of Brahman), the order ç
of evolution being the same as expounded by the S<193><209>khya and ç
the Ved<193>nta philosophies: prak<216>ti-<~>mahat-aha<209>k<193>ra ç
(ego sense), manas (mind), j<210><193>nendriyas (organs of knowledge) ç
and karmendriyas (organs of action) as also the pa<210>cabh<220>tas ç
(the five primordial elements). These, the first evolutes, make up ç
the Brahm<193><207><195>a or the Cosmic Egg, also  called  Hira<207>yagarbha.  Brahman ç
enters into it and causes further evolution right up to a blade of ç
grass, the whole process being guided by the residual karma (or deserts) ç
of the unredeemed j<200>vas (individual souls) carried over from the ç
previous cycle of creation.
@EMERGENCY = Different types and methods of creation are also given ç
in some of the pur<193><207>as.
@EMERGENCY = Creation is accepted to be cyclic (crea- tion-sustenance-destruction-recreation ç
and so on), having no specific beginning orend.
Unlike the world that we see and know, this earth and the galaxies, ç
the creation envisaged by the pur<193><207>as hasfourteen lokas or ç
worlds, seven subterranean and seven above. Unlike in the modern view, ç
again, all the thirteen worlds different from ours, are inhabited ç
by conscious living beings, acclimatised to the particular vibrations ç
of those regions and endowed with suitable sensory receivers.
@S10N = THE EARTH
The paur<193><207>ic geography and astro-nomy are, to say the least, ç
quite enigmatic to the modern mind. An account of this earth, as detailed ç
in some pur<193><207>as like the Bh<193>gavata, depicts it as a ç
circular body, with seven concentric circles or belts called dv<200>pas ç
(continents) arranged one within the other, with oceans of different ç
liquids surrounding each belt like moats. Each continent is described ç
as having its own mountain and river-system. In the central continent ç
called Jamb<220>dv<200>pa, stands Mah<193>meru, the axis of the whole ç
world systems. Along the fringe of the outermost continent runs the ç
Lok<193>loka mountain. The single-wheeled chariot ofS<220>rya (the ç
sun) circles along this mountain, creating day and night.
The whole description is evidently a schematic and symbolic representation ç
for meditative purposes, to draw our attention from the gross to the ç
subtle spirit pervading nature.
@S10N = TIME
Another concept of the pur<193><207>as that boggles our mind is that ç
of time as connected with creation.
Mah<193>vi<218><207>u, the Supreme Being, conducts the work of creation ç
through Brahm<193> the intermediary instrument. A cycle of creation ç
is a day-time of Brahm<193> and of dissolution, his night. This dissolution ç
is `naimittika-pralaya,' quasi-dissolution only, of the worlds up ç
to Satyaloka. They manifest again during the day-time of Brahm<193>. ç
One year of Brahm<193> consists of 360 such days and his life-span ç
is 100 such years. The immensity of this is realised only if it is ç
converted in terms of human years. One year of human beings is one ç
day of the celestials. Twelve-thousand such celestial years form one ç
catur-yuga (the period of four yugas of K<216>ta or Satya, Tret<193>, ç
Dv<193>para and Kali). Two thousand such caturyugas constitute one ç
day, including the night-time, of Brahm<193>. The total duration of ç
Brahm<193>'s lifetime in terms of human years, comes to a little more ç
than three lakh billion years!
Each day-time of Brahm<193> (of one thousand caturyugas) is divided ç
into fourteen Manvantaras or Epochs of Manus or Patriarchs. These ç
Manus†like Sv<193>yam-bhuva, Sv<193>roci<218>a, Auttami and others† ç
maintain the world-order and progress, under the directions of divine ç
incarnations.
Every Manvantara consists of about seventy-six caturyugas, each of ç
which is marked by retrogression from the perfection of the K<216>ta ç
to the degradation of the Kali. The Lord will restore the balance ç
at the end of the Caturyuga.
@S10N = GENEALOGIES
The pur<193><207>as abound in long lists of genealogies of kings and ç
sages. Since some names and their chronological order seem to be common, ç
it may safely be assumed that these ancient personalities did exist. ç
However, the details being scant, they do not enlighten us in any ç
way to know our ancient history.
One of the traits found in these lists is the tendency to trace the ç
different dynasties to a common ancestor, Vaivasvata Manu, son of ç
S<220>rya (sun). Four of his nine sons†Ik<218>v<193>ku, N<193>bh<193>nedi<218><219>ha, ç
<185>ary<193>ti and N<193>bh<193>ga†were responsible for establishing ç
four well-known dynasties: Aik<218>v<193>ku, Vai·<193>la, <185><193>ry<193>ta ç
and R<193>th<200>tara. They were all a part of the S<220>ryava<221>·a ç
or the Solar dynasty. The Candrava<221>·a or the lunar dynasty was ç
founded by Pur<220>ravas Aila.
Then, there are the genealogies of the sages, the Saptar<218>is (Seven ç
Sages) and others, like Gautama, Bharadv<193>ja, Atri, Ka·yapa and ç
so on. These lists are also quite long.
As regards these genealogical lists, this much can be said that they ç
point to the great antiquity of our civilization.
@SB8.5 = <P8.5BI>Pur<193><207>as as Ancient Indian Historical<R>ç
Tradition<P255D>
It is to be kept in mind that the paur<193><207>ic concept of time ç
is cyclic, based on the theory that creation, sustenance and destruction ç
(s<216><218><219>i, sthiti and pralaya) take place in a cyclic order, ç
having no specific beginning or end. Since modern history is based ç
on the linear concept of time, the historical traditions of the pur<193><207>as ç
may appear to be enigmatic.
Events themselves pass away with their occurrence. However, they survive ç
as memories registered in the psyche of the human beings and can stimulate ç
them for creative activities. A chain of such powerful stimulations ç
gets established as a tradition. The pur<193><207>as are repositories ç
of such traditions from the most ancient times. Their utility lies ç
in contributing to the continuity and betterment of the civilisation ç
and culture of a people. Hence, though they may not fit into the frame-work ç
of `history' as defined by the modern man, they cannot be dismissed ç
as fiction either! They were originally based on facts and hence can ç
help us in reconstructing our history. For instance, the lists of ç
the dynasties of kings, though they mention the originators of the ç
dynasties like Ik<218>v<193>ku, also include the dynasties known to ç
the historical period such as <185>i·un<193>gas, Nandas, Mauryas, ç
Guptas, and even the °bh<200>ras, Yavanas and H<220><207>as.
@SB8.5 = Ethics of the Pur<193><207>as
Dharma or duty constitutes the foundation of pur<193><207>ic ethics. ç
It embraces all the factors which contribute to the progress and well-being ç
of the individual, the society and the world at large. These factors ç
include the possession of gu<207>as or virtues and karma or proper ç
discharge of one's duties.
The pur<193><207>as recognize two types of dharmas: s<193>dh<193>ra<207>a ç
or s<193>m<193>nya dharma (generic) and vi·e<218>a dharma or svadharma ç
(specific).
The individual, being an integral part of the society owes a duty ç
to himself and to the society. Since his rise and fall affect the ç
society, he must endeavour to raise himself to the fullest stature.
Hence there is no conflict between the individual and the social duties.
Dharma contributes to the welfare and progress of the human society, ç
nay, of the whole world. In the puru<218><193>rtha scheme of life, ç
dharma occupies the first place. It is the best kith and kin of the ç
embodied soul not only in life, but also after death. It wanes from ç
its full strength in the K<216>tayuga to only a quarter in the Kaliyuga.
The  pur<193><207>as  have  successfully reconciled the s<193>dh<193>ra<207>a-dharmas ç
with svadharma. Whereas the former comprise virtues that impart refinement ç
and culture to an individual, the latter is a practical application ç
of the former within a particular sphere by an individual belonging ç
to a class characterised by certain prominent qualities or gu<207>as. ç
The scheme of var<207>a and <193>·rama dharmas which the pur<193><207>as ç
unanimously advocate, is based upon the duties of the individuals ç
of a class. It aims at material and spiritual perfection of the society ç
as a whole.
The s<193>dh<193>ra<207>a-dharmas are universal in scope and eternal ç
in nature. Though the pur<193><207>as enumerate them generally as ç
ten, a few more virtues are sometimes added, making the list longer. ç
They are: ahi<221>s<193> (non-injury), satya (truthfulness), k<218>am<193> ç
or k<218><193>nti (forbearance), dama or indriyanigraha (self control), ç
·ama (inner peace), day<193> (compassion), d<193>na (charity), ·auca ç
(purity), tapas (austerity) and j<210><193>na (wisdom).
Of these, satya and ahi<221>s<193> are extolled highly. <185>auca ç
(purity), both internal and external, is stressed as an indispensable ç
socio-ethical virtue. Tapas which includes disinterested action is ç
a must for achieving anything great in life. D<193>na is also eulogised ç
much as a social duty.
Coming  to  the  vi·e<218>a-dharmas (svadharma) or var<207><193>·rama-dharmas, ç
the pur<193><207>as deal with them extensively. The var<207>a system ç
represents a natural division of the society based on gu<207>a (nature) ç
and karma (vocation). The <193>·rama scheme of life helps an individual ç
to evolve himself from the stage of a novice in pursuit of learning ç
to the stage of a person ever living in God. Both these systems enjoin ç
upon their individual members certain duties.
@SPACE1 = 
If a br<193>hma<207>a is advised to lead an austere life in pursuit ç
of knowledge and spiritual excellence and give that know-ledge to ç
others, a k<218>attriya is exhorted to protect the society from external ç
aggression and help maintain internal law and order. A vai·ya is to ç
engage himself in the production and distribution of wealth and goods ç
through agriculture, dairy farming and trade. Those incapable of pursuing ç
these three modes of life lived by serving the others and became the ç
·<220>dras.
Coming to the <193>·ramas or the four stages of life, brahmacarya ç
or studenthood comes first. It is the period of study and discipline ç
spent in the house of the guru. Service to the guru is an essential ç
aspect of this life.
G<193>rhasthya or householdership is the next stage of life. Since ç
it offers the largest scope for service and sacrifice, it is considered ç
as the most vital stage. The householder is the refuge and main stay ç
for those in the other three stages of life. Earning his livelihood ç
by right means and performing the pa<210>cayaj<210>as (five daily ç
sacrifices like worship of the gods, study of the Vedas and feeding ç
living beings) form an integral part of his life.
The v<193>naprastha (life of a forest-<~>recluse) is the third stage ç
and is only a preparation for the final stage of renunciation. Simple ç
life and contemplation on God are its essential features.
Sa<221>ny<193>sa (life of a monk) is the last stage where the sa<221>ny<193>sin ç
(monk) has to live a life of total detachment from the world, depending ç
solely on God and ever meditating on him.
@SPACE1 = 
Other ideas that find a place in the pur<193><207>as are the theory ç
of karma and punarjanma (transmigration), pr<193>ya·cittas (expiations ç
for sins), vratas (religious observances) and t<200>rthay<193>tr<193> ç
(pilgrimage).
`As you sow, so you reap' is the principle behind the theory of karma. ç
Since actions always produce their corresponding results, human beings ç
are advised to eschew evil and always do good. Effect of sins committed, ç
knowingly or unknowingly, can be got rid of, or at least minimised, ç
by performing proper expiations prescribed for them.
Vratas or religious observances with their stress on fasting and self-control ç
help in self-purification. So also t<200>rthay<193>tr<193> or visiting ç
places of pilgrimage, associated with gods or saints.
@SB8.5 = Popular Religion in the Pur<193><207>as
The labyrinth of Vedic sacrifices on one side and the uncompromising ç
way of renunciation as taught by the Upani<218>adic sages on the other, ç
both of which were beyond the reach of the common masses, drove the ç
ordinary people, whose hunger for religion was no less sincere, into ç
the arms of Buddhism and Jainism. It was at this juncture that the ç
pur<193><207>as as we know them today, started evolving. The paths ç
of karma and bhakti, with their various ramifications were gradually ç
introduced into them. Over the centuries they have grown both in quantity ç
and in quality, so much so, that they are now the bed-rock of modern ç
Hinduism.
Temples and temple rituals, domestic worship along with the associated ç
religious rites, vratas (religious vows and festivals) and t<200>rthay<193>tr<193> ç
(pilgrimage) invariably find a prominent place in the pur<193><207>as. ç
Sometimes, details of construction of temples and their consecration ç
are also given.
Instructions regarding ritualistic worship, both independently and ç
as a part of the vratas, also find a place. They include aspects of ç
austerity associated with them such as fasting and keeping vigil.
Of the sixteen sa<221>sk<193>ras or sacraments, only ·r<193>ddha (obsequial ç
rites) has been given a pre-eminent place though the others also are ç
dealt with.
Bhakti or devotion to God (especially towards the well-known deities ç
of the Hindu pantheon, including the avat<193>ras or incarnations) ç
is another subject dealt with in great detail in the pur<193><207>as. ç
They extol the extraordinary powers of the mantras (divine names) ç
and have also given substantial information about the science of the ç
mantras (mantra·<193>stra). However, the general trend is always towards ç
stressing the unity of the Godheadand emphasising that the various ç
deities are only its aspects. Vilification of some deities and their ç
followers is an exception and may safely be brushed aside as an aberration ç
or as interpolations by fanatics.
@SB8.5 = Upapur<193><207>as
Though tradition fixed the number of the Mah<193>pur<193><207>as as ç
eighteen, the growth of pur<193><207>a literature went on unabated. ç
Hence those of the pur<193><207>as which did not or could not find ç
a place in that list were accommodated under the title `Upapur<193><207>as'. ç
In course of time the number ofthese Upapur<193><207>as also got ç
fixed at eighteen. They were considered as appendices to the Mah<193>pur<193><207>as ç
and hence of lesser importance. However, quite a few of them are large ç
enough in size and important enough in content, that they compel us ç
to treat them with respect. The number also has exceeded eighteen.
The lists of these Upapur<193><207>as, as given in the various Mah<193>pur<193><207>as ç
do not tally. Some of the pur<193><207>as listed under the Mah<193>pur<193><207>as, ç
as for instance, Brahm<193><207>da or V<193>mana, find a place ç
in the lists of Upapur<193><207>as also. Some of these Upapur<193><207>as ç
are: °di, N<193>rasi<221>ha, K<193>pila, K<193>lik<193>, V<193>ru<207>a, ç
B<216>hannandi, Ek<193>mra, Vi<218><207>udharmottara and Dev<200>-bh<193>gavata.
According to some writers, the Dev<200>bh<193>gavata is the real ç
Bh<193>gavata and not the <185>r<200>mad Bh<193>gavata (or Vi<218><207>u-bh<193>gavata) ç
which is only an Upapur<193><207>a.
The general content of these Upapur<193><207>as is identical with ç
those of the Mah<193>pur<193><207>as. However, they are more sectarian ç
in character interested in propagating their own cults.
@SB8.5 = Conclusion
From this brief survey of the pur<193><207>as it can safely be conceded ç
that they have admirably succeeded in preserving and propagating Hindu ç
religion and culture, especially through the critical periods of our ç
history. Their simple exposition of the Ved<193>ntic principles of ç
philosophy, explanation of the various aspects of dharma (conduct ç
and duties) and inducing people to follow dharma in their life, stress ç
on the performance of svadharma, exhortations as to d<193>na (gifts) ç
and sev<193> (service) to mankind to maintain social balance, advice ç
to keep up religious harmony, their providing simple and popular modes ç
of worship, especially to women and the backward  classes,  have  contributed ç
immensely  to  the  growth  and  the sustenance of the Hindu ethos. ç
A lot of historical facts, though mixed up with myths, contained in ç
them can help us to reconstruct Indian history, freeing it from the ç
distortions and prejudices of the European writers and Anglicised ç
Indians.
They therefore deserve a far more careful study than has hitherto ç
been devoted to them.

@N1 = (`collection of ancient <R>ç

@SPACE1 = 
The pur<193><207>as are extremely popular in the Hindu society even ç
today. Many of the religious rites and practices as also temple rituals ç
are based on, or, connected with, the pur<193><207>as.
The basic material of these pur<193><207>as lies in the g<193>th<193>s ç
(metrical songs or proverbial sayings), <193>khy<193>yik<193>s (ancient ç
tales), up<193>khy<193>nas (anecdotes) and kalpoktis (old sayings), ç
often referred to even in the Vedic literature.
The sage Vy<193>sa is said to have compiled them all into one treatise ç
called the Pur<193><207>asa<221>hit<193>, which became the basic ç
work for the later pur<193><207>as and upapur<193><207>as.

@NT = Purandarad<193>sa
@N1 = (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1484-1564)
@SPACE = 
@SPACE1 = 
The Harid<193>sas of Karnataka have contributed significantly to the ç
Bhakti Movement, the religious movement that chiefly propagated the ç
cult of bhakti or devotion to God, as the best means of spiritual ç
evolution.
Purandarad<193>sa was a pioneer in this field.
His biographical details as have come down to us by oral traditions ç
seem to be more mythical than real or historical. Piecing together ç
all such details as are available now, his life can briefly be stated ç
as follows:
He was born sometime in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1484. His father, Varadappa ç
N<193>yaka, who was a fabulously rich diamond merchant, christened ç
him as <185>r<200>nivasa N<193>yaka and educated him not only in the ç
traditional learning†Sanskrit and scriptures†but also in music and ç
the family occupation.
In course of time he became a fine young man and was married to a ç
pious girl Sarasvat<200> from a decent family. He then took over his ç
father's business and further improved upon it.
In spite of immense wealth he was a miser to the core. He never helped ç
thepeople who were in distress and approached him for assistance. ç
Once a miraculous incident, for which his pious wife was the cause, ç
totally transformed his life. He distributed all his wealth to the ç
needy, became a beggar for the sake of God and approached the great ç
sage Vy<193>sat<200>rtha (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1447-1539) for initiation ç
into spiritual life. The sage readily obliged and gave him the new ç
name Purandara-d<193>sa.
Since then, Purandarad<193>sa spent the rest of his life, until his ç
final departure from this world (in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1564), in spiritual ç
pursuits, spreading the cult of devotion to God and the message of ç
moral regeneration among the people, both the classes and the masses.
Kanakad<193>sa (<MS>A.D.<D><|>1508-1606), another great saint, was ç
his contemporary.
@SPACE1 = 
The most valuable contribution of Purandarad<193>sa is in the field ç
of classical and devotional music, now well-known as South Indian ç
or Carnatic music. He greatly simplified the methods of teaching, ç
as also learning, which are being followed even today.
Almost all his songs are in Kannada, the lingua franca of the Karnataka ç
State and the rest in Sanskrit. Though he is said to have composed ç
4,25,000 songs, only about a thousand are available now. Even among ç
these, it is difficult to say which ones are his original or real ç
compositions.
Since he toured the country extensively, visiting most of the important ç
places of Hindu pilgrimage, the maximum number of his compositions ç
are devoted to a nice description of these places.
Other topics dealt with in them are: the philosophy of Madhv<193>c<193>rya ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1238-1317) to which school or cult he belonged; the ç
great teachers of this school; various celestial worlds; stories and ç
anecdotes from the pur<193><207>as; descriptions of gods andgoddesses; ç
daily routine of a devotee of  God,  especially  a  br<193>hma<207>a;  and ç
devotional songs on the various aspects ofGod.
He is also reputed to have authored some independent literary works ç
like the Draupad<200>vastr<193>pahara<207>a, Sud<193>macaritra ç
and Paratattvas<193>ra. However, none of these is available now.
