@S10N = Chapter 12 (77 verses)
On various kinds of bath; bath for purification; expiations for mortal ç
sins like murder of a br<193>hma<207>a, consuming liquor, stealing ç
of gold and so on.
This sm<216>ti contains several views considered as peculiar, like ç
eulogising the practice of sat<200> (self-immolation by a widow on ç
the funeral pyre of her husband).
Numerous verses in it also occur in other sm<216>ti-works like those ç
of Manu and Baudh<193>yana.
Later writers of nibandhas quote Par<193>·ara frequently.
M<193>dhav<193>c<193>rya (= Vidy<193>ra<207>ya) (14th cent. <MS>A. ç
D.<D>) has written a voluminous commentary called Par<193>·aram<193>dhav<200>ya ç
on this sm<216>ti.

The g<216>hyas<220>tras are one of the earliest  phases  of  the  dharma·<193>stra ç
literature.
The P<193>raskara G<216>hyas<220>tras is a well-known work, assigned ç
to the <185>ukla Yajurveda tradition and followed mostly in North ç
India.
Nothing is known about the sage P<193>raskara except that he was a ç
disciple of the sage K<193>ty<193>yana who was the author of the <185>rautas<220>tras ç
bearing his name. According to one view, P<193>raskara might have ç
lived during the period 900-800 <MS>B.<|>C<D>. However it is difficult ç
to prove it conclusively.
The work is in three k<193><207><195>as or chapters.

The topics dealt with are, briefly, as follows:
On Vedic sacrifices in general; the sa<221>sk<193>ra or the sacrament ç
of viv<193>ha or marriage; Dar·ap<220>r<207>am<193>sa and Vai·va-deva ç
sacrifices; some more sa<221>sk<193>ras generally included in the ç
group of sixteen (= <218>o<195>a·asa<221>sk<193>ras); on eating flesh; ç
upanayana and the duties of brahmac<193>rin; a special sacrifice called ç
S<200>t<193>yaj<210>a to beperformed in the spring season; the sacrifice ç
called °graya<207><200> to be performed with the newly harvested crop; ç
some miscellaneous subjects like a cure for headaches, controlling ç
one's employees, a few pr<193>ya·cittas or expiations for sins, modes ç
of getting into a chariot and entering an assembly where many people ç
have gathered.
Five commentaries on this G<216>hya-s<220>tras have been discovered: ç
by Gad<193>dhara; by Harihara (Hariharabh<193><218>ya) by Kark<193>c<193>rya; ç
by Jayar<193>ma; and by Vi·van<193>tha. There is one gloss called ç
Am<216>tavy<193>khy<193>, quoted by other writers, but the author ç
is not known.
@NT = para·u
@N1 = (`[that by which] the enemies are dismembered,' `a battle-axe')
The various deities of the Hindu pantheon are shown not only with ç
manyhands but also with several objects including weapons. One such ç
is the para·u (also called kha<207><195>apara·u) or the battle-axe.
It is generally shown in the hands of the male deities like <185>iva ç
and Ga<207>e·a, and occasionally in the hands of the Dev<200> also.
Para·ur<193>ma, considered as one of the ten incarnations of Vi<218><207>u, ç
had this as his main weapon.
@NT = Para·ur<193>ma
@N1 = (`R<193>ma of the battle-axe')
Para·ur<193>ma has been listed as the sixth avat<193>ra or incarnation ç
of Vi<218><207>u among the ten, commonly known as Da·<193>vat<193>ras.
Since R<193>ma (or <185>r<200>r<193>ma) was his contemporary and drew ç
his power into himself, Para·ur<193>ma is often considered as a partial ç
or temporary manifestation of the Lord Vi<218><207>u.
Para·ur<193>ma was the son of the great sage Jamadagni and Re<207>uk<193> ç
(daughter of the king Prasenajit).
Once, he was commanded by his father to cut off the head of his mother ç
which he did. However, by praying to his father, he got her restored ç
to life.
During his absence, K<193>rtav<200>ry<193>rjuna, the king of M<193>hi<218>mat<200>, ç
visited the hermitage of Jamadagni who entertained him in a royal ç
way. This was due to the power and grace of Kapil<193>, the wish-yielding ç
divine cow. When the king wanted it for himself and the sage refused ç
to part with it, he killed the sage and ransacked the whole place.
Learning, after his return, of what had happened, Para·ur<193>ma did ç
severe penance to please Lord <185>iva and obtained a divine Para·u ç
or battle-axe from him. With this he killed, not only K<193>rtav<200>ry<193>r-juna ç
but also many other k<218>attriya kings who had become tyrants and ç
were terrorising their subjects.
However, in his encounter with R<193>ma, he lost all his power and ç
went away for tapas to the Mahendra mountains.
He is said to be a ciraj<200>vin (an immortal) and hence, still living.
He was a great warrior and an expert in the use of various weapons. ç
Dro<207><193>c<193>rya and Kar<207>a were his disciples.
Once, he had to fight with Bh<200><218>ma, the grandsire, but could ç
not vanquish him.
Though he advised Duryodhana to make peace with the P<193><207><195>avas, ç
Duryo-dhana refused to heed it.
Some Vai<218><207>av<193>gamas like the Ahirbudhnya Sa<221>hit<193> ç
and their commentaries like the Tattvatraya consider him as a secondary ç
aspect (svar<220>p<193>ve·a) of Vi<218><207>u.
Iconographical works picture him as a sage, red-complexioned with ç
white robes and ja<219><193>muku<219>a (crown of hair). He holds the ç
para·u in his right hand and the vai<218><207>avadhanus (bow of Vi<218><207>u) ç
in the left. The left hand may also be in the tarjan<200>-mudr<193> ç
or pose of warning or threat.
In some rare cases he may be shown with four hands like Vi<218><207>u.
His jayant<200> (birthday) falls on the Ak<218>ayat<216>t<200>y<193> ç
day (generally in May).
@NT = par<193>vartana
@N1 = (`returning [to the original fold]')
Hinduism has never been an aggressive and proselytising type of religion ç
as some Semitic religions are. Over the centuries, many foreign tribes, ç
including those who came as invaders, have been quietly absorbed into ç
the Hindu fold as and when they adopted Hindu ways of life.
However, conversion from Hinduism to Christianity or Islam has existed ç
for long, as a fact of history, often due to factors other than the ç
voluntary ones. Whenever such converts, an overwhelming majority of ç
whom had been `converted' much against their will, have wished to ç
return to the Hindu fold, there have been several negative factors ç
that have made it difficult for them to return to their mother religion. ç
These negative factors include the lack of a definite or set procedure ç
for reconversion, and, the hesitation or lack of enthusiasm on the ç
part of the Hindu society to absorb these reconverts. In this again, ç
the caste factor seems to be a great hindrance.
It is interesting, however, to note that later sm<216>tis like the ç
Devalasm<216>ti have not only allowed re-entry of such people forcibly ç
converted but also laid some procedures (vide verses 7 to 10 and ç
53 to55).
Nevertheless, over the last two centuries serious attempts have been ç
made to popularise the movement of reconversion, generally called ç
`·uddhi'. Scholars like P. V. K<193><207>e (vide History of Dharma-·<193>stra, ç
Vol. 4, p. 118, Pune, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1953) and institutions like the Dharmanir<207>aya-ma<207><195>ala ç
(Lonavala, Maharashtra State) like to call it `Par<193>vartana' or ç
`returning to [the original religion]'.
Attempts have been made to give this process a formal or ritualistic ç
shape. A brief account of one such is described below:
@SPACE1 = 
A <185>i<218><219>asabh<193> or an assembly of learned persons of ç
pure character should be formed first. The person who wants to return ç
to the Hindu fold should take bath, wear pure white clothes, put a ç
religious mark on the forehead (like sandal paste, vibh<220>ti or ç
holy ash and so on) and approach the assembly with his request to ç
re-enter the Hindu fold. The members of the assembly accede, but prescribe ç
certain simple purificatory rites like fasting. They also give him ç
a new set of clothes (suitable for a religious rite or occasion). ç
He performs the purificatory rites and returns again.
The <193>c<193>rya, the main leader or teacher who conducts the religious ç
rites, will then make him utter a sa<209>kalpa or religious resolve ç
suitable to the occasion. He sits facing the east and makes the new ç
comer to sit on his right side.
This is followed by a regular homa (offering oblations into a duly ç
consecrated fire) with Vedic mantras. At the end, the newcomer too ç
participates directly in the homa by way of purification. He is also ç
given a new name. Then he accepts the gift of a new copy of the sacred ç
book, the Bhagavadg<200>t<193>, and is made to chant certain parts ç
of it (like the 16th chapter, verses 1 to 3). He is advised to try ç
to cultivate the virtues mentioned there.
The participants are given the pras<193>da (consecrated food), after ç
which all will disperse.
(For details of the whole procedure, vide: P. V. Kane, History ç
of Dharma·<193>stra Vol. 4, pp. 828-830, Pune, Bhandarkar Oriental ç
Research Institute, <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1953.)

@NT = P<193>rij<193>ta
@N1 = (`that which was born on the other shore')
The Kalpataru or the wish-yielding tree is said to have been born ç
out of the ocean during samudramathana or the churning of the ocean ç
for obtaining the am<216>ta or ambrosia. (See <MS>SAMUDRAMATHANA<D> ç
for details.)
According to other versions found in the pur<193><207>as, the Kalpataru ç
is not one tree but a general name indicating five such trees, all ç
of them having the same powers of fulfilling the wishes of those that ç
seek them. These trees situated in Indra's garden in heaven are: Haricandana, ç
Kalpa-v<216>k<218>a, Mand<193>ra, P<193>rij<193>ta (or P<193>rij<193>taka) ç
and Sant<193>na.
Once Aditi, the first wife of the great sage Ka·yapa, pleased him ç
by her devoted service. When he asked her to seek a boon she wished ç
to possess quite a few things, to get even one of which, it was so ç
difficult! However, Ka·yapa created the P<193>rij<193>ta tree which ç
had the power to grant anything that its possessor would ask for.
Since Ka·yapa created it in a place on the opposite bank of the river ç
Ga<209>g<193>, it was called `P<193>ri-j<193>ta' (`born on the other ç
shore').
Once, <185>r<200>k<216><218>na, at the request ofqueen Satyabh<193>m<193>, ç
is said to have uprooted it from Indra's garden and planted it in ç
his own royal garden in Dv<193>rak<193>.
@NT = parikarma
@N1 = (`means of refinement')
The Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.C.<D>) is a standard ç
work on Hindu psychology. It deals with the normal mind and suggests ç
the means and methods of raising it to supernormal levels.
Though it deals with the a<218><219><193><209>gas or the eight steps ç
as the primary means of controlling the mind (vide 2.29 to 3.3), ç
it also prescribes seven methods by which the turbulence of the mind ç
can be controlled and, peace and concentration can be attained. These ç
are called `parikarmas'. `Parikarma' means `that which refines or ç
purifies'.
These are: cultivating an attitude offriendship towards happy persons, ç
of compassion towards the afflicted, of joy towards the lucky ones ç
and of indifference towards the sinners; pr<193><207><193>y<193>ma ç
or control of the pr<193><207>ic energy through the control of breath; ç
the experience of supernatural smell, taste etc., through certain ç
meditations; seeing a divine light in one's heart; thinking of the ç
state of mind of a person who is free from all attachments (i.e., ç
a j<200>vanmukta); remembering any divine or holy experience got in ç
a dream; meditation on those objects sanctioned or recommended by ç
the scriptures.
By these methods, the turbulence of the mind can be brought under ç
control.
@NT = Par<200>k<218>it
Par<200>k<218>it was the son of prince Abhimanyu and Uttar<193> (the ç
daughter of the king Vir<193><219>a), and grandson of Arjuna and Subhadr<193>.
After the Mah<193>bh<193>rata war, A·vat-th<193>ma the vengeance-incarnate, ç
discharged the Brahm<193>stra towards the womb of Uttar<193> who was ç
pregnant, to destroy the entire race of the P<193><207><195>avas. ç
Par<200>k<218>it, the baby in the womb died and was stillborn. However, ç
Lord K<216><218><207>a, revived the baby by his divine powers.
It is said that the Lord Vi<218><207>u had given him his vision and ç
the baby-boy started examining every nook and corner through his eyes, ç
to find the Lord. Hence he came to be known as Par<200>k<218>it (= ç
`one who examines or searches').
The P<193><207><195>avas crowned him as the king and left on their ç
final journey (`mah<193>prasth<193>na').
@SPACE1 = 
His queen was Bhadravat<200>†also known as Ir<193>vat<200>†in whom ç
he had four sons: Janamejaya, <185>rutasena, Ugrasena and Bh<200>masena.
After being crowned as the king, he drove away Kalipuru<218>a†the ç
personification of evil of the age of Kali†and ruled the kingdom righteously ç
for sixty years.
Once, as ill-luck would have it, he showed disrespect to <185>am<200>ka, ç
a great sage, who was in deep-meditation, by `garlanding' him with ç
a dead snake. Being cursed by <185><216><209>g<200> (<185>am<200>ka's ç
son) to die of snake bite within a week, he ultimately died of the ç
same, the snake being Tak<218>aka himself (the king of snakes).
It was during his last seven days that he listened to the recitation ç
of the Bh<193>gavata by the sage <185>uka.

@NT = pari<207><193>ma
@N1 = (`change')
According to the S<193><209>khya-Yoga systems of Indian philosophy, ç
any object can undergo two types of `pari<207><193>ma' or change. ç
(This is sometimes called `vik<193>ra' also.) The first concerns the ç
change of form and name, but not of the substance itself. For instance, ç
when gold is converted into ornaments it changes only in form and ç
name. The substance gold continues to remain the same. So is the case ç
with a jar made of clay. The second concerns the change in the substance ç
itself, as for instance, when milk becomes curds.
Sometimes the pari<207><193>mas are classified as three, from another ç
standpoint: dharma-pari<207><193>ma, lak<218>a<207>a-pari<207><193>ma ç
and avasth<193>-pari<207><193>ma.
When an object like clay loses its lump form which is a `dharma' (characteristic) ç
for it and takes the form of a pot, the change is termed as `dharma-pari<207><193>ma' ç
(change of form or characteristic).
The word `lak<218>a<207>a' is a technical term and means change of ç
time. When the same change, i.e., the clay of the past becoming the ç
pot of the present, is looked at from the standpoint of time, it is ç
called `lak<218>a<207>a-pari<207><193>ma' (change in time). The same ç
pot is `new' now, but becomes `old' after sometime. This change of ç
state is called avasth<193>-pari<207><193>ma.
Two more `pari<207><193>mas' are mentioned in the S<193><209>khya ç
works. When pradh<193>na, the matrix of all inanimate objects of this ç
world, is in a state of equilibrium (before creation), each of its ç
three gu<207>as viz., sattva, rajas and tamas, is undergoing only ç
internal change without interfering with the other two gu<207>as. ç
Such a change is called `svar<220>pa-pari<207><193>ma' or `change ç
into the homogeneous'. When the gu<207>as start affecting one another, ç
each getting the upper hand by turns, then, the change is called `vir<220>pa-pari<207><193>ma' ç
or `change into the heterogeneous'.
@NT = pari<207><193>mav<193>da
@N1 = (`the theory of change of state')
According to the Brahmas<220>tras (1.1.2) this world has its origin ç
in Brahman, is sustained by It and is dissolved back into It.
Evolution of this world from Brahman is explained by the different ç
schools of Ved<193>nta in different ways.
Whereas Advaita Ved<193>nta of <185>a<209>kara (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 788-820) ç
considers this world as a `vivarta,' a mere appearance, Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita ç
Ved<193>nta of R<193>m<193>nuja (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1017-1137) accepts ç
`pari<207>a<221>a' or change for Brahman. This change may be a change ç
of form like that of clay being shaped into a pot; or of state, like ç
milk becoming curds.
R<193>m<193>nuja accepts the latter and hence his view is known as ç
`pari<207><193>ma-v<193>da,' or `Brahmapari<207><193>mav<193>da'.
@NT = pari<207><193>minitya
@N1-1 = (`an [entity which] is real, [but] changing')
This is a basic concept of the S<193><209>khya philosophy.
The Upani<218>ads accept the °tman/ Brahman as immutable and as the ç
only reality. The world is said to be a creation from or out of ç
It. S<193><209>khya philosophy considers this as self-contradictory, ç
sincewhat is real and immutable cannot undergo any change.
Hence it accepts two basic realities† the puru<218>a or the conscious ç
self, and, the prak<216>ti or the insentient matrix of all matters.
The latter, though real, is not immutable. It changes or evolves ç
into this world. Hence it is called `pari<207><193>minitya'.
@NT = p<193>riplava
@N1 = (`that which is repeated again and again')
In ancient India, especially for the kings and the emperors, performance ç
of the Vedic sacrifices was rather the rule than an exception.
Powerful kings and emperors thought of performing the A·vamedha sacrifice ç
as a matters of prestige, to establish their supremacy over other ç
rulers.
As a part of this sacrifice, a duly selected horse was let off to ç
roam about as it liked, for a period of one year, after which it would ç
be brought back.
Kings or rulers of the lands where the horse roamed about, were either ç
to accept the sovereignty of the performer of the sacrifice and pay ç
some ransom, or, fight with the army accompanying the horse.
During this one year period, the king who is in yaj<210>ad<200>k<218><193> ç
(taking vows as per the rules of the sacrifice) has to perform an ç
i<218><219>i (a simple sacrifice) to Savit<216> (the Sun) three times ç
a day. After the last offering in the evening he has to sit and listen ç
to some ancient legends recited by the hot<216> priest (See <MS>HOT<184><D>.) ç
in the presence of other priests. These recitations go by the general ç
name `p<193>riplava'.
A p<193>riplava lasts for ten days. It is repeated 36 times in one ç
year. What exactly should be the legends to be recited on each day ç
is prescribed in the <185>rauta-s<220>tra works. The itih<193>sas ç
and the pur<193><207>as are to be recited on the 8th and the 9th nights.
The whole idea seems to be that the mind of the yajam<193>na (sacrificer) ç
should be kept on a high plane as much as possible.
@NT = pari<218>ad
@N1 = (`a gathering of people sitting around')
Though the Vedas and allied literature give general rules and guidance ç
about dharma, they do not offer solutions to all the problems that ç
arise in the life of an individual or society. Hence, the ancient ç
sages advised a person in doubt about a particular mode of conduct, ç
to consult or observe  the  wise  br<193>hma<207>as  (vide Taittir<200>ya ç
Upani<218>ad 1.11).
In course of time `pari<218>ads' of learned men†known earlier as `sabh<193>s' ç
or `samitis' †were recommended for deciding such issues concerning ç
dharma and even pres-cribing expiations for transgressions.
A pari<218>ad should consist of at least ten ·i<218><219>as (good ç
and great men of character) though it could be less, if such men are ç
not available in the required number. However, a pari<218>ad of only ç
one person† though  permitted  theoretically  under extraordinary  circumstances†was  not ç
encouraged.
The members of the pari<218>ads were to be experts in the Vedic lore ç
as also the dharma·<193>stras and vyavah<193>ra (social conduct). ç
They were to be persons of exceptional character and merit. They must ç
be competent to decide the subtlest points of dharma and offer the ç
necessary solutions and guidance when the problems were brought before ç
them. They should also be capable of prescribing the necessary expiations ç
for sins depending on their gravity.
Generally, the king of the land as also a monk of exceptional merit ç
were part of the pari<218>ad. Though the king might not sit with the ç
members of the pari<218>ad, his consent to the decisions taken was ç
compulsory. However, even the king could not take any decision in ç
such matters without consulting the pari<218>ad.
@NT = parisa<209>khy<193>vidhi
@N1-1 = (`exclusive injunction')
The P<220>rvam<200>m<193><221>s<193> system describes three kinds ç
of vidhis or Vedic injunctions. They are: ap<220>rvavidhi, niyamavidhi ç
and parisa<209>khy<193>vidhi. (See <MS>AP<188>RVAVIDHI<D> and <MS>NIYAMAVIDHI<D>.)
These vidhis or injunctions are helpful in ascertaining the correct ç
meaning of the Vedic sentences, especially with regard to the performance ç
of sacrifices.
When a general rule seems to apply equally to two alternatives and ç
only one has to be allowed, precluding the other, the vidhi or injunction ç
that prescribes it is called `parisa<209>khy<193>vidhi'.
`Pari' means varjana or excluding. `Sa<209>khy<193>' means knowledge. ç
Hence the parisa<209>khy<193>vidhi gives us the knowledge of what ç
is to be avoided in a particular situation.
For instance: A cart, to which a horse and a mule are yoked, is taken ç
out to bring the clay necessary for preparing bricks (for the altar ç
of a sacrifice). At a certain stage of the journey, the person driving ç
the cart has to `recite a Vedic mantra holding the rein.' Since both ç
the animals have reins, the doubt arises as to which one should be ç
held. The Vedic mantra states clearly that the rein of the horse is ç
to be held. Hence, the other†the rein of the mule†is to be excluded. ç
Therefore this injunction becomes a `pari-sa<209>khy<193>vidhi'.
Writers on the M<200>m<193><221>s<193> point out three defects in ç
this vidhi, but they are not of much consequence.

the Kalpas<220>tras, the last of the Ved<193><209>gas, deal with Vedic ç
sacrifices also, they often do not give all the details necessary. ç
Perhaps, during the period of their composition, quite a few things ç
had been taken for granted. However, when in course of time, these ç
details were being forgotten, it became necessary to put them in writing ç
for the guidance of the future generations. This gave rise to pari·i<218><219>as, ç

In every Hindu temple, in addition to the main deity in the sanctum ç
sanctorum (garbhag<216>ha), there are other deities surrounding it. ç
They are generally called pariv<193>radevat<193>s and smaller shrines ç
are also built to house them, according to the directions given in ç
the iconographical and architectural works.
These pariv<193>radevat<193>s may be members of the immediate legendary ç
family of the main deity, or other deities associated with it like ç
personal attendants or guar-dians of quarters or commanders of troops ç
and so on.
For instance, in a <185>iva temple, the following are the pariv<193>radevat<193>s: ç
Nandi (or V<216><218>abha, the Bull), Brahm<193> or Durg<193>, Saptam<193>t<216>k<193>s ç
(Seven Mothers like C<193>mu<207><195><193>), Ga<207>e·a, <186>a<207>mukha ç
(Subrah-ma<207>ya), Jye<218><219>h<193> (or Alak<218>m<200>), Vi<218><207>u ç
and S<220>rya.
They are situated respectively in the east, south-east, south, south-west, ç
west, north-west, north and north-east.
The direction in which each of these shrines should face, is also ç
specified.
The P<193><209>car<193>tra texts give a different list of pariv<193>radevatas ç
surrounding the chief deity in a Vi<218><207>u temple, such as Kapila, ç
Ka·yapa, Rudra, Agni, Bh<216>gu, Sarasvat<200>, N<193>rada, S<220>rya ç
and others.
These deities are situated in the inner round. Other deities may be ç
installed in two outer rounds. Though there is thus a provision for ç
three rounds the last one is rarely executed.

(15.18) and the °pastamba Dharmas<220>tras (2.5.12.22) declare that ç
a younger brother should not marry before the elder brother. In case ç
he did, he was called `parivett<193>' and the act itself was known ç
as `parivedana'. However, if the elder brother was a lunatic, a patient ç
suffering from an incu-rable serious disease, an impotent person or ç
had become a monk, the younger one was permitted to marry.
This restriction applied to a younger sister also who married before ç
her elder sister. All persons involved in such an act like the parents ç
of the couple and the priest as also the two brothers were considered ç
as sinners who would go to hell! Pr<193>ya·cittas or expiations were ç

It is rather difficult to understand the logic behind this prohibition.

@NT = P<193>r·van<193>tha
@N1 = (circa 800 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>)
Jainism is one of the oldest religions of the world. It recognises ç
a succession of twenty-four teachers, called `T<200>rtha<209>karas,' ç
starting with V<216><218>abhadeva (or <184><218>abha-deva) who has ç
been mentioned in the Bh<193>gavata (5.2 to 6) and other pur<193><207>as. ç
The last two†considered as historical personalities by the modern ç
historians† are P<193>r·van<193>tha and Vardham<193>na Mah<193>v<200>ra.
P<193>r·van<193>tha was the son of A·vasena (the king of K<193>·<200>) ç
and V<193>m<193> or M<193>y<193>dev<200>.
Refusing to tread the path of worldly life, he started, even as a ç
youth, to travel like a monk all over the country. He taught against ç
hi<221>s<193> or violence of all kinds including those in the Vedic ç
sacrifices.
According to another version, he grew into a great warrior, fought ç
his way up to Kali<209>ga (the modern Orissa), married a princess, ç
the daughter of Prasenajit (the king of Kosala) and lived the life ç
of a householder till the 30th year. Later, the sight of the very ç
picture of Nemin<193>tha (the 22nd T<200>rtha<209>kara) inspired him ç
to renounce the world and roam about as a (Jain) monk.
He taught the principles of Jainism from his 30th to the 100th year ç
making a very large number of disciples, among whom were kings and ç
noblemen too.
The parents of Vardham<193>na Mah<193>-v<200>ra were also followers ç
of his religion.
Since he is said to have passed away about 250 years before Mah<193>v<200>ra, ç
he must have lived during the 9th and the 8th centuries <MS>B.<|>C.<D> ç
Some scholars opine that he must have lived from 817 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> ç
to 717 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> or from 838 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> to 738 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> ç
He passed away in the P<193>rasn<193>th Hill, now in North Bihar.
P<193>r·van<193>tha taught his followers not to 1) injure life; 2) ç
tell lies; 3) possess any property.
Bhavadevas<220>ri's P<193>r·van<193>thacarita (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1356) ç
is the most authoritative work on his life.
In Jain sculpture he is shown with a snake canopy, the snake having ç
3 or 7 or 9 or 11 hoods. The association with a serpent is rooted ç
in a legend according to which P<193>r·van<193>tha is said to have ç

This is one of the minor rites that is classed among the p<193>kayaj<210>as. ç
(See <MS>VEDIC SACRIFICES.<D>)
Its name is derived from the fact that it has to be performed on a ç
`parvan' day (a day specified by the holy books assacred) and food ç
cooked in a vessel (p<193>ka = cooking; sth<193>l<200> = vessel) has ç
to be offered into the fire.
A newly married person has to perform this rite after returning home, ç
after marriage. It has to be begun on the first full-moon day. The ç
wife has to husk the rice grains and cook it, to prepare it for offering. ç
The husband offers this cooked food into the fire, first to the deities ç
of the Vedic Dar·ap<220>r<207>am<193>sa sacrifice and then to Agni-Svi<218><219>ak<216>t. ç
The remnants are given to a br<193>hma<207>a as food.
Once begun, it has to be performed regularly on the new-moon and the ç
full- moon days throughout life.
The couple has to fast either completely or partially on those days.

@NT = P<193>rvat<200>
@N1 = (`daughter of the mountain-king')
P<193>rvat<200> is the power and consort of<185>iva, the god of disintegration ç
and destruction. An overwhelming majority of the goddesses of Hinduism ç
are aspects and variations of P<193>rvat<200>. The names by which ç
she is known or worshipped are too numerous to mention. If some of ç
the names like P<193>rvat<200>, Haimavat<200>, Girij<193> and D<193>k<218><193>ya<207><200> ç
indicate her origin from the Him<193>layas or Dak<218>a (one of the ç
forefathers of mankind), other names like <185>iv<193>, M<216><195><193>n<200>, ç
Rudr<193><207><200> and <185>arv<193><207>i stress her aspect as the ç
spouse of <185>iva. Still others like Apar<207><193> and Um<193> have ç
specific reference to certain stories in the paur<193><207>ic literature.
One of the earliest references to this deity is found in the Kenopani<218>ad ç
(3.12) where she is mentioned as `Um<193> Haima-vat<200>' enlightening ç
Indra, the king of gods, about Brahman, the Absolute or God. This ç
reference is enough to conclude that the worship of this goddess is ç
very ancient.
@SPACE1 = 
According to the paur<193><207>ic accounts, in her `first' incarnation, ç
she was D<193>k<218><193>-ya<207><200>, the daughter of Dak<218>a ç
and Pras<220>ti, and married to Lord <185>iva. Unable to understand ç
Lord <185>iva's greatness, Dak<218>a once reviled him and started ç
harbouring hatred towards him. When Dak<218>a undertook the performance ç
of a great sacrifice, the notable exception among the dignitaries ç
invited was <185>iva himself. Much against the advice of her spouse, ç
D<193>k<218><193>ya<207><200> went to the sacrifice uninvited and ç
being slighted, ended her life by igniting herself through the fire ç
of yoga. Hence she came to be known as Sat<200>, the chaste one. She ç
was next reborn as P<193>rvat<200>, the daughter of Himav<193>n and ç
Men<193>. After performing intense austerities she succeeded in pleasing ç
<185>iva and making him accept her again as his consort.
During the performance of these severe austerities, she refused to ç
eat even dry leaves to sustain herself and hence got the appellation ç
Apar<207><193>. Her mother Men<193> unable to see her dear daughter ç
languishing by austerities, tried to dissuade her by the words, `U ç
m<193>' (= mydear, don't do like this!) which became her another ç
name (Um<193>). Being the daughter of the Him<193>layas (the abode ç
of snow) she has to be Gaur<200> (the white one). As the mother of ç
the universe she is Amb<193> and Ambik<193>, both the words meaning ç
`mother'.
Like her consort <185>iva, she also has two aspects: the mild and ç
the terrible. As P<193>rvat<200> or Um<193> she represents the mild ç
aspect. In this aspect she is usually shown with <185>iva. Then she ç
has only two hands, the right hand holding a blue lotus and the left ç
hanging loosely by the side. The image is richly decorated. When represented ç
independently she is shown with four hands, two hands holding red ç
and blue lotuses and the other two exhibiting the varada and abhaya ç
mudr<193>s.
Though all the female deities are called <185>aktis of their male ç
counterparts, the words `<185>akti' and `Dev<200>' are more particularly†or ç
even exclusively†used to denote the <185>akti of <185>iva, the innumerable ç
aspects of P<193>rvat<200>. Considering <185>iva as Mah<193>deva, ç
the Supreme God, P<193>rvat<200> represents his power by which the ç
universe is created, sustained and destroyed.
The Him<193>layas represent the °k<193>·a or ether, the first fundamental ç
substance. Men<193> stands for intelligence. Hence P<193>rvat<200>, ç
their offspring, represents the conscious substance of the universe. ç
That is why she is also called Um<193> (= light, the bright one).
At the subjective level, Um<193>-Haima-vat<200> represents Brahmavidy<193> ç
or spiritual wisdom, by which union with <185>iva or God is attained.
Being the consort of <185>iva, who is Rudra, the terrible, she also ç
has her terrible aspects which need a separate study.
It is interesting to note that the Vai<218><207>ava symbols†<185>a<209>kha ç
and Cakra† are often shown in her hands also. Though the pur<193><207>as ç
describe her as the sister of Vi<218><207>u, it is possible that Vi<218><207>u ç
is consi-dered as the active power of <185>iva and hence these symbols ç
in the hands of the Dev<200>. This surmise is strengthened by the ç
fact that in the Haryardham<220>rti of <185>iva, the left half is ç
Vi<218><207>u and in the Ardha-n<193>r<200>·vara form, Dev<200> forms ç
the left half.

°jya or ghee is an important material used in Vedic sacrifices. After ç
it is kept in the vessel known as <193>jyasth<193>l<200>, it has to ç
be ceremonially purified before being offered into the consecrated ç
fire. This is done by moving an ulmuka or a firebrand three times ç
round the <193>jya contained in that vessel, placed over the fire. ç
This particular act is called `paryagnikara<207>a'. The whole procedure ç
is known as `<193>jyasa<221>sk<193>ra'. The <193>jya is said to acquire ç
a  special  lustre  by  this  purificatory process.
The fire for the firebrand is drawn from the <193>havan<200>ya fire.
The other objects for paryagnikara<207>a are: y<220>pa (sacrificial ç

them both. Generally the a<209>ku·a is held in the right hand and ç
the p<193>·a in the left.
These two signify the controlling and the binding power of the deity.
Iconographical works show them in a variety of ways.

@NT = p<193><218>a<207><195>in

`P<193>' means `to protect'. `<186>a<207><195>' means `to revile'. ç
Hence the word literally means `one who reviles'. In practice, it ç
was used to indicate all persons who reviled the Vedas (or did not ç
believe in them) which alone can protect the human beings (according ç
to the believers) by spiritually elevating them.
Several sects such as K<193>p<193>la, N<193>kula (P<193>·upata), V<193>ma, ç
Bhairava, K<193>l<193>mukha (and even the P<193><210>car<193>tra!) ç

The lists often included the Jains and the Buddhists also.

shield in the two upper hands, the lower two hands showing the mudras ç
(or poses) of abhaya (protection) and varada (giving boons).

@NT = Pa·upatin<193>tha Temple
One of the most important places of pilgrimage associated with Lord ç
<185>iva is the Pa·upatin<193>tha Temple in Nepal.
Nepal, got its name by its association with a great sage called `Nemi ç
Muni' (Sk<193>ndapur<193><207>a, Himavatkha<207><195>a, 11.60). ç
He is said to have lived near this temple and taken care of it.
Nepal is full of Hindu temples, of which the temple of Pa·upatin<193>tha ç
is the most important and the holiest. According to the local traditions ç
it is at least 1500 years old.
The legend goes that Lord <185>iva and his divine spouse P<193>rvat<200>, ç
while wandering in the Him<193>layas came here, liked the place very ç
much and settled down as a `m<216>ga and m<216>g<200>' (deer-couple). ç
When the gods of heaven started searching for the `missing' couple, ç
they found a strange deer with one horn and three eyes, moving about, ç
along with a female deer. Recognising them as <185>iva and P<193>rvat<200>, ç
the gods tried to take them back to Kail<193>sa (the abode of <185>iva) ç
but failed. <185>iva gave up the deer form, assumed the jyotirli<209>ga ç
shape (li<209>ga of light) and settled down on the bank of river B<193>gmat<200> ç
(now in K<193><219>hma<207><195>u, the capital of Nepal).
Since he had assumed the shape of a pa·u or animal, but is really ç
the pati or Lord of all livings beings, he is known as `Pa·upati' ç
or `Pa·upatin<193>tha'.
The Nep<193>lam<193>h<193>tmya (15.3-5) of the work mentioned earlier, ç
declares that this temple of Pa·upatin<193>tha is surrounded bythe ç
rivers Kau·ik<200>, Tri·<220>laga<209>g<193> and another `holy river ç
with cold waters'. `<185>ivapur<200>' (Kail<193>sa mountain?) is towards ç
the north.
The temple was destroyed by the Muslim invaders in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1350 ç
but was rebuilt by the king Jayasi<221>har<193>ma. The present structure ç
was built in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1692 in two stories since the old one was ç
destroyed by white ants!
The li<209>ga in the main shrine is made of black stone and has four ç
faces. Each has a pair of hands in different mudras (poses). The scalps ç
have matted hair on the three faces and the fourth face†half man and ç
half woman†is that of Ardha-n<193>r<200>·vara.

Belief in a Supernatural Being or Power†generally called `God'†is ç
ingrained in the human psyche. The words of a scripture and/or of ç
the men of God, are considered as sacrosanct and hence, inviolable. ç
Not following them or going against them has always been regarded ç
as a sin resulting in grave consequences.
