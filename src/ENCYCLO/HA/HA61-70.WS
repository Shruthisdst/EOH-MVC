is also one. When the couple go round the nuptial fire three times†this ç

the purport of which is that she should be firm and steady like the ç
stone, in her marital life which is spiritual companionship.

The Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali (200<|><F51320MS>B.C.<W1>) defines ç
yoga as the suppression of the citta-v<216>ttis or the modifications ç

(`the afflicted'). These `kle·as' or afflictions are again listed ç

been defined as the false identification of the seer or the Self, ç
called d<216>k·akti or puru<218>a, with the instrument of seeing viz., ç
the buddhi (intellect or mind) (2.6). When the puru<218>a who is really ç

The third emperor of the Mauryan dynasty and one of the greatest that ç

His empire extended from  G<193>ndh<193>ra (Afghanistan)  up  to ç
southern Karnataka. The terrible bloodshed witnessed during his conquest ç
of the Kali<209>ga Kingdom (Orissa) brought about a big change in ç
his mental attitude. He thence-forward vowed to conquer by dharma ç
rather than by war and violence. He is believed to have embraced Buddhism ç
and dispatched Buddhist missionaries to several countries of the world. ç
His rule was a golden era in Indian history. The several rock-edicts ç
erected by him all over the country bespeak of his rule of dharma.
A·oka is also the name of a tree (Saraca indica) believed to be ç
dear to <185>iva, and hence, considered sacred. The grove of A·oka ç
trees is mentioned in the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a as the place where ç
S<200>t<193> was confined by the demon king R<193>va<207>a. Hence ç
Hindu women over the ages have associated it with constancy and chastity, ç
have worshipped it, as also eaten its tender buds.
@NT = A·ok<193><218><219>am<200>
Observance of festivals and sacred days is a common phenomenon in ç
all societies that believe in and practise religion. In Hinduism, ç
due to the variety and multiplicity of cults, the number of such days ç
is legion.
A·ok<193><218><219>am<200> is one of the less known or minor festivals. ç
It is celebrated on the eighth day (a<218><219>am<200>) of the bright ç
fortnight in the month of Caitra (March-April) and the flowers of ç
the A·oka tree (Saraca indica) have been specially recommended for ç
worship, Goddess Durg<193> being the deity of worship. Hence the name ç
A·ok<193><218><219>am<200>. The day is considered doubly sacred if ç
it happens to be a Wednesday with the Punarvasu  nak<218>atra  (seventh  lunar ç
mansion consisting of two stars). On this day, housewives believe ç
that, by eating the tiny buds of the A·oka tree they will be free ç
from ·oka or sorrow (a-·oka = free from sorrow). A bath in the Brahmaputra ç
river on this day is considered as very sacred, yielding the same ç
fruit as the performance of the V<193>japeya sacrifice.

Govindap<193>da (8th cent. <F51320MS>A.D.<W1>) who was himself the teacher ç
of <185>a<209>kara. This commentary is well-known as <F255MI>M<193><207><195><220>kya ç
K<193>rik<193>. <185>a<209>kara has written a gloss over this also.
The M<193><207><195><220>kya K<193>rik<193> which advocates an extreme ç
form of Advaita Ved<193>nta, has used the term `aspar·a-yoga' twice ç
(3.39; 4.2). The word `spar·a' is generally used to signify contact ç
of the sense-organs with the sense-objects. Hence any yoga or superconscious ç
experience in which, naturally, there is no contact of the senses ç
with the sense-objects may be called as aspar·a-yoga. But in this ç
work, this epithet has been especially used to denote the direct experience ç
of the °tman or the Self which is beyond the ken of all sense-organs ç
and sense-experience. In this experience the lower self and the consequent ç
ego-sense are completely dissolved leaving unalloyed bliss only. This ç
is the same as `j<210><193>na.' The prospect of dissolution of the ç
ego-sense often frightens the ordinary yogis and spiritual aspirants ç
who therefore try to avoid it (3.39). However, those who dare try ç
it obtain the greatest happiness, the highest good and absolute freedom ç
from all doubts and misgivings (4.2).

@NT = asp<216>·yat<193>
@N1 = (`untouchability')
Asp<216>·yat<193> or untouchability, as it has been practised during ç
the last few centuries, is definitely a blot on the Hindu society. ç
Even after its abolition by the Indian constitution (vide art. 17) ç
it conti-nues to linger on, especially in the rural areas, due to ç
age-old prejudices and lack of enlightenment brought about by the ç
absence of proper education.
Neither in the Vedas nor in the earlier dharma·<193>stras do we find ç
any sanction for this abominable practice. Though carmamnas (tanners ç
of hides), ca<207><195><193>las and paulkasas, vaptas (barbers) and ç
others who have been included in the lists of asp<216>·yas by the ç
later works, have been mentioned, they had been considered as ·<220>dras ç
only.
While describing the need to maintain physical cleanliness and ceremonial ç
purity on certain occasions, a kind of asp<216>·yat<193> has been ç
advocated in our secondary scriptures. For instance: The following ç
persons were declared as asp<216>·yas and coming into contact with ç
them would oblige one to take a bath:† those in s<220>taka and a·auca ç
(observing ceremonial impurity brought about by birth or death of ç
close relatives in a family), a woman in her monthly courses, those ç
who have not washed their hands after food, those engaged in trades ç
which soil the body and the clothes like butchery or removing night-soil, ç
sinners and criminals.
It is interesting to note that the very same scriptures have shown ç
immense wisdom in ordaining that even such untouchability need not ç
be observed in holy places and on holy occasions like a rathotsava ç
(temple-car festival) or during national  emergencies.  Some  of  the ç
dharma·<193>stras like the Sm<216>tyarthas<193>ra of <185>r<200>dhara ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1200) permit the asp<216>·yas to enter temples. They ç
were permitted to worship the images of the avat<193>ras or incarnations ç
of Vi<218><207>u and were expected to follow the moral code. They ç
were also free to practise devotion to God through n<193>majapa (repetition ç
of the divine name) and singing devotional songs. Quite a fewgreat ç
saints of Hinduism belonged to the caste of the untouchables and were ç
honoured by the entire society.
It is rather, difficult to say when exactly untouchability became ç
a rigid and fossilised system. What began as a segregation of persons ç
engaged in unclean vocations due to reasons of health and sanitation, ç
might have been perpetuated by vested economic interests, by gradually ç
denying them educational, economic and cultural upliftment. It was ç
purely a social phenomenon and had nothing to do with Hindu religion.
@SPACE1 = 
The list of names of various castes and subcastes included under the ç
asp<216>·ya groups seems to have grown quite long in course of time. ç
In practice, it was taken to such ridiculous proportions that even ç
if the shadow of an untouchable fell on a person of the higher castes, ç
it was polluting!
In modern times, eradication of the system of untouchability engaged ç
the minds of great leaders like Mah<193>tm<193> G<193>ndh<200> and ç
N<193>r<193>ya<207>a Guru. The diffusion of good education and culture, ç
impressing upon everyone of the equality of all persons before the ç
law and God, can help in this onerous task. If the more educated persons ç
in these castes take greater interest in uplifting their less fortunate ç
brothers and sisters, the pace of reformation of the society would ç
be quicker.

@NT = <193>·rama
@N1 = (`place of resting')
According to the value-system propounded by Hinduism, mok<218>a or ç
spiritual emancipation is the ultimate goal of life. However, emotional ç
infirmities like attachment and aversion or lust, greed and anger ç
always raise their ugly heads to thwart man's spiritual progress. ç
With an uncanny insight into human psychology the ancient sages of ç
India have prescribed a way of life which affords scope and opportunity ç
for the fulfilment of all the legitimate desires, while keeping them ç
under a healthy check. The concept of the four puru<218><193>rthas ç
(See <MS>PURU<186>°RTHAS.<D>), when looked at from this angle, is ç
a unique contribution. The philosophy behind this concept aims at ç
the gradual sublimation of the human instincts by first allowing them ç
to find a healthy expression. The method of achieving this is the ç
<193>·rama-system.
According to this system, the life of the individual is divided into ç
four <193>·ramas or stages of life: brahmacarya (student-hood), g<193>rhasthya ç
(married state), v<193>na-prastha (the state of the forest recluse) ç
and sa<221>ny<193>sa (monkhood).
Brahmacarya was the first stage of life. It was the period (usually ç
of twelve years' duration from the seventh or eighth to the nineteenth ç
or twentieth year) devoted to study and discipline. The student was ç
required to stay in the house of his teacher and learn the sciences ç
and arts.
The preceptors in ancient India usually lived in hermitages not far ç
from towns. The children under their care lived under the same roof ç
without any distinction of wealth and status, all leading a hard, ç
austere life. Serving the teacher and participating in the household ç
duties were as much part of their life as learning the Vedas and secular ç
sciences. Begging the food, eschewing the pleasures of life (in which ç
brahmacarya or continence was the most important), abstaining from ç
the affairs of the world were important aspects of their training.
@SPACE1 = 
After returning home, the student, now a young man, was usually expected ç
to marry and raise a family. Since marriage was considered a sacrament ç
and the wife as a life-mate in righteous living, it was not considered ç
as an obstacle to self-evolution. The g<216>hastha or the householder ç
was expected to earn well by righteous means and live a happy and ç
decent life, which had to be socially useful. Among his principal ç
duties were the five daily sacrifices, known as pa<210>cayaj<210>as: ç
sacrifice to gods like Indra, study and teaching of the Vedas, obsequial ç
offerings to the departed manes, feeding guests and domestic animals.
At the approach of old age, the householder was to hand over the responsi-bilities ç
of the family to his children and retire to the forest along with ç
his wife, if she was willing. In this stage known as `v<193>naprastha' ç
(vana = forest, prasth<193>na = going) he was to lead a contemplative ç
life, in spiritual pursuits. It was actually a life preparatory to ç
the final stage, sa<221>ny<193>sa.
When the forest recluse felt enough inner strength to totally renounce ç
all possessions and lead the life of an itinerant monk, he would embrace ç
sa<221>ny<193>sa or the monastic life after sending his wife to be ç
taken care of by the children. In this stage he had to move about ç
constantly, begging his food and spending his entire time in contemplation ç
on the Self or God. He wasto practise self-control, freedom from ç
desires, ambitions and attachments, and, universal love.
Though these four <193>·ramas were intended to be adopted successively, ç
excep- tions were allowed in special cases, so that persons could ç
take to sa<221>ny<193>sa even from the first or the second stage.
Again, it was the dvijas or the `twice-born' classes (br<193>hma<207>as, ç
k<218>attriyas and vai·yas) that were considered eligible for this ç
fourfold <193>·rama system. Some scriptures allowed sa<221>ny<193>sa ç
only to the br<193>hma<207>as.
@SPACE1 = 
The word `<193>·rama,' in a non-technical sense means a place of resting, ç
a hermi-tage of sages. Such <193>·ramas were generally built in places ç
of natural beauty and quietness, like a forest, banks of rivers, foot ç
or top of a hill and so on. They were earmarked for `simple living ç
and high thinking,' for austerities, contemplation and spiritual studies.

@NT = °·rama Upani<218>ad
As the very name suggests, this minor Upani<218>ad belonging to the ç
Atharvaveda, deals with the <193>·ramas or stages of life. The treatment ç
however is very brief.
There are four recognized <193>·ramas: brahmacarya, g<193>rhasthya, ç
v<193>naprastha and sa<221>ny<193>sa. Those following the waysof ç
life of these four <193>·ramas are respectively called brahmac<193>rins ç
(Vedic students), g<216>hasthas (householders), v<193>naprasthins ç
(forest recluses) and sa<221>ny<193>sins (mendicants or monks).
The brahmac<193>rins are of four types: g<193>yatra, br<193>hma<207>a, ç
pr<193>j<193>patya and b<216>han.
The `g<193>yatra' is the novice who has had his upanayana ceremony ç
and has been taught the G<193>yatr<200>mantra. He is expected to subsist ç
for three days after the upa- nayana, on food bereft of jaggery and ç
salt. A `br<193>hma<207>a' is one who lives in his preceptor's house ç
for 48 years to learn all the four Vedas, the study of each Veda needing ç
about twelve years. A `pr<193>j<193>patya' is one who is faithful ç
to his wife. Alter- natively, those who spend 24 years and 48 years ç
with their preceptors to learn the Vedas are called `br<193>hma<207>as' ç
and `pr<193>j<193>patyas' respectively. The `b<216>han' is one who ç
lives with his preceptor throughout his life. He is also called `nai<218><219>hika.'
The g<216>hasthas are also of four kinds: v<193>rt<193>kav<216>tti, ç
·<193>l<200>nav<216>tti, y<193>y<193>vara and ghora-sa<221>ny<193>sika.
Among these, the first group lives byagriculture, dairy-farming, ç
trade and commerce, the vocations considered blameless. They live ç
their full span of life, working and praying to the Supreme Self. ç
The second group of g<216>hasthas perform the Vedic rituals, study ç
the Vedas and give gifts to others. However, they do not undertake ç
to perform Vedic sacrifices for others, nor teach the Vedas to others, ç
nor accept gifts. The third group of g<216>hasthas do both: performing ç
sacrifices for themselves and for others; studying and teaching the ç
Vedas; giving and accepting gifts. Both the second and the third groups ç
continue to maintain the Vedic fires and pray to the Supreme Self. ç
The last group, the most austere, is particular in using water brought ç
from wells and purified by straining as also live upon grain pickedup ç
from the fields (This is called `u<210>chav<216>tti'.) daily. These ç
g<216>hasthas too perform the prescribed Vedic rites throughout life ç
and pray to the Supreme Self.
The v<193>naprasthins too are of four varieties: vaikh<193>nasa, udumbara, ç
b<193>la-khilya (or v<193>lakhilya), and phenapa.
@SPACE1 = 
The vaikh<193>nasas maintain the sacred fires with the help of dried ç
wood grown wildly, perform the five daily sacrifices and pray to the ç
Supreme Self. The udumbaras too do the same thing except that they ç
maintain the sacred fires by the wood of the fig or jujube trees found ç
in the direction in which they wake up in the morning. The b<193>lakhilyas ç
wear long hair and coarse dress made of cotton, skin or bark, give ç
up flowers and fruits on certain specified days, follow the earlier ç
professions for maintenance, perform the five daily sacrifices and ç
pray to the Supreme Self. The last group, phenapas, behave like insane ç
persons, live by eating cast off leaves and fruits, maintain the Vedic ç
fires wherever they are, perform the five daily sacrifices and pray ç
to the Supreme Self.
The sa<221>ny<193>sins also are of four categories: ku<219><200>cara, ç
bah<220>daka, ha<221>sa and paramaha<221>sa.
The first beg their food from the houses of their own sons. The second ç
wear all the insignias of the sa<221>ny<193>sins like wooden sandals, ç
loin cloth, ochre robes and so on, and beg their food from the house ç
of br<193>hma<207>as of good conduct. They keep the tuft of hair and ç
the sacred thread also. The third, keep these insignias but give up ç
the tuft of hair. They carry a staff and a waterpot. They roam about ç
not halting in any place for more than one to three days and perform ç
severe austerities. The last, the paramaha<221>sas, are the highest ç
in this series. They do not carry any of the usual insignias of the ç
sa<221>ny<193>sins, live in deserted and lonely places like abandoned ç
buildings or temples, have transcended all social rules, customs and ç
manners, accept alms fromall without distinction and practise supreme ç
equanimity. All these four cate-gories too pray to the Supreme Self.

the word in the sentences.
For centuries, this work has been accepted as the most basic and standard ç

@EMERGENCY = The <184>gveda, the first and the foremost of the four ç
Vedas, consists of 10,552 mantras or verses. There are two well-known ç
systems of dividing these mantras into books, sections or chapters. ç
As per the first system which groups the mantras according to the ç
deities, topics and metres, the <184>gveda is divided into ten `ma<207><195>alas,' ç
each ma<207><195>ala being subdivided again into `anuv<193>ka' and ç
`s<220>kta.' Though this methodis good from the standpoint of study, ç
it is not good from the standpoint of memorization (which had a supreme ç
place in ancient Vedic studies) since there is a large variation in ç
the number of mantras in each ma<207><195>ala. Hence an attempt was ç
made later to divide the whole of the <184>gveda into eight sections, ç
each called an `a<218><219>aka,' keeping the total number of mantras ç
in each a<218><219>aka almost the same. Each a<218><219>aka was again ç
sub- divided into eight `adhy<193>yas' or chapters and the adhy<193>yas ç
into `vargas' or groups. The vargas consisted of the mantras. Due ç
care has been taken to maintain the total number of ak<218>aras or ç
letters in each a<218><219>aka the same, since some mantras are in ç
longer metres.
@EMERGENCY = The following table gives an idea of this division:

Performance of religious rites in honour of the dead ancestors exists ç
in all the societies of the world, in some form or the other. The ç
`a<218><219>ak<193>' (also known as `a<218><219>aka-·r<193>ddha') ç
is a Vedic rite enjoined to be performed in honour of the pit<216>s ç
or ancestors (a<218><219>aka = pit<216>, ancestor). The name is also ç
derived from the fact that it has to be done on the eighth day (a<218><219>ak<193>= ç
of the eighth day) of the dark fortnights of the four months†M<193>rga·<200>r<218>a, ç
Pau<218>a, M<193>gha and Ph<193>lguna (November to February). Though ç
it is meant for the pit<216>s or ancestors, deities like Vi·vedevas, ç
Agni and S<220>rya are also mentioned as the recipients of the offerings. ç
The total number of such rites is generally three. Cooked vegetables, ç
cakes and even flesh are the offerings.
Sometimes the rites are compressed <%-2>into one rite spread over ç
three days or<|>even<%0> one day in the month of M<193>gha (Jan.-Feb.).

@NT = a<218><219><193>k<218>ar<200>
@N1 = (`the eight-syllabled [mantra]')
Hindu religious tradition stresses the great importance of `mantra-japa' ç
or repetition of the divine name or sacred formula. There are several ç
such names and formulae which must be received in a ceremonial way ç
from a competent person, called guru or spiritual preceptor. This ç
is known as `d<200>k<218><193>' or initiation. The repetition of these ç
divine names and sacred formulae done as per the injunctions of the ç
guru can give any desired fruit.
Among the more well-known of suchmantras is the `a<218><219><193>k<218>ar<200>,' ç
the eight-syllabled mantra: o<221> namo n<193>r<193>ya<207><193>ya, ç
`Obeisance to N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, the Supreme Lord!'
The first syllable Om (also called `pra<207>ava') is the most common ç
and widely used word-symbol for Brahman or God, the Supreme Spirit. ç
It is composed of three letters a, u and m. In the Vai<218><207>avite ç
tradition of R<193>m<193>nuja (<F51320MS>A. D.<W1> 1017<192>1037), <F255MI>a ç
stands for N<193>r<193>ya<207>a/Vi<218><207>u, u for Lak<218>m<200>, ç
his Consort and m for the j<200>va or the individual soul. It thus ç
represents the totality of the N<193>r<193>ya<207>a-principle viz., ç
God (the Supreme independent Reality), his Power and the souls (who ç
are depen-dent realities).
The word `N<193>r<193>ya<207>a' (of `n<193>r<193>ya<207><193>ya') ç
that stands for God, the Supreme Reality, is interpreted in several ç
ways of which three are more important: (1) One who has made the causal ç
waters his abode; (2)One who has made the human beings (or all living ç
beings) his abode; (3) one who has become the abode for human beings ç
(or all living beings). The first is an explanation from the mythological ç
standpoint wherein he is depicted as resting on the serpent <185>e<218>a ç
or °di·e<218>a, in the k<218>r<200>rasamudra or the ocean of milk.The ç
second and the third depict him as the immanent and the transcendent ç
principle of creation.
The word `nama<199>' which means obeisance, also signifies `not mine' ç
(but thine) (na = not, ma<199> = mine).
A minor Upani<218>ad called N<193>r<193>ya<207>a Upani<218>ad deals ç
with this mantra and the fruits of its repetition which include the ç
destruction of sins and reaching Vaiku<207><219>ha, the Perfect Abode ç
of N<193>r<193>ya<207>a.

Traditional Hinduism has always considered certain objects and living ç
beings as `ma<209>gala' or auspicious. Coming across them by chance, ç
seeing them, receiving them as gifts, giving them as gifts or honouring ç
them†all these (depending upon the type of object) have been deemed ç
to produce auspiciousness.
@EMERGENCY = `A<218><219>ama<209>gala' is a term often used in the ç
religious works to indicate eight such objects of auspiciousness, ç
though there is no unanimity among the lists given. These objects ç
may be necessary on important occasions as the coronation of a king, ç
or they may be depicted as motifs in architecture. In a few rare cases ç
as in a vrata (religious vow) they represent the objects to be gifted.
@EMERGENCY = The a<218><219>ama<209>galas are: lion, bull, serpent ç
or elephant, pitcher, c<193>mara (cauri made of the bushy hairs of ç
a yak's tail) or a hand-fan, flag, trumpet or drum and lamp.
@EMERGENCY = As per another list, they are: a br<193>hma<207>a, cow, ç
fire, gold, ghee (butter-oil), the sun, water and a king.

@N1 = (`the heart or the<R>ç
essence of the [science of] eight limbs')
°yurveda or the `science of longevity' is a very ancient health science ç
having its origins in the Veda itself. It is sometimes called `A<218><219><193><209>ga' ç
since it has eight limbs (a<218><219>a = eight, a<209>ga = limb), ç
like ·alya (major surgery), ·<193>l<193>kya (minor surgery), k<193>ya-cikits<193> ç
(therapeutics) and so on. Among the few texts largely used by the ç
students of °yurveda, the A<218><219><193><209>gah<216>daya (sometimes ç
called A<218><219><193><209>ga-h<216>daya-sa<221>hit<193> also) ç
of V<193>gbha<219>a has an eminent place.
A<218><219><193><209>gah<216>daya is a basic extant work on °yurveda, ç
one of the three such works known as B<216>hattray<200>, the other ç
two being the Sa<221>hit<193>s of Caraka and Su·ruta.
Two V<193>gbha<219>as have been known to the historians of °yurveda, ç
one the author of A<218><219><193><209>gasa<209>graha and the other ç
of A<218><219><193><209>gah<216>daya. Though opinion is divided ç
as to whether the two V<193>gbha<219>as are identical or different, ç
most of the scholars are inclined towards the view that V<193>gbha<219>a ç
II was a different person and was the grandson of V<193>gbha<219>a ç
I. He was the son of one Si<221>ha Gupta and a disciple of Avalokite·vara. ç
He probably lived in the 7th/8th centuries <F51320MS>A. D.<W1>
The work, composed in anu<218><219>ubh verses, comprises of six `sth<193>nas' ç
or sections. S<220>trasth<193>na, the first, consists of 30 chapters ç
and deals with many fundamental concepts of the science and prelimi- ç
naries common to the other sections. <185>ar<200>rasth<193>na, the ç
second, spread over 6chapters deals with anatomy and physio-logy. ç
Nid<193>nasth<193>na, the third, comprising 16 chapters deals with ç
pathology. Cikits<193>-sth<193>na, the fourth, deals with therapeutics ç
in its 21 chapters. Kalpasth<193>na, the fifth, has 6 chapters on ç
toxicology. Uttarasth<193>na, the last, is a long section spread ç
over 40 chapters and deals with a number of miscellaneous  topics  like  paediatrics, ç
mental diseases, diseases of the eye, the E.N.T., poisons and their ç
antidotes, venereal diseases as also virilification.
An  elaborate  discussion  on  the chemistry of digestion and prescription ç
of several medicines prepared out of metals like gold, silver, copper, ç
tin and lead is one of the specialities of this work.
As many as 36 commentaries (both in Sanskrit and in vernaculars) have ç
been listed by scholars on this work. Out of them, 11 are not available ç
now. Of the rest, the Sarv<193><209>gasundar<200> of Aru<207>adatta ç

The Yoga system of Pata<210>jali (200 <F51320P10MSC1>B.C.<W1>) recommends ç
a graded practice of eight limbs or steps for controlling the mind ç

@NT = a<218><219>ap<193>·as

The tantras, the secondary scriptures advocating the worship of the ç
Divine Mother, give a list of the `a<218><219>ap<193>·as' or the eight ç
`bonds' or `fetters' which obstruct our spiritual progress. They are: ç
gh<216><207><193> (pity), lajj<193> (bashfulness), bhaya (fear), ·a<209>k<193> ç
(doubt), jugups<193> (aversion), kula (family), ·<200>la (conduct, ç
uprightness) and j<193>ti (birth or caste).
While approaching God all these† though they may be virtues under ç
certain conditions†should be given up. For instance, lajj<193> or ç
bashfulness, is necessary in civilized society. But while dancing, ç
taking the name of God, there should be no lajj<193>.
There are variations in the lists we get. Other items that find a ç
place in such lists are: m<193>na (honour), t<216><218><193> (desire), ç
k<193>ma (lust) and lobha (greed).
@NT = a<218><219>asiddhis
@N1 = (`eight supernatural powers')
Works on Yoga describe various `siddhis'  or  supernatural  powers  that ç
accrue to one who follows their methods. Pata<210>jali in his well-known ç
Yogas<220>tras has devoted the whole of the third chapter to describing ç
such siddhis apart from dealing with them in parts of the second and ç
fourth chapters also.
Of the several such powers described, a group of eight, has been specially ç
desig- nated as `a<218><219>asiddhis' or eight supernatural powers. ç
They generally go together. They are: a<207>im<193> (power to assume ç
minute forms), mahim<193> (power to expand to huge proportions), garim<193> ç
(power to grow heavy), laghim<193> (power to become light or weightless), ç
pr<193>pti (capacity to obtain eventhe most difficult things), pr<193>k<193>mya ç
(having irresistible will), <200>·it<216>tva (perfect mastery over ç
the body, senses and, capa-city to create or destroy outside objects) ç
and va·itva (full control over the movement of physical objects) (vide ç
3.45).
The list varies from work to work. The other powers that are sometimes ç
included (the total of course, being always eight)  are:  k<193>m<193>vas<193>yitva  (power  of ç
immediate fulfilment of desires), prak<193>ma-v<216><218><219>i (power ç
to bring rain at will), ak<216><218><219>a-pacya (power to get crops ç
without culti- vation), <220>h<193> (capacity to acquire knowledge ç
without a teacher) and so on.
Pata<210>jali  himself  administers  a warning that these powers are ç
incidental in spiritual life and will prove to be formidable  obstacles  to  self-realization ç
(Yogas<220>tras 3.37).

One of the great sages whose name has been associated with a well-known ç
work of Advaita philosophy, the A<218><219><193>- vakrag<200>t<193>, ç
A<218><219><193>vakra was the son of the sage Kahola. While yet in ç
the womb, the baby-sage is said to have laughed at the wrong intonation ç
of the Vedas by his father, incurred his wrath and was cursed by him ç
to be born with a body crooked in eight places. Hence the name `A<218><219><193>vakra.'
A scholar, Bandi by name, of the court of the king Janaka, had defeated ç
Kahola and had got him imprisoned in water. When A<218><219><193>vakra ç
came to know of the tragedy that had befallen his father, he went ç
to the court of Janaka, vanquished Bandi in disputation and rescued ç
his father Kahola. At his instance, who was now highly pleased with ç
his son, A<218><219><193>vakra took bath in the river Sama<209>g<193> ç
(also called Madhuvil<193>) and got rid of all the physical defects.
Another well-known sage of the Upani<218>ads, <185>vetaketu, the son ç
of Gautama °ru<207>i was the uncle of A<218><219><193>vakra.
The work A<218><219><193>vakrag<200>t<193>, also known as A<218><219><193>vakra ç
Sa<221>hit<193>, contains 298 verses in the simple anu<218><219>ubh ç
metre, spread over 20 chapters. Most of the chapters are very small. ç
The 18th chapter alone, however, contains 100 verses.
The book, which often gives the description of the <193>tman in hyperbolic ç
terms stresses that it can be realized here and now. Disciplines like ç
renouncing the desires for the pleasures of life, cultivating virtues ç
like forgiveness, kindness and truth are advocated. There is a beautiful ç
description of the man of knowledge in the 17th chapter. Supreme detachment ç
is a special characteristic of his. But it is difficult to recognize ç
him since he often lives like an ordinary person. Only another man ç
of knowledge can recognize him.
@NT = a<218><219><193>vara<207>as
@N1 = (`eight coverings')
V<200>ra·aivism or the Li<209>g<193>yata cult is a form of <185>aivism. ç
Basava (12th century) (also called Basava<207><207>a or Basave·vara) ç
was the reorganizer of this cult, if not the founder. The followers ç
of this cult are seen mostly in the Karnataka State.
`A<218><219><193>vara<207>a' is the second aspect of the practice ç
of this cult, the first being `pa<210>c<193>c<193>ra.' `°vara<207>a' ç
means protective covering. The Li<209>g<193>yata cult recognizes eight ç
such protective coverings. They are: guru (spiritual teacher), li<209>ga ç
(emblem of <185>iva), ja<209>gama (roving ascetic), p<193>dodaka (water ç
sanctified by the touch of the feet of the guru or the ja<209>gama), ç
pras<193>da (food sanctified by the guru or the ja<209>gama), bhasma ç
(sacred ashes), rudr<193>k<218>a (rosary of the rudr<193>k<218>a beads) ç
and mantra (mystic formula).
Guru is the spiritual teacher who initiates the novice into the mysteries ç
of the V<200>ra·aiva cult. Li<209>ga is the emblem of Lord <185>iva, ç
a concrete symbol of the Supreme, given to the initiate by the guru ç
at the time of initiation. The disciple is expected to wear it on ç
his body always and worship it at the appointed hour. Ja<209>gama ç
is any roving ascetic of the V<200>ra·aiva faith who should be treated ç
as equal to the guru. The water with which the feet of the guru or ç
the ja<209>gama are washed or is sanctified by the touch of their ç
feet, is p<193>dodaka. Any food that is offered to them and sanctified ç
by their touch is pras<193>da. P<193>dodaka and pras<193>da are to ç
be consumed by the initiated devo- tees. Bhasma or the sacred ashes ç
should be smeared on the body at the appropriate places (like forehead, ç
arms and so on). Rudr<193>k<218>a or the rosary of rudr<193>k<218>a ç
beads is to be used for keeping count of the japa of the mantra or ç
the mystic formula (`nama· ·iv<193>ya') received from the guru during ç
initiation. The rudr<193>k<218>a rosary may also be worn on the body.
These eight coverings act as shields against impurities of the body ç
and mind,and protect the V<200>ra·aiva from the onslaughts of sin.

@NT = A<218><219>avasus
@N1 = (`the Eight Vasus')
The <184>gveda Sa<221>hit<193>, the basic scripture of Hinduism, ç
contains several beauti-ful hymns addressed to gods like Indra. These ç
Vedic gods are usually enumerated as thirty-three, among whom the ç
`A<218><219>avasus' or `Eight Vasus' form the first group.
The Vasus are a class of deities, chiefly known as attendants of Indra. ç
The word `Vasu' is derived from the root `vas' (`to dwell', `to cause ç
to dwell,' `to shine') and hence the `Vasus' are deities representing ç
all spheres of extension or space, and height. They are personifications ç
of nature and natural phenomena.
The eight Vasus are: Dhar<193> (the earth), Anala (the fire), Ap (the ç
waters), Anila (the wind), Dhruva (the polestar), Soma (the moon), ç
Prabh<193>sa (the dawn), and Praty<220><218>a (the light).
According to the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a (1.15) the A<218><219>avasus ç
were the eight sons of Vasu, the wife of Dharma, and one of the ten ç
daughters of Dak<218>a Praj<193>pati. The Mah<193>bh<193>rata (1.99) ç
says that one of them was born on earth as Bh<200><218>ma due to a ç
curse.
@NT = asteya
@N1 = (`non-stealing')
The Hindu scriptures have time and again stressed the importance of ç
strict ethical life as a pre-condition to spiritual enlightenment. ç
A strict ethical life is essential even for social harmony and peace.
Among  the  few  cardinal  ethical principles delineated in these ç
works, `asteya' or `non-stealing' is also one. The Yogas<220>tras ç
(2.30) of Pata<210>jali (200 <F51320MS>B. C.<W1>) has included this under ç
the first a<209>ga or limb of yoga, viz., yama. It is the third in ç
the series of five such qualities.
Though `steya' means `stealing' and hence `asteya' means `non-stealing,' ç
its connotation goes much beyond this restric-ted sense. All actions ç
of appropriation of others' things, not sanctioned by the scriptures, ç
should be brought under this head.
Since greed has been recognized as a natural infirmity of the human ç
mind (vide B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka Upani<218>ad 5.2.2 and ®·<193>v<193>sya ç
Upani<218>ad 1) it is no wonder that the scriptures have laid such ç
an emphasis on `asteya.'
Rules regarding ahi<221>s<193> (non-injury), asteya and so on, may ç
be relaxed under certain extraordinary conditions sanctioned by the ç
scriptures. Thus, stealing of food is permitted when a person is dying ç
of hunger during famine and is unable to procure food in any other ç
way. But for persons who have totally dedicated themselves for spiritual ç
enlightenment, no exemptions are allowed (vide Yogas<220>tras 2.31). ç
For them, it is a `mah<193>vrata' or `great vow.'

Throughout the human history, disposal of the dead and the rites connected ç

death is as much an awe-inspiring wonder of nature as birth. The Hindu ç
scriptures which look upon the whole life of a man as a yaj<210>a ç
or a sacrifice, have treated the subject of dying, death and after-death ç
rites as a part of religion. The rites should be conducted with proper ç
religious fervour so that the soul of the dead gets peace.
The rite of `asthisa<210>cayana' or `collec- ting the bones' (of the ç
dead) is performed only in cases where the body has been cremated. ç
The nearest relative of the dead person, with the help of some elders, ç
usually old men in odd numbers, collects the charred remains of the ç
bones in a specified way. The rite includes circumambulation of the ç
place of cremation, sprink-ling milk with water with the branch of ç
a ·am<200> tree (Prosopis specigera), collection of bones from the ç
feet to the head andfilling them in an urn. Appropriate mantras from ç
the <184>gveda have to be chanted during the whole operation. The ç
urn is then buried in a suitable spot, after which the relative takes ç
a bath and performs a ·r<193>ddha or obsequial rite.
But the most common practice in the modern days is to cast the bones ç
in the waters of holy rivers like the Ga<209>g<193> or the sea. The ç
Vi<218><207>udharmas<220>tras (19.11-12) approves and recommends ç
this practice as better.
This rite is not performed for boys whose upanayana ceremony has not ç
been performed.

The word `<193>stika,' derived from the verb `asti' (`exists') generally ç
denotes anyone who believes in the existence of God and higher worlds ç
like heaven, immortality of the soul, theory of karma and reincarnation ç
and so on. Sometimes the word is used in the more restricted sense ç
of one who believes in the authority of the Vedas. In this sense, ç
the six well-known systems of Indian philosophy are called `<193>stika' ç
as opposed to the C<193>rv<193>ka, the Jaina and the Bauddha systems, ç
which are designated as `n<193>stika' or `non-believing.'

When the king Par<200>k<218>it, the grandson of the P<193><207><195>ava ç
prince Arjuna died of snakebite, his son Janamejaya performed a sarpay<193>ga ç
or snake sacrifice in which hundreds of innocent snakes were being ç
immolated. The final offering was to be Tak<218>aka, the king of snakes ç
of the nether world, the chief `culprit' who had bitten and killed ç
Par<200>k<218>it. Just then there appeared on the scene a young sage, ç
°st<200>ka by name, the son of the Jaratk<193>ru couple, and stopped ç
the atrocious sacrifice. His mother was the sister of V<193>suki. ç
He had been specially deputed to save the life of V<193>suki and all ç
his subjects as also his followers, with his sweet speech and convincing ç

The Indian philosophical systems known as `dar·anas' are generally ç
divided into two groups: the <193>stika and the n<193>stika. The word ç
`<193>stika' is usually interpreted as `believing in the authority ç
of the Vedas,' which accept the existence of God, the soul, heaven ç
and other worlds, the doctrines of karma and rebirth and so on. Hence ç
the well-known six systems of philosophy†the `<218>a<195>-dar·anas'†are ç
grouped under the term `<193>stika'. The three systems of C<193>rv<193>ka, ç
Jaina and Bauddha, considered as heretical and heterodox, are classified ç
under the term `n<193>stika.'

@NT = a<218><219>ottara·atan<193>ma-stotra
@N1 =  (`hymn<R>ç
containing 108 [names]')
Hymnology of Hinduism is as old as the <184>gveda itself. As the ç
religion evolved and its influence spread, gradually absorbing and ç
integrating various cults, sects and movements into its fold, the ç
number of deities of the Hindu pantheon also increased. Consequently ç
hymnology also grew to voluminous proportions.
Among the various types of such hymns, or `stotras' as they are called, ç
`the a<218><219>ottara·ata' as also the `sahasran<193>ma' group plays ç
a more significant role. It can be used not only for chanting but ç
also for offering flowers and other objects used in worship, as a ç
part of the ritualistic process, the latter being the more common.
The word `a<218><219>ottara·ata' indicates the number 108. In the ç
Hindu mystic and ritualistic traditions, this number, 108 (as also ç
1008), has acquired great significance. The several explanations offered ç
for this are more academic and mystical than logically convincing.
The a<218><219>ottara·ata hymns are always composed in the simple ç
anu<218><219>ubh or ·loka metre. They are generally preceded by certain ç
preliminaries like `ny<193>sas' or conse-cration of one's body, paying ç
homage to the <216><218>i, the sage through whom the hymn was revealed, ç
the chandas or the deity presiding over the metre in which the hymn ç
is composed, the devat<193> or the deity to whom the hymn is addressed, ç
and, viniyoga or the purpose for which the hymn is chanted. There ç
is also a dhy<193>na·loka, a verse in which the form of the deity ç
is described in detail to facilitate meditation.
The hymn itself contains 108 names of the deity, the names dealing ç
with the form, qualities and exploits of the deity (based on the mythological ç
accounts).
When the names are used individually in p<220>j<193> or arcan<193> ç
(ritualistic worship) they are repeated one after another, but in ç
the `caturth<200> vibhakti' or dative case, adding the word `nama<199>,' ç
`obeisance' at the end.
For instance, the a<218><219>ottara·atan<193>ma-stotra  of  <185>iva  ç
begins  thus:  ·ivo mahe·vara<199> ·ambhu<199>. When these names ç
are used in worship, they are repeated as: ·iv<193>ya nama<199>, ç
mahe·var<193>ya nama<199>, ·ambhave nama<199> and so on.
Later Hinduism has attached great significance to these a<218><219>ottara·atan<193>ma ç
and sahasran<193>ma hymns. Their repetition is believed to yield many ç
desired results. They are quite popular in the modern Hindu society ç
and are widely used in the temples.

sinful). The former bring good results whereas the latter cause evil ç
effects. But the karmas done by a perfected yogin are neither k<216><218><207>a ç
nor ·ukla, since he never commits sins; and offers the fruits of all ç
his meritorious deeds to ®·vara or God. Hence his karma is known as ç

@NT = asuras
@N1 = (`beneficent being,' `those addicted to sense-pleasures')
The metamorphosis of the meaning of the word `asura,' from `beneficent ç
god' to `malevolent spirit or being' in the Vedic and post-Vedic literature ç
is rather baffling. In early Vedic literature (vide <184>gveda 1<%12>.<%0>35<%18>.<%0>7; ç
1.131.1) the term denotes the Supreme Spirit. Derived probably from ç
the root `as' (`to exist'), or `asu' (`pr<193><207>a or life-force'), ç
it must have originally meant the `Self-existent Being' or the `Being ç
of life-force and power.' It is in this sense that the well-known ç
Vedic deities Indra and Varu<207>a have been called `asuras' (ibid ç
1.54.3; 1.24.14).
But soon the connotation changed. The Nirukta, the standard dictionary ç
of Vedic  terms,  defines  the  `asuras'  as those `who are not satisfied ç
in their positions,' `the ever-fickle' and `those who are deprived ç
of their positions by the suras or devas.' In later literature, mostly ç
the epics and the pur<193><207>as, they are posited as  `a-suras'  or  `anti-gods,'  malevolent ç
beings, ever opposed to the `suras' or `devas,' the `beings of goodness ç
and light'. In this sense they are pictured as highly ambitious and ç
aggressive people, rich, civilized and powerful, but ever bent on ç
conquest and self-aggrandizement. And precisely because of this trait ç
of theirs, they are ever in conflict with the devas representing the ç
forces of goodness, refine- ment and culture.
Though conflicts between the devas and the asuras are legion, there ç
have also been occasions when they have cooperated, as for instance, ç
in the case of churning of the ocean to get am<216>ta or nectar. There ç
have been great asura kings like Prahl<193>da, Bali, <185>ambara and ç
B<193><207>a who were devotees of God (Vi<218><207>u or <185>iva).
In the mythological lore, the devas and the asuras are depicted as ç
the children of the same father, the sage Ka·yapa, from his two wives ç
Aditi and Diti. Sometimes, the asuras have been described as having ç
been born out of the body of Brahm<193> or Praj<193>pati, the Creator.
Whatever be the manner of their origin, the devas and the asuras appear ç
more to be the archetypes of the good and the not-so-good beings in ç
creation.
@SPACE1 = 
In the earlier religious literature, the daityas and the d<193>navas, ç
positively more malevolent beings, had been placed below the asuras. ç
But gradually, the asuras were degraded and identified completely ç
with the former.
One of the very special powers the asuras seemed to possess and excel ç
in, was sorcery and magic.
Some Western scholars of Indology hazard the guess that the asuras ç
were the hostile native rulers and tribes who were opposed to the ç
°ryans. Due to lack of conclusive evidence to clinch the issue, it ç
is difficult to accept such theories. The word may be more etymological ç
and symbolical than historical, racial or social. It is significant ç
to note that <185>a<209>kara (8thcent. <F51320P10MSC1>A.<|>D.<W1>) the great ç
philosopher mystic,  defines  the  asuras  as  `those addicted to ç
selfish bodily pleasures' (<F255P255MIC255>vide B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka ç

@NT = °·val<193>yana
Each of the four Vedas has several `·<193>kh<193>s,' branches or recensions. ç
The origin of these ·<193>kh<193>s probably lies in the fact that ç
each of the principal sages like Paila or Vai·amp<193>yana, who transmitted ç
the Vedas, had several disciples. These disciples or their successors ç
did some editing and readjustments of the Vedic mantras to suit the ç
needs of the rites which they performed and upon which the local culture ç
too, sometimes, had its effect. This naturally led to the birth of ç
these recensions.
The name of °·val<193>yana is connected with the <184>gveda as one ç
of the authors of its ·<193>kh<193>s. Not much is known of this °·val<193>yana ç
except that he was the disciple of <185>aunaka. Though one Kausalya ç
°·val<193>yana is mentioned in the Pra·na Upani<218>ad (1.1; 3.1) ç
and an A·vala in the B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka  Upani<218>ad  (3.1.1)  it  is ç
very difficult to establish any connection between them and this °·val<193>yana. ç
The Anu·<193>sanaparva (7.54) of the Mah<193>-bh<193>rata  mentions  one  °·val<193>yana  as ç
belonging to the gotra or lineage of Vi·v<193>mitra, another great ç
name among the sages. Some scholars opine that he is the same °·val<193>yana, ç
the author of the <184>gvedic recension.
The °·val<193>yana recension of the <184>gveda is almost identical ç
with the <185><193>kala recension except that the latter recognizes ç
as canonical, the V<193>lakhilya supplementary hymn.
One or two works of °·val<193>yana, outof the four attributed to ç
him, are extant now: °·val<193>yana <185>rautas<220>tras and °·val<193>yana ç
G<216>hyas<220>tras.
The °·val<193>yana <185>rautas<220>tras, which closely follows the ç
Aitareya Br<193>hma<207>a, consists of twelve chapters. Each chapter ç
is further subdivided into `kha<207><195>as' or subsections, the total ç
number of such kha<207><195>as being 164. Each kha<207><195>a is mostly ç
in the form of a long sentence. The whole work, since it belongs to ç
the <184>gvedic group, deals mainly with the duties of the `hot<216>,' ç
the priest connected with the chanting ofthe <184>gvedic mantras ç
during the sacrificial rites. The sacrifices and rites dealt with ç
in this work are: Dar·ap<220>r<207>am<193>sa, Agny<193>dh<193>na, ç

The followers of this work are mostly in the southern regions of the ç
river God<193>var<200>.
The °·val<193>yana G<216>hyas<220>tras consists of four chapters ç
divided into 48 `ka<207><195>ik<193>s' or subsections. The topics ç

@NT = A·vamedha
@N1 = (`[that in which] a horse is immolated')
@EMERGENCY = A·vamedha is one of the most anci-ent, but major, sacrifices ç
mentioned in the Vedic literature. It is mentioned in the <184>gveda ç
(1.162; 163) and described in the <185>atapatha Br<193>hma<207>a ç
(13.1-5) and the Taittir<200>ya Br<193>hma<207>a (3.8.9). It derives ç
its name from the fact that an `a·va' or a horse is made the `medha' ç
or animal forimmolation. Only emperors and very powerful kings who ç
desired sovereignty could afford to perform it. It belongs to the ç
`Ah<200>na' group of Soma sacrifices, i.e., Soma sacrifices in which ç
Soma is pressed for more than one day; and, this can be from two to ç
twelve days.
@EMERGENCY = The rite begins on the 8th or 9th day of the bright half ç
of the month of Ph<193>lguna, when the horse, which must be all white ç
in colour with dark spots, is bound, bathed and consecrated near the ç
fire. The animal is then let off to wander about at will for a year, ç
guarded by an escort of four hundred armed men, including one hundred ç
princes. The kings or chieftains of the places which the horseenters, ç
should either accept the sovereignty of the sacrificer and pay contributions ç
or tie up the horse and face an armed conflict. In case the challenger ç
wins, the sacrifice will get nullified. Even the death or disease ç
of the horse will result in the same and the sacrificer will have ç
to restart the whole process with a new horse. Meanwhile the sacrificer ç
is expected to perform a number of rites everyday, during the period ç
the horse is away.
After the successful completion of the expedition and the return of ç
the horse, the regular rites of the sacrifice commence. It is a Soma ç
sacrifice of three days' duration. The horse is immolated on the second ç
day, along with a number of other victims, wild and tame, from the ç
elephant to the bee. Before the carcass of the horse is cut up, the ç
chief queen lies down beside it (by way of fertility spell) while ç
an obscene dialogue between the priests and the other women of the ç
king's harem isenacted. Before theoffering of the omentum, `brahmodya' ç
riddles (theological dialogues where questions and riddles are propounded ç
and answered) are proposed and   solved.   The   concluding   bath ç
(avabh<216>tha-sn<193>na) takes place on the third day.
The sacrifice involves many subordinate rites and large quantities ç
of gifts are given away to the priests and others.
Though long lists of kings who had performed the A·vamedha have been ç
given in the Vedic works already referred to, the sacrifice itself ç
seems to have become rare even by the time of these works, since they ç
call it as `utsanna' (`gone out of vogue'). It appears to be a curious ç
mixture of popular religions, tribal and symbolical elements, inextricably ç
mixed up and a remnant of a hoary past.
During the period of recorded history, Pu<218>yamitra  <185>u<209>ga  (2nd  cent.  <MS>B. ç

The king of Kekaya State, the father of Kaikey<200> (the youngest ç

Popular Hindu religion considers that visits to places of pilgrimage ç
result in great merit as also destruction of sins. One of the minor ç
places of pilgrimage (generally called `t<200>rtha' or `t<200>rthak<218>etra,') ç
is A·vat<200>rtha situated near Kany<193>kubja (the modern Kannauj ç
in Uttar Pradesh). It is stated in the Mah<193>bh<193>rata (Anu·<193>sanaparva ç
4.17) that when the sage <184>c<200>ka wanted to marry Satyavat<200>, ç
the daughter of the king G<193>dhi (father of the famous sage Vi·v<193>mitra) ç
he demanded 100 white horses, with one ear black in colour, as bridal ç

A·vattha (Ficus religiosa) is one ofthe highly revered trees in ç
popular Hinduism. It is said to have issued forth from Indra, the ç
king of gods. According to another version of mythology, it is a manifestation ç
of Vi<218><207>u. K<216><218><207>a says in theBhagavadg<200>t<193> ç
(10.26) that he is the a·vattha among the trees. Since the gods sit ç
under a celestial tree (vide Atharvaveda 5.3), holy men of the earth ç
too sit under it here. Its shade is said to confer miraculous powers ç
like understanding the language of animals or remembering former births. ç
Childless women worship it and circumambulate it with the hope and ç
faith of being granted children.
In the scriptures, the eternal tree of life is compared to an a·vattha, ç

was the only son of Dro<207><193>c<193>rya, the teacher of the P<193><207><195>ava ç
and the Kaurava princes. As soon as he was born, he is said to have ç
neighed like a horse. Hence the name.
Though brought up in poverty he was well-trained by his father in ç
the sacred lore, secular sciences and the art of war. His irascible ç
temper often made him stray from the path of dharma. He earned ignominy ç
by killing the sons of Draupad<200> while they were asleep and by ç
trying to destroy the baby Par<200>k<218>it in the womb of Uttar<193>, ç
the wife of Abhimanyu and the future heir to the empire. He was punished ç
by Bh<200>ma, the second of the P<193><207><195>avas and cursed by ç
<185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a to suffer from serious diseases for ç
a very long time. Though a little odd, he has been reckoned as one ç
of seven `Cira<210>j<200>vins' or `those who live forever.'

@NT = A·vins
@N1 = (`related to the horses')
They are twin-deities that are given an important place in the <184>gveda. ç
At least 50 s<220>ktas are in praise of them. They are always described ç
and eulogized together. Being considered as the twin sons of S<220>rya ç
(the Sun-god) and his spouse Sa<221>j<210><193> when they had assumed ç
the horse-form, they have been described as `A·vinau,' or A·v<200>ni-kum<193>ras ç
(a·va = horse).
It is rather difficult to say what aspect of the powers of nature ç
they represent. That they stand for night and day, or earth and sky, ç
or moon and sun, is the opinion of some scholars. There is also one ç
view that they were originally two kings who were gradually elevated ç
to godhood.
They are pictured as semi-darkness before dawn. They pervade this ç
world with moisture and light. They are eternally young and handsome. ç
In fact, they are the youngest of gods.
Their chief characteristic is that they are continuously striving ç
to do good to others. They are expert physicians and surgeons. They ç
know the arts of healing, rejuvenation and even plastic surgery. When ç
supplicated, they grant children, food, wealth, health and protection ç
from enemies. Hence they are invariably invoked during the Vedic sacrifices.
Their many exploits like granting youth to the old sage Cyavana, sight ç
to the young Upamanyu who had lost his eyesight, children to M<193>dr<200>, ç
the younger queen of P<193><207><195>u are also described in the mythological ç
literature.
Tradition recognizes them as important teachers of °yurveda, the science ç
of health and longevity.

light of the gems on the hoods of the great serpents that live here.
The denizens of this region are endowed with eternal youth and beauty. ç
They are ever immersed in amorous sports and pleasures.
@NT = Atharvan
The word is probably derived from `athar,' an obsolete word for fire, ç
and hence means a priest connected with the worship of fire. According ç
to Vedic mythology, Atharvan was son of Brahm<193>, the Creator. He ç
first brought down fire from heaven and offered soma into it with ç
the recitation of appropriate mantras learnt from his father. He is ç
sometimes considered as the propagator of the fourth Veda which is ç
hence called the Atharvaveda or the Atharva<207>aveda. His wife ç
was <185><193>nti, the daughter of Kardama Praj<193>pati. He is sometimes ç
identified with A<209>giras, called Atharv<193><209>giras, and is ç
considered as the father of Agni, the fire-god.
This word, as also the word Atharv<193><209>giras, is sometimes used ç
to indicate the descendants of this sage.
The word Atharvan also refers to the hymns of the Atharvaveda.
@NT = °tharva<207>a-jyoti<218>a
@N1 = (`Science of heavenly<R>ç
bodies, belonging to the Atharvaveda')
Jyoti<218>a or astronomy is one of the six Ved<193><209>gas or subsidiary ç
sciences that help us to understand the Vedas. Since performance of ç
sacrifices was the most important aspect of the Vedic religion and ç
it was related to different periods of the year as also time and the ç
position of the stars, a separate science called `Jyoti<218>a' was ç
evolved in course of time. Each of the four Vedas developed its own ç
Jyoti<218>a.
The work °tharva<207>a-jyoti<218>a as extant today comprises 162 ç
verses and may be a recast of an earlier work. It is generally assigned ç
to the 2nd cent. <F51320MS>B. C.<W1> It deals with muh<220>rta (a particular ç
division of time), kara<207>a (an astrological division of day), yoga ç
(leading star of a lunar aste-rism; a variable division of time), ç
tithi (lunar day) and v<193>ra (day of the week). It is said to fall ç
outside the Vedic period but before the period of the Siddh<193>nta ç
calendar which divides the zodiac into twelve r<193>·is or signs. ç
It adopts a scheme of nak<218>atra astrology. It forms nine groups ç
of three nak<218>atras (asterisms) each, the total being 27. Information ç
is provided at length as to what should be done or not to be done ç
on the presence of the nine groups and their constituents.

@NT = Atharva·ikh<193> Upani<218>ad
This is a small Upani<218>ad belonging to the Atharvaveda. It is ç
in prose. It is divided into three sections containing twenty mantras.
Three sages†Pippal<193>da, A<209>giras and Sanatkum<193>ra†approach ç
the venerable Atharva<207>a and seek instructions from him on meditation. ç
Atharva<207>a teaches them meditation on Om or Pra<207>ava which is ç
the best symbol for Brahman, both in its higher and in its lower aspects. ç
The three parts of Om, viz., a, u and m, as also the last unseen ç
part, are described as representing the various aspects and levels ç
of creation. For instance, a represents the earth, the <184>gveda, ç
Brahm<193> and the deities known as Vasus. It also represents the ç
g<193>yatr<200> metre and the g<193>rhapatya fire. Similarly, u ç
stands for the intervening space between the earth and heaven, the ç
Yajurveda, Rudra, and the eleven subsi-diary deities also called ç
Rudras, as also the tri<218><219>ubh metre and the dak<218>i<207>a ç
fire. The syllable m indicates heaven, the S<193>maveda, Vi<218><207>u, ç
the deities called °dityas, the jagat<200> metre and the <193>havan<200>ya ç
fire. The last unseen half- syllable (`ardham<193>tr<193>') is the ç
symbol of the Atharvaveda, the `sa<221>vartaka' fire that destroys ç
creation at the end of the cycle and the deities called Maruts.
Meditation on this Pra<207>ava leads to liberation from rebirth.
@NT = Atharva·ira Upani<218>ad
This Upani<218>ad, as its very name indicates, belongs to the Atharvaveda. ç
It is also called Atharva·<200>r<218>a Upani<218>ad. It is classified ç
under minor Upani<218>ads and consists of seven sections in prose.
The first section describes how the gods went to the svargaloka (heaven) ç
and asked Rudra who he was. He replied that He was the primeval Supreme ç
Person and that whatever existed was He. The gods then, realizing ç
His supremacy, praised Him with their hands raised in adoration. The ç
second and the third sections contain their hymns of praise. The fourth ç
section defines and amplifies some of the epithets used in praising ç
Rudra. The fifth section contains some well-known <216>ks of the <184>gveda ç
and a description of the parts (a, u, m) of Om or Pra<207>ava, including ç
their symbology. The sixth section also contains some well-known mantras ç
of the <184>gveda and K<216><218><207>a Yajurveda. The last section ç
is a eulogy of the results one gets by a study of this Upani<218>ad.

The most ancient and basic scriptures of Hinduism are known as `Vedas.' ç
Derived from the root `vid' (= to know), they represent a vast body ç
of religio-spiritual knowledge transmitted orally from generation ç
to generation over the millennia. Hindu tradition ascribes to the ç
sage K<216><218><207>a-Dvaip<193>yana, better known as Vy<193>sa, ç
the systematization and editing of the vast Vedic literature with ç
a view to preserving it for the posterity. He is said to have divided ç
the Vedas into four parts and taught it to his four chief disciples ç
viz., Paila, Vai·amp<193>yana, Jaimini and Sumantu. These four Vedas ç
have been well-known as <184>gveda, Yajurveda, S<193>ma-veda and ç
Atharvaveda (vide Mah<193>bh<193>rata, °diparva 60.5; Bh<193>gavata ç
12.6.50).
The Atharvaveda, the last in the series, has also been called by ç
several other names: Atharva<207>aveda, Atharv<193><209>girasa, °<209>girasa, ç
Bh<216>gva<209>girasa, Bh<216>gu- vistara, Brahmaveda, Bhai<218>ajyaveda ç
and K<218>attraveda.
<W1%-1>The word `Atharvan,' probably derived<D%0> from `athar,' an ç
obsolete word for fire,might mean `the priest of fire.' So, Atharvan ç
may be the name of an ancient sage who `brought down fire from heaven' ç
and started the sacrificial rites here.
In the Hindu mythology, he is descri- bed as a son of Brahm<193>, ç
the Creator, who introduced fire-rituals with soma and other materials. ç
He is identified with A<209>giras and also called Atharv<193><209>girasa. ç
It is also possible that the <216><218>is of the clans of Atharvan, ç
A<209>giras, Bh<216>gu, Atharv<193><209>girasa and Brahman were the ç
`dra<218><219><193>ras' of this Veda, i.e., the sages to whom the ç
various hymns of this Veda were revealed. Hence the other names of ç
this Veda.
The title `Brahmaveda' could have been derived from the fact that ç
it was related to the priest brahm<193>, the fourth of the four priests, ç
the other three being hot<193>, adhvaryu and udg<193>t<193>, connected ç
with the first three Vedas in that order. In a more general sense ç
it can also mean the Veda that helps in the attainment of Brahman.
@SPACE1 = 
The two names `Bhai<218>ajyaveda' and `K<218>attraveda' have obviously ç
been derived from the subject matter of the Veda which contains quite ç
a bit of material on `bhai<218>ajya' (medicines and treatment) and ç
`k<218>attra' (the warrior-class known as the k<218>attriyas).
The Atharvaveda has some special features because of which it stands ç
a little apart from the other three Vedas, especi-ally the <184>gveda. ç
It deals more with the things here and now, than the hereafter, and, ç
the sacrifices which are a means to it. Major portion of this Veda ç
is concerned with diseases and their cure, rites for prolonging life, ç
rites for fulfilling one's desires, building construction, trade and ç
commerce, statecraft, penances and propitiatory rites and black-magic, ç
though high philosophical ideas, much nearer to the thought pattern ç
of the Upani<218>ads, are also to be found. Even the literary style ç
ismore sophisticated. Hence some scholars believe that this work ç
had not been admitted into the comity of Vedic literature for a long ç
time. It was perhaps considered as a `scripture of the masses,' not ç
fit enough for admission into the `elite-group;' and its sheer popularity ç
might have forced the leaders of the society into admitting it as ç
the fourth Veda and give its priests also an honourable place in sacrifices.
For the same reasons, it is opined that this Veda is chronologically ç
posterior to the other three Vedas. Some modern scholars like C. V. ç
Vaidya (vide History of Vedic Literature, p. 156) assign to it, ç
the period 3000 to 2500 <F51320MS>B. C.<W1> But, Vedic chronology is a rather ç
hazardous subject and it is very difficult to fix the periods precisely.
From the ancient times, nine ·<193>kh<193>s or branches of the Atharvaveda ç
(Sa<221>hit<193>) are known to have existed. However, only two of ç
them are extant: Pippal<193>da and <185>aunaka. Of these, it is the ç
latter that is available in a complete form.
@EMERGENCY = This Veda is divided into four `prap<193><219>hakas,' ç
comprising 20 `k<193><207><195>as.' Each k<193><207><195>a is again ç
sub-divided into `s<220>ktas' and these s<220>ktas, into `mantras.' ç
The details are as follows:
@TAB1 = Prap<193><219>hakas      K<193><207><195>as      S<220>ktas	Mantras<R>ç
<+><+><+>I		1 to 7	433	2030<+><R>ç
<+><+><+>II		8 to 12	45	 1573<+><R>ç
<+><+><+>III		13 to 18	43	1063<+><R>ç
<+><+><+>IV		19 & 20	 215	1411<+>
This gives us 6077 mantras in 736 s<220>ktas spread over 20 k<193><207><195>as ç
in 4 prap<193><219>hakas. However, due to the different methods adopted ç
in grouping or classi- fying, the number of s<220>ktas given by various ç
scholars have varied from 598 to 759. But there is no difference in ç
the number of the mantras.
@EMERGENCY = The last k<193><207><195>a, i.e., the 20th, has borrowed ç
heavily (to the tune of 90%) from the <184>gveda Sa<221>hit<193>. ç
It is opined that the k<193><207>das 19 and 20, sometimes termed `Khilak<193><207><195>a,' ç
are later additions to this Veda.
Coming to the subject matter of the Sa<221>hit<193> of this Veda, ç
we find that there is no systematic division of the same in the first ç
twelve k<193><207><195>as. The last two again, deal with miscellaneous ç
topics. A brief summary of the contents may now be attempted, under ç
eight subject headings:
@SB8.5 = 1.	Bhai<218>ajya S<220>ktas<|>:
@EMERGENCY = These s<220>ktas which deal with disea-ses, their causes ç
and cures, show a remarkable insight into the subject of health sciences. ç
That is why this Veda is considered to be the precursor of °yurveda ç
or the Science of health and longevity. Sometimes, °yurveda is listed ç
as an Upaveda or subsidiary of the Atharvaveda. These s<220>ktas ç
contain many prayers for health and longevity. The various names of ç
the parts of the body given here bespeak of an intimate knowledge ç
of human ana-tomy. Several diseases like fever, leuco-derma, leprosy, ç
jaundice, diabetes, dropsy, skin disorders, troubles of the ear, nose ç
and throat, fracture of bones, diseases of the heart and tuberculosis, ç
are mentioned and cures indicated. These diseases are caused by germs, ç
violation of the laws of nature, anger of deities and malevolent spirits ç
and sins committed previously. Apart from medicines and physical remedies, ç
use of chants and charms was also in plenty. A deep knowledge of the ç
herbs and their various medicinal properties can be inferred from ç
many of the mantras.
@SB8.5 = 2.	°yu<218>ya S<220>ktas<|>:
@EMERGENCY = These s<220>ktas contain supplications for longevity ç
and are to be uttered on auspicious occasions like caula (tonsure), ç
upanayana (investiture with the sacred thread), god<193>na (gifting ç
of cows) and soon. The desire to live the full span of life, viz., ç
100 years, is often expressed. One of the s<220>ktas (k<193><207><195>a ç
17) prescribes the wearing of the `rak<218><193>s<220>tra' (`thread ç
of protection') on the body to attain longevity.
@SB8.5 = 3.	Pau<218><219>ika S<220>ktas<|>:
Pu<218><219>i means worldly progress and welfare. These s<220>ktas ç
generally contain prayers for the blessings of deities like the Maruts, ç
Parjanya and others so that there can be good rains and crops, and, ç
works like house-building or agriculture or trade flourish well.
@SB8.5 = 4.	°bhic<193>rika S<220>ktas<|>:
If the Pau<218><219>ika S<220>ktas are intended to bring prosperity, ç
the °bhic<193>raka S<220>ktas are aimed at destroying or harming enemies ç
who obstruct our progress or try to destroy us. This is said to be ç
achieved by pleasing or appeasing certain deities or spirits and getting ç
one's wishes fulfilled through them. This technique is called `y<193>tu' ç
or `k<216>ty<193>.' The number of such s<220>ktas is rather large. ç
Destruction of one's enemies including the lovers of one's spouse, ç
annihilation of evil spirits, mesmerizing others through whom one ç
can get one's desires fulfilled†these are some of the topics dealt ç
with in these s<220>ktas. The word `k<216><218><207>endraj<193>la' ç
is sometimes used to indicate the type of black-magic rites depicted ç
here. As opposed to this, the auspicious rites described in the Pau<218><219>ika ç
S<220>ktas are called `·uklendraj<193>la.'
@SB8.5 = 5.	Pr<193>ya·citta S<220>ktas<|>:
These are concerned mainly with expiatory rites to offset the evil ç
effects that may come as a result of non-perfor-mance or wrong performance ç
of religious rites. Omens foreboding evil and the ritesnecessary ç
to combat them are also described.
@SB8.5 = 6.	Str<200>karma S<220>ktas<|>:
These s<220>ktas deal mainly with marri-age, love and allied topics. ç
Rites that help in regaining the lost love of one's spouse are also ç
described.
@SB8.5 = 7.	R<193>jakarma S<220>ktas<|>:
This section gives an account of the political system that obtained ç
during those days. The king used to be elected by the people. National ç
and social problems used to be discussed by or decided in a `samiti', ç
a parliament of the people. The R<193>japurohita (Chief Priest of ç
the State) had an enviable place in the affairs of the State. Prayers ç
for victory in war and hymns expressing devotion to the Motherland ç
given here are highly poetic and moving.
@SB8.5 = 8.	Brahma<207>ya S<220>ktas<|>:
These s<220>ktas unfold the nature of Brahman, the Absolute. The philosophical ç
ideas given here form a link between those of the <184>gveda and ç
of the Upani<218>ads.
God, the Absolute, is designated here by various names such as K<193>la, ç
Skambha, Ucchi<218><219>a and Vr<193>tya which are rather peculiar ç
to this Veda. From him the whole universe emerges and in him is it ç
established. He is the lord of the whole creation. The universe has ç
evolved out of him, because he willed it thus (vide 19.53.8). The ç
sun is a symbol of his power and is called `Rohita,' the `Red-One'. ç
He is identi-fied with God himself. This Absolute is also identified ç
with the °tman.
The word `Vr<193>tya' found in this section has nothing to do with ç
the people who had been without Vedic sacraments, the sense in which ç
the word has been used in the dharma·<193>stras. Here it repre-sents ç
Brahman, the Absolute.
The Atharvaveda Sa<221>hit<193> gives us an interesting picture ç
of the society of its times. The land in which the people lived extended ç
from G<193>ndh<193>ra (Afghanistan) to Magadha and A<209>ga (Bihar ç
and Bengal). The var<207>a system had been well established. The first ç
three va<216><207>as were called `°ryas' and the fourth as `<185><220>dras.' ç
But people lived in harmony. Kings were powerful. Trade and commerce ç
were prosperous though agriculture was their main stay. There are ç
hints to show that the br<193>hma<207>as were powerful and had sometimes ç
to face the wrath of the k<218>attriya kings. The cow was highly venerated ç
and god<193>na (gift of cows) was considered highly meritorious. There ç
are references to the R<193>jas<220>ya sacrifice and wars among kings. ç
The institute of marriage was very similar to that of the <184>gvedic ç
times; so also the obsequial rites.
No °ra<207>yaka of the Atharvaveda has come to light so far. Only ç
one Br<193>hma<207>a has been discovered, the Gopatha Br<193>hma<207>a.
The three well-known Upani<218>ads† the Pra·na, the Mu<207><195>aka ç
and the M<193><207><195><220>kya†belong to this Veda.
(For details see under the respective titles.)
In conclusion it can be said that the Atharvaveda forms an important ç
landmark in Vedic literature.
@NT = atheism
Atheism of some sort or the other has always existed in Hindu thought. ç
There are clear references to it in the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a and ç
the Mah<193>bh<193>rata, including  the  Bhagavadg<200>t<193>.  But,  holding ç
atheistic beliefs has never been a bar to remaining within the Hindu ç
fold.
If the word `atheism' is interpreted as non-belief in the existence ç
of God, then, even the Vedic systems like the S<193><209>khya-dar·ana ç
and the M<200>m<193><221>s<193>-dar·ana, have to be dubbed as atheistic. ç
But the word,the Sanskrit equivalent of which is `n<193>stikat<193>,' ç
is generally accepted to mean non-acceptance of the authority of the ç
Vedas. In this sense, the three well-known systems of Indian philosophy†C<193>rv<193>ka, ç
Jaina and Bauddha dar·anas†are classed as `n<193>stika.'

in Vedic sacrifices. Generally, the model (or archetype) sacrifice ç
which contains all the details, is known as `prak<216>ti' and the ç
derived (or ectype) sacrifice as `vik<216>ti.' For instance, `I<218>u' ç
is a vik<216>ti sacrifice and many of its details are to be adopted ç
by atide·a from its prak<216>ti, the <185>yena.
Atide·a may be provided by `vacana' (Vedic text) or `n<193>ma' (name). ç
When a Vedic text clearly states that the details of the particular ç
sacrifice are to be filled from another already described, the atide·a ç
is by vacana. When two rites have similar names, the details of one ç
have to be derived from the other. For instance, the rite M<193>s<193>gnihotra ç
(prescribed as part of Ku<207><195>ap<193>yin<193>mayana, another ç
rite) and the more common Agnihotra have similar names. Hence those ç
of the details of M<193>s<193>gnihotra which are not mentioned, or, ç
taken for granted, should be adopted by atide·a from the latter. This ç
is atide·a by name.

Sins (p<193>pa) and their expiations (pr<193>ya·citta) have been discussed ç

the pr<193>ya·cittas often recommended, one class is known as `k<216>cchras,' ç
those which can be performed with difficulty and cause a lot of hardship ç
to  the  performer.  (See <MS> K<184>CCHRA<D>  for details.)
Atik<216>cchra is a special expiation of this class. This penance, ç
to be observed for twelve days, is said to purify one of all sins ç
except the ones listed under `mah<193>p<193>takas.'
The person who is observing this penance should eat only one morsel ç
of food for the first three days, that too in the mornings. For the ç
next three days he can eat one morsel in the evenings only. During ç
the next three days he is permitted to eat one morsel, provided it ç
is got without asking for it. For the last three days, he should fast ç
completely.
Some writers like Y<193>j<210>avalkya, allow a handful of food instead ç
of one morsel only.

It is said to be a modification of Agni<218><219>oma. Since it is ç
mentioned in the <184>gveda (7.103.7) it can be inferred as a very ç
ancient sacrifice. The chanting of 29 stotras and 29 ·astras, (the ç
additional ones being recited in the night in four rounds), offering ç
of six oblations in the night, chanting of the long °·vina·astra ç
(comprising 1000 verses) at dawn, sacrificing an ewe to Sarasvat<200> ç
on the day of pressing the soma juice, offering of puro<195><193>·a ç

This can be done either through `k<216>cchra' (penances) or `viparyaya' ç
(reversal), the latter being adopted against diseases brought about ç
by such sins. One of the several such remedies is `Atirudra.'
The eleven stanzas of the Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> (4.5) beginning ç
with the words `namas te rudra manyava' are popularly called Rudr<193>dhy<193>ya ç

Reciting it eleven times is called `Ek<193>da·in<200>.' If the Ek<193>da·in<200> ç
is repeated eleven times, it is called `Laghurudra.' Eleven repetitions ç
of the Laghurudra constitute the `Mah<193>rudra' and eleven Mah<193>rudras, ç
the `Atirudra,' making it 14,641 repetitions of the Rudra. Mah<193>-rudra ç

In all cultured and refined societies, honouring a guest is considered ç
as an important duty of a householder. The Hindu scriptures have extolled ç
a guest as God himself (vide Taittir<200>ya Upani<218>ad 1.11). ç
Out of the five daily sacrifices (pa<210>camah<193>yaj<210>as) a householder ç
is ordained to perform, m<193>nu<218>a-yaj<210>a the fourth one, concerns ç
the feeding and the taking care of guests.
The word `atithi' has been variously defined. The literal meaning ç
is: `one who comes suddenly as a guest without any regard to the ``tithi'' ç
(a day of the lunar calendar).' Sometimes the word is defined as referring ç
to any unknown person who arrives in the evening seeking food and ç
shelter for the night.
The master of the house was expected to meet the guest, welcome him, ç
wash his feet and honour him by giving a seat. Waving a lamp before ç
him, giving food and other things he may need to appease his hunger ç
and thirst, and objects like a bed to rest were also recommended.
Brahmac<193>rins and sa<221>ny<193>sins as also learned br<193>hma<207>as ç
of pure character got precedence over others. Honouring them and feeding ç
them were considered extremely meritorious.
When the guests left, the master of the household was expected to ç
see them off by going part of the way with them.
If heretics and sinners came as guests, they were not be entertained. ç
However, out of human consideration, they could be given uncooked ç
food articles.

@N1 = (`[the Self which is] the essence or the principle of life [or, ç

The phenomena of birth and death have always mystified man. Whether ç
there is `something' before birth and whether it survives death has ç
been an eternal question haunting human minds. Most of the Indian ç
philosophical systems have accep-ted the existence of such a spirit, ç
generally termed `<193>tman,' though views about it have varied greatly.
In the early Vedic literature the word `<193>tman' has rarely been ç
used. Even when used (vide <184>gveda 1.115.1) it does not seem ç
to have any mystical or metaphysical significance as found in the ç
later literature. From a simple notion of cosmic unity, the word gradually ç
came to represent theentity which is both immanent and transcendent ç
with regard to the cosmos.
The term `<193>tman' has been derived and defined in various ways: ç
that which animates; that which pervades; that which experiences; ç
that which exists always. Afuller development of the concept is found ç
in the later Vedic literature such as the°ra<207>yakas and the Upani<218>ads. ç
Here, together with the word `Brahman' it has been used to denote ç
the Cosmic Spirit both in its transcendent and in its immanent aspects. ç
However, gradually, the word `Brahman' came to be used much more to ç
indicate the transcendent Reality whereas the term `<193>tman' was ç
generally confined to the immanent Reality or the individual self.
Descriptions of the nature of the <193>tman or the soul as given by ç
the various schools of Indian philosophy differ widely from one another. ç
The C<193>rv<193>ka (material- istic) schools deny the existence of ç
a permanent soul and attribute consciousness to the chemical reactions ç
brought about by the combination of the pa<210>ca-bh<220>tas or the ç
five fundamental elements constituting the world. Jainism believes ç
in the existence of eternal souls, infinite in number. They possess ç
consciousness which is limited in manifestation but capable of evolving ç
to infinite proportions. Buddhism, while denying the existence of ç
a permanent soul, accepts the continuity of life which generates the ç
next life as one tree produces another through its seed.
The Ny<193>ya system admits of the existence of `<193>tman,' an eternal ç
soul, different from the body, the senses and the mind. It is vibhu ç
or all-pervading and has consciousness, not as integral to it, but ç
as an adventitious attribute brought about by its association with ç
the mind. It is an agent of action and suffers its consequences. Due ç
to mithy<193>-j<210><193>na or false knowledge or ignorance, it allows ç
itself to be swayed by the impulses of r<193>ga (attachment), dve<218>a ç
(dislike) and moha (infatuation). Consequently it performs good or ç
bad actions and suffers their results. It attains apavarga or liberation ç
by tattvaj<210><193>na or right knowledge of the Reality. In this ç
state it is freed from all sorrow, suffering and misery. It is a negative ç
state of transcendence of du<199>kha (pain, suffering) and not a positive ç
state of bliss as some others deem to think. And, the <193>tmans are ç
infinite in number.
The Vai·e<218>ika view is practically identical with that of the Ny<193>ya ç
school.
The S<193><209>khya and the Yoga systems accept the <193>tman as an ç
indubitable reality, which they call as `puru<218>a.' The puru<218>a ç
is eternal, pure and all-pervading consciousness. He gets into the ç
bondage of sa<221>s<193>ra (transmigratory existence) due to aviveka ç
or non-discrimination between himself and prak<216>ti (nature). By ç
viveka-khy<193>ti or knowledge that distinguishes him from the prak<216>ti, ç
the non-self, he recovers his original state of freedom, freedom from ç
pain and suffering. It is not a state of joy or bliss.
These systems also concede that the puru<218>as are innumerable.
The views of the M<200>m<193><221>s<193> school regarding the <193>tman ç
or the soul, are very similar to those of the preceding four systems ç
mentioned here. The <193>tman is an eternal, infinite substance which ç
is related to a real body in a real world. It survives death to be ç
able to reap the consequences of its action performed here. Consciousness ç
is not its essence but only an adventitious quality which arises when ç
some conditions are present. There are as many souls asthere are ç
individuals. Liberation is obtained by the disinterested performance ç
of obligatory actions, knowledge of the <193>tman and the wearing ç
out of the karmas accumulated in the past. Total stoppage of rebirth ç
and remaining in a state beyond pleasure and pain is the special charac- ç
teristic of liberation.
The Ved<193>nta system has branched off into three main schools†Advaita, ç
Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita and Dvaita.
The Advaita school maintains that the <193>tman is eternal, infinite ç
and is of the nature of pure consciousness. It is, inthe ultimate ç
analysis, Brahman the Absolute Itself. Aj<210><193>na or the ignorance ç
of its real nature has led to its bondage and j<210><193>na or knowledge ç
will lead it to liberation. This is not a state to be attained but ç
the original state itself regained. In this state it will enjoy unalloyed ç
bliss.
The Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita school declares that the <193>tman or ç
the soul, though eternal, is not vibhu (infinite) but a<207>u (atomic) ç
in size. Consciousness is intrinsic to it, though its contraction ç
and expansion are possible. Such souls are infinite in number. They ç
are different from Brahman or God, but parts of it. Liberation is ç
attained by bhakti or devotion to God. In this state the souls become ç
similar to God but not absolutely identical with him.
According to the Dvaita school, the soul is eternal, atomic in size ç
and has consciousness as its essence. The souls are innumerable, different ç
from God and from one another too. They are of three classes: those ç
that are bound but may become liberated; those that are eternally ç
confined to transmigratory existence and those that are doomed permanently ç
to the misery of hell. Liberation is obtained by knowledge, devotion ç
to Vi<218><207>u, and by his grace. It is living in Vaiku<207><219>ha, ç
the world of God, in his eternal presence. Even in the state of liberation ç
differences among the liberated souls persist.

The primary purpose of life is to realize this Reality as our true ç

attachment to our body-mind complex. Hence this attachment is to be ç
attenuated and ultimately got rid of by s<193>dhana-catu<218><219>aya ç
or the fourfold discipline. °tm<193>n<193>tma-viveka heads this list. ç
It consists in separation (viveka) of the <193>tman (Self) from all ç

airs, the mind, the intellect, the egoity†none of these is the <193>tman ç

in three different ways depending upon whether we are trying to explain ç
`utpatti' or origination, `v<216>tti' or functioning and `j<210>apti' ç
or know-ledge.
If X is the product of X, then X, the cause could not be present at ç
the instant of time before the one at which X the product came into ç
existence. The principle of causality requires that the cause should ç
precede the product in time. Hence to say that X is the product of ç
the same X is a fallacy.
If X is a function of X, then the cause X must have a larger extension ç
than the function X. But here, being the same thing, the two are coextensive. ç
Hence, to say that X is a function of X (which is identical with the ç
cause X) is a fallacy.
@SPACE1 = 
If X is not different from the knowing of X, then, it would be a product ç
of the constituents of knowing and hence be different from X, which ç
is obviously a fallacy.
In all these cases, that which is sought to be proved, depends upon ç
the very same object, and hence a fallacy.

A small Upani<218>ad belonging to the Atharvaveda with just three ç
sections in prose, it deals with three kinds of `puru<218>as' or beings, ç
called `<193>tm<193>'. The first is the physical body comprising the ç
various limbs and subject to birth and death. It is the `b<193>hy<193>tm<193>' ç
or the outer <193>tman. The second, called `antar<193>tm<193>,' the ç
inner <193>tman, is the mind composed of the s<220>k<218>ma-bh<220>tas ç
or the subtle elements and responsible for the functions of the senses ç
as also the various states like thinking, feeling and willing. The ç
third and the last is the `param<193>tm<193>' or the `puru<218>a,' ç
the Supreme Self or the Person. He is the true Self who is subtler ç
than the subtlest, beyond all change and destruction, the eternally ç
pure witness of all, the infinite, the indestructible.

this °tman-Brahman, the unreal nature of the manifested world and ç

Derived from the word `Atri,' the term `°treya' can refer to anyone ç
who is a descendant of the sage Atri. There are several sages that ç
bear this name. The Aitareya Br<193>hma<207>a (8.22) mentions one ç
sage Udamaya, an °treya, as a priest of the king A<209>ga Vairocana. ç
The B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka Upani<218>ad (2.6.3; 4.6.3) has included ç
the name of one °treya, a disciple of M<193><207><219>i, as one of ç
the teachers of Madhuvidy<193>. In the Mah<193>bh<193>rata we ç
come across an °treya who was a disciple of the sage V<193>madeva. ç
He acted as one of the priests in the Sarpay<193>ga conducted by Janamejaya. ç
It was he who taught spiritual wisdom to Vidura.
°treya Punarvasu is one of the earliest and well-known teachers of ç
°yurveda (science of longevity). He has sometimes been identified ç
with Su·ruta.
°treya R<193>m<193>nuja (<F51320P10MSC1>A. D.<W1> 1220-1295), also known ç
as Ki<195><193>mbi Appu<202><202><193>r, is an important teacher of ç
the Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita school of Ved<193>nta. He imbibed both ç
the Sanskrit and the Tamil traditions of the school and taught them ç
to his nephew, Ved<193>nta De·ika (<MS>A. D.<W1> 1268-1369) another ç
doyen of this school. He was well-versed in the M<200>m<193><221>s<193> ç
as well as the Ved<193>nta systems of philosophy. <F255P255MIC255>Ny<193>yakuli·a, ç

@SPACE = 
@NT = Atri
Atri is a well-known <216><218>i or sage often mentioned in the sacred ç
literature of theHindus. The fifth ma<207><195>ala of the <184>gveda ç
Sa<221>hit<193> mentions Atri and °treyas (descendants of Atri) as ç
the <216><218>is through whom it was revealed. His name occurs in ç
other places also (ibid 10.137.4).
Atri is one of the ten mind-born sons (`m<193>nasaputras') of Brahm<193> ç
the Creator, and classified as a `mahar<218>i' (great sage). Hence ç
he is one of the Praj<193>patis or progenitors of mankind too. He ç
is said to have protected the sun against the eclipse-demon, Svarbh<193>nu, ç
(the R<193>hu of post-Vedic mythology) by composing a `Fourth' prayer, ç
the other three being the usual liturgy of prayers against an eclipse. ç
He is also said to have been the purohita or priest of the pa<210>cajanas ç
(five clans or tribes of the Vedic °ryans). He was tortured by the ç
Asuras (demons) but protected and rescued by the A·vins (the twin ç
deities).
He is listed among the Saptar<218>is or the Seven Sages. Astral myths ç
refer to him as one of the stars of the Saptar<218>ima<207><195>ala ç
or the constellation of the Great Bear.
Atri's wife was Anas<220>y<193> (lit., `one who has no jealousy'), ç
the daughter of Kardama Praj<193>pati. She was the paragon of wifely ç
virtues and chastity. Pleased by the austerities of Atri, Brahm<193>, ç
Vi<218><207>u and <185>iva were born in Anas<220>y<193> as Atri's ç
sons: Candra, Datta or Datt<193>treya and Durv<193>sas.
R<193>ma, while living in the forest Da<207><195>aka, visited his ç
hermitage and learnt about the secrets of dharma (R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, ç
Ara<207>yak<193><207><195>a, 117) from him.
Ancient writers on dharma·<193>stras have held Atri in high esteem. ç
Manusm<216>ti (3.16) and Mah<193>bh<193>rata (Anu·<193>sanaparva ç
65.1) have quoted his views. There is an °treya Dharma·<193>stra ç
attributed to him. It is in nine chapters and treats of d<193>na (gifts), ç
japya (prayers) and tapas (austerities).
There are several other works styled `Atri Sm<216>ti' or `Atri Sa<221>hit<193>' ç
in manuscripts. One Atri Sa<221>hit<193> now available in print, ç
contains 400 verses and deals with most of the topics generally dealt ç
with in the dharma·<193>stras.

Sa<221>ny<193>sa or monastic life is the last of the four <193>·ramas ç
or stages of life through which every dvija (`the twice-born') has ç
to pass. Generally every pious dvija entertains the desire of dying ç
as a sa<221>ny<193>sin, since that enhances his chance of mok<218>a ç
or liberation which is the ultimate goal of human life.
Life being uncertain, situations may so arise in life that a man may ç
die without taking sa<221>ny<193>sa. For such persons afflic-ted with ç
mortal diseases or facing grave dangers, the dharma·<193>stras have ç
provided an emergency ritual by which they can take sa<221>ny<193>sa ç
and hence die as sa<221>ny<193>sins. This is called `<193>tura-sa<221>ny<193>sa.'
The essentials of this ritual are: sa<209>kalpa (resolve to take sa<221>ny<193>sa), ç
k<218>aura (tonsure of the head), s<193>vitr<200>-prave·a (merging ç
the G<193>yatr<200> mantra into pra<207>ava or Om) and prai<218>occ<193>ra ç
(uttering the prai<218>amantra, signifying renunciation).
Even among these, the first and the last are enough if there is no ç
scope for performing the other aspects of the ritual.
If by chance, a person who has taken <193>turasa<221>ny<193>sa survives ç
the ordeal, he is expected to take regular sa<221>ny<193>sa with all ç
the formalities. He cannot go back to the old way of life.

he lived upon the grains picked up from the agricultural fields, (ka<207>a ç
= grain, ad= to eat) he came to be known as `Ka<207><193>da.' It ç
is said that he performed severe austerities to get the grace of <185>iva. ç
Pleased with his devotion and faith, <185>iva appeared before him ç
in the form of an `ul<220>ka' (an owl) and taught him this philosophy. ç
Hence Ka<207><193>da's Vai·e<218>ika Dar·ana is also known as `Aul<220>kya-dar·ana,' ç

Among the sa<221>sk<193>ras or sacraments enumerated by the ancient ç
writers on thedharma·<193>stras, like Gautama, four vedavratas are ç
important (vide Gautama Dharmas<220>tras 8.15). They are: mah<193>-n<193>mn<200>-vrata, ç
mah<193>-vrata, upani<218>ad-vrata (or aupa-ni<218>ada-vrata) and ç
god<193>na-vrata. Each of these vratas had to be observed by the brahmac<193>rin ç
(celibate student of the Vedas) for a year each.
Other works like the <185><193><209>kh<193>yana G<216>hyas<220>tras ç
(2.11-12) describe these four vratas as ·ukriya, ·<193>kvara, vr<193>tika ç
and aupani<218>ada. They are the vratas that precede the study of ç
the different sections of the Vedas.
The aupani<218>ada-vrata precedes the study of the Upani<218>ad part ç
of the Vedas.
At the beginning of each of these vratas there has to be a separate ç
upa-nayana ceremony involving the wearing of the new yaj<210>opav<200>ta ç
(sacred thread), new deer-skin and new girdle. The vrata lasts for ç
one year.
Failure to observe these vratas or lapses during their performance ç
had to be expiated with appropriate pr<193>ya·cittas specially prescribed. ç
The observance of these vratas seems to have been gradually given ç

@NT = Aurobindo
Sri Aurobindo (1872<192>1950) is one of the bright stars of the modern ç
Indian firmament who has left behind him a legacy, a philosophy and ç
an institution. Born on the 15th August 1872 as the last son of Dr. ç
Krishna Dhan Ghosh and Swarnalata Devi at Konnagar of West Bengal, ç
he had his early education at the Loretto Convent School of Darjeeling. ç
After two years, in 1879, he was taken, along with his two elder brothers, ç
to England for further education. He lived there for 14 years, his ç
early coaching being under Mr. and Mrs. Drewett. He had his higher ç
education at the St. Paul's School of London and King's College at ç
Cambridge. He became an adept not only in English but also in the ç
classical European languages like Greek and Latin, as also French, ç
Italian and German. Though he passed the open competition for the ç
Indian Civil Service (I.<|>C.<|>S.) in 1890, he failed to complete it ç
since he felt no call for it. During this period he had already become ç
well acquainted with the political upheaval in India as also the atrocities ç
of the alien British government on the Indians.
Returning to India in 1893 he accep-ted service under the Maharaja ç
of Baroda in which he continued till 1906, one year after the partition ç
of Bengal. All along he had kept in touch with the political movement ç
and had proved to be a source of inspiration for the young revolution- ç
aries. His writings in the papers like the Jugantar, Induprak<193>·a ç
and Bande M<193>taram being of a highly provocative nature, attracted ç
the evil eye of the British government. His call for boycotting the ç
foreign goods, substituting national schools for the government institutions, ç
creation of arbitration courts for people and attempts at forming ç
the nucleus of a national army added to his problems with the government. ç
He was finally arrested in 1908 in what is now well-known as the M<193><207>iktala ç
Bomb Case and was in jail for a year, before being acquitted.
Right from 1904 he had been taking deep interest in the practice of ç
yoga. In 1908 he received some help and guidance from Sri Lele, a ç
Mahratta Yogi. While in jail, he has stated, that he had some mystic ç
experiences like hearing the voice of Vivekananda instructing him ç
on some aspects of yoga.
@SPACE1 = 
He started two weeklies, Karmayogin (in English) and Dharma (in ç
Bengali) which had a fairly large circulation. Meanwhile his association ç
with politics including the Indian National Congress continued. However, ç
a strong inner urge made him take a sudden decision to depart for ç
Chandernagore, a French settlement, leaving the editing of the Karmayogin ç
in the hands of Sister Nivedita, with whom he had a very close acquaintance. ç
He later shifted to Pondicherry in 1910 where he lived till he breathed ç
his last, on the 5th December, 1950.
@SPACE = 
In Pondicherry he totally dedicated himself to yogas<193>dhan<193> ç
and guiding the earnest souls that started gathering round him. Thus, ç
in course of time, an Ashrama grew around him. Mrs. Mira Richards, ç
a French admirer, later known as the Mother, who had come into contact ç
with him in 1914, started living there and took over the management ç
of the Ashrama by 1922.

Sri Aurobindo was a prolific writer too. S<193>vitr<200>, a long ç
poem of 24,000 lines in blank verse, is his magnum opus. He has ç
delineated his philosophy in another great work, The Life Divine. ç
Essays on the G<200>t<193>, The Synthesis of Yoga and The Secret ç
of the Vedas are some of his other notable works.
@SPACE = 
His teaching is that behind the appearances of the universe, there ç
is the Reality of a Being and Consciousness, the Self of all beings ç
and things. This Being is involved here in matter. Evolution is the ç
method by which it liberates itself. Life is the first step of this ç
release of consciousness. Mind is the second. The next step of evolution ç
must be towards the development of Supermind and Spirit as the dominant ç
power in the conscious being. Man has to exert himself consciously ç
to evolve to this level. The ancient psychological discipline and ç
practice of yoga is the method. This will help the descent of the ç
higher, supernatural, principle into the mind. Then the One Self is ç
discovered in all and the supramental consciousness transforms and ç
divinises thehuman nature.

Son of the sage Cyavana (a descendant of Bh<216>gu) and °ru<218>i ç

to the race of K<193>rtav<200>ry<193>rjuna were harassing the <216><218>is ç
who were descendants of Bh<216>gu, including the womenfolk. As a result ç
of the tension and fear, the foetus in the womb of °ru<218>i slipped ç
into her thigh and was born out of it. The child†<216><218>i Aurva ç
†stared at the marauders making them blind. They regained their sight ç
by praying to the child-sage.
Later on, the sage Aurva engaged himself in a sacrifice aimed at destroying ç
the followers of K<193>rtav<200>ry<193>rjuna. He was however dissuaded ç
from doing so. In the process Aurva discharged his anger intothe ç
sea, in the form of a horse. This submarine fire came to be known ç
as `Va<195>av<193>gni.'

Starting from the Vedic times, the importance of the body in our life, ç
whether secular or sacred, has been duly recognised. It is only a ç
strong and healthy body that can serve our purpose best. This naturally ç
led to the development of °yurveda (life-science or health-science).
Treatment of diseases and improving the general stamina form a salient ç
aspect of °yurveda. Medicines or drugs used for such treatment have ç
been given the general name, `au<218>adha.' Derived from the word ç
`o<218>adhi' (plant, herb), it means a `preparation made of plants ç
and herbs.' However in practice, it refers to all medicines whether ç
derived out of herbs, animal products or minerals.
°yurveda has developed its own methods of pharmacy. It aims at retaining ç
the medical properties of the ingredients of drugs with the necessary ç
modification brought about by dilution, heating, emulsi-fication, ç
clarification, impregnation and other means.
The au<218>adhas are generally compounded with bases like gh<216>ta ç
(ghee), taila (oil), water and milk. They may be administered as ka<218><193>ya ç
(decoction) gu<219>ik<193> (pills), modaka (uncooked pills), c<220>r<207>a ç

the antelope skin and yoktra (cord of mu<210>ja grass worn by the ç
wife). The utensils are smeared with the soma juice before disposal. ç

A special s<193>man called avabh<216>tha-s<193>man, is chanted during ç

@NT = avaccheda-v<193>da
@N1 = (`theory of limitation')
According to the Advaita Ved<193>nta Brahman, the Absolute is one, ç
without a second. The j<200>vas or the individual souls, though apparently ç
limited and many, are Brahman itself, in the ultimate analysis. How ç
the One becomes or appears as the many is metaphysically indefinable. ç
But it is, however, describable figuratively or analogically. The ç
two well-known theories that have successfully attempted this are: ç
bimba-pratibimba-v<193>da, also called pratibimba-v<193>da (`theory ç
of reflection') and avacchedav<193>da (`theory of limitation').
According to the former theory, m<193>y<193> and avidy<193> act like ç
reflecting media. When Brahman is reflected in m<193>y<193>, it becomes ç
®·vara; when reflected in avidy<193>, it becomes the j<200>vas. Though ç
the reflected images (called `pratibimba') are affected by the media, ç
the original (called `bimba') is not. Also, when one reflected image ç
is affected by the changes in the particular medium, other reflections ç
may not be so affected. This explains the different condi-tions of ç
the different j<200>vas though all the j<200>vas are reflections ç
of the same Brahman. When the reflecting media are done away
