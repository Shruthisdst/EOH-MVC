@N1 = (the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet)
Being the first manifest sound that emerged out of the <195>amaru ç
(miniature drum) of Lord <185>iva during his famous dance (t<193><207><195>avan<216>tya), ç
it is the first letter of the Sanskrit alphabet and the fundamental ç
sound without which no other letter can bepronounced. Hence it is ç
identified with God himself or used as his symbol. The Sanskrit lexicons ç
give as many as 31 meanings and it is used in six different ways in ç
grammar.
@NT = ab<193>dhita
@N1 = (`not contradicted')
In Indian philosophical systems, the word b<193>dha and its derivatives ç
are often used as technical terms, in the sense of objection or contradiction. ç
Hence `ab<193>dhita' means that which is not contradicted, `a' representing ç
the negative particle. For instance, truth or reality is defined as ç
that which is ab<193>dhita, never contradicted. Obviously what is ç
contradicted can never be considered true or real in the ultimate ç
sense.
@NT = abha<209>gas
Lyrical poems, the compositions of the mystics of Maharashtra, are ç
popularly known as `abha<209>gas.' `Abha<209>ga' literally means `unbroken ç
or indivisible.' The story goes that when Sant Tuk<193>r<193>m, one ç
of thegreatest saints of Maharashtra, was compelled by his detractors ç
to consign his poetical works to the river Indr<193>ya<207><200>, ç
LordVi<219><219>hala (Vi<218><207>u) restored them to their author ç
saying that the works were `abha<209>ga' (`indestructible'). That ç
apart, it is true that these poems and songs abound in philosophical, ç
mystical and ethical teachings which are `abha<209>ga' and hence true ç
for all time. Besides Tuk<193>r<193>m, several other saints like J<210><193>ne·var, ç
N<193>mdev, Ekn<193>th and R<193>md<193>s, including women saints ç
like Jan<193>b<193>i and K<193>nhop<193>tr<193> havecomposed these ç
abha<209>gas. Importance of the divine name and its repetition in ç
spiritual life, God-realisation as the summum bonum of life, the ç
necessity of acquiring guru's grace, the harmony of worldly life and ç
spiritual life, the need for inculcating moral values in day-to-day ç
life are some of the oft-recurring themes of these compositions. If ç
making the abstract spiritual truths intelligible and practicable ç
to the common masses is the measure of success of religious reform ç
movements, the Bhakti Movement of thesaints of Maharashtra through ç
their abha<209>gas has succeeded admirably. Even today these abha<209>gas ç
are sung by the common folk.
@NT = <193>bh<193>sa
@N1 = (`appearance')
Literally the word means a `reflection,' an `appearance,' hence, a ç
false phenomenon which shows itself as the real. For instance, the ç
reflection of an object in a mirror is an `<193>bh<193>sa.' The word ç
is widely used in Advaita Ved<193>nta in the context of the relationship ç
between the j<200>va (individual self) and Brahman (the Supreme Self). ç
The j<200>va according to one of the schools of Advaita Ved<193>nta, ç
is only an `<193>bh<193>sa' of Brahman in and through the medium of ç
the anta<199>kara<207>a (mind).
In Hindu logic, the word is used with regard to hetu or cause. Owing ç
to several factors, a real hetu can get obscured and a false hetu, ç
hetv<193>bh<193>sa, can appear in its place leading to wrong conclusions. ç
For more details see <MS>HETV°BH°SA.<D>
In temple architecture, the word stands for a particular type of vim<193>na ç
(tower over the sanctum sanctorum).
@NT = abh<193>va
@N1 = (`non-existence')
The production of an effect is the sign of the existence of the cause. ç
In the same way, the non-production of it is the sign of its non-existence. ç
This is the line of argument adopted by the Vai·e<218>ika system, ç
one of the two dialectical schools of Hindu philosophy. According ç
to it, the non-perception of a jar in the ground before us is the ç
same as the perception of the non-existence, abh<193>va, of the jar. ç
This is the only system which considers abh<193>va as a fundamental ç
category of reality and describes four kinds of it: 1) pr<193>gabh<193>va<192> ç
non-existence before coming into being, as for e.g., the non-existence ç
of the jar before it <|>is <|>produced; <|>2) pradhva<221>s<193>bh<193>va<192> ç
non-existence after destruction, as for e.g., the non-existence of ç
the jar after it is destroyed; 3)anyony<193>bh<193>va<192>mutual ç
non-existence of two different objects, as for e.g., the non-existence ç
of the cow in<|>the<|>horse<|>and vice versa; and 4) atyant<193>- bh<193>va<192>absolute ç
non-existence, as for e.g., the non-existence of colour in air.
@NT = abh<193>va-yoga
@N1 = (`yoga of negation')
Some  of  the  <185>aiva  schools  of philosophy describe yoga as ç
being of five kinds, one of which is abh<193>va-yoga. In this state, ç
the fourth yogic plane to be ascended, the yogi transcends the world ç
appearance in its various forms. He is not concerned with the world. ç
To him, the world has practically disappeared. Hence the name abh<193>va-yoga, ç
the mystic experi-ence (yoga) in which the world has been negated ç
(abh<193>va).

@N1 = (`hand<R>ç
[pose indicating] protection from fear')
The icons of gods and goddesses of the Hindu pantheon, whether they ç
are of the aspects of the Supreme or of the minor deities presiding ç
over various powers ofthe cosmos, often display this pose. Usually ç
the right hand is shown raised, exhibiting the palm and with the fingers ç
extended.  It  symbolises  assurance  of protection from fear and ç
danger. It is but natural for mankind, with its fear of the unknown, ç
to seek protection from the Divine and to believe in an appropriate ç
response from It.

@NT = abhic<193>ra, abhic<193>rakarma
@N1 = (`black magic,' `exorcism,' `exorcistical act')
In the eternal quest for happiness, peace and pleasure, man is often ç
compelled to counteract the various forces and powers that thwart ç
this quest. When common or natural remedies available to him fail ç
to bring the desired result, he naturally turns towards uncommon and ç
supernatural remedies. Attempts at enlisting the help of the supernatural, ç
be it a fierce deity, a ghost or a disembodied spirit, are a common ç
feature of all cultures. Hinduism seems to be no exception to this. ç
The rites of abhic<193>ra, though occasionally mentioned in the <184>gveda, ç
are found in abundance in the last of the Vedas, the Atharvaveda ç
as also the subsidiary works based on it likethe °<209>girasa Kalpas<220>tras ç
and the Kau·ika Kalpas<220>tras. These rites pertain to a wide variety ç
of subjects ranging from curing serious ailments, inflicting injury ç
on enemies and rivals, winning the love of the beloved, to securing ç
long life and prosperity. For instance, if a woman ties a particular ç
root on her body with appropriate mantras, the mind of her husband ç
is attracted only towards her and not towards her co-wives. A person ç
harassed by enemies can perform certain rites by which spirits called ç
k<216>ty<193>s will come to his help in overcoming them. Persons suffering  from  incurable  diseases  are ç
advised to wear certain amulets like m<220>lama<207>i, duly consecrated.

@NT = <193>bhic<193>rika-m<220>rti
@N1 = (`image pertaining to abhic<193>ra')
According to Hindu iconography certain categories of the images of ç
Vi<218><207>u whose installation and consecration help in black magical ç
rites for the destruction of enemies, are classed under the <193>bhic<193>rika ç
type. These images, whether in the standing, sitting or lying posture, ç
are bereft of beauty or symmetry. Emaciated body, dark complexion, ç
dark clothes and a shrunken countenance with the eyesturned upwards ç
characterise such images. They are, as a rule, established in the ç
outermost periphery of the village or town, known as the `pai·<193>capada' ç
(the place where goblins live), in inaccessible places like mountain ç
tops or thick jungles. Installation  is  done  at  inauspicious moments ç
and worship conducted through magical formulae and sorcery.

@NT = abhihit<193>nvaya-v<193>da
@N1 = (`theory of words in relation')
The dar·anas or Indian philosophical systems were very particular ç
in working out their own theories about the meanings of words and ç
sentences, because, upon these depended the development of theirarguments ç
to establish their schools vis-a-vis other schools.
A word may have a direct meaning as also an implied meaning. When ç
such words are put together to form a sentence, the total effect may ç
be something more than the meanings indicated by the individual words. ç
Different schools differ as regards the details.
The above theory is propounded by the Ny<193>ya school and accepted ç
by Kum<193>rila Bha<219><219>a (7th cent. <F51320P10MSC1>A.<|>D.<F255P255DC255>)<F51320P10W1C1> ç
of the M<200>m<193><221>s<193> school. According to this, the words ç
forming a sentence, can have independent meanings also in addition ç
to contributing to the total sense of the sentence. For instance, ç
in the sentence `g<193>m <193>naya,' `Bring the cow', the word `g<193>m' ç
is a noun in the accusative case and refers to a cow, an animal of ç
the bovine class. The word `<193>naya' is a verb in the imperative ç
mood denoting the action of bringing. When related in a sentence thus, ç
they give the total meaning that the person to whom they are addressed, ç
is expected to bring the animal cow. However they do not lose their ç
individual significance. The words when used independently continue ç
to denote the animal cow and the act of bringing.
This theory is not acceptable to Prabh<193>kara Bha<219><219>a (a ç
disciple of Kum<193>-rila), another teacher of M<200>m<193><221>s<193>, ç
forming a parallel school. According to him, words have no independent ç
denotation and can denote something only when used in injunctive sentences ç
(`vidhi') in relation to other words. His theory is known as `anvit<193>bhidh<193>na-v<193>da.'
@NT = abhijit
@N1 = (`victorious')
Sins of omission and commission, when not intentional, can be atoned ç
by certain expiatory rites known as pr<193>ya·citta. Abhijit is one ç
of such rites. It is actually a minor Vedic sacrifice similar in structure ç
to the major sacrifice Soma, but requiring<|> just <|>a<|> day to perform. ç
It is specially recommended as an expiation for the sin of killing ç
a br<193>hma<207>a.
Abhijit is also the name of a nak<218>atra (star or asterism) counted ç
as the 28th, after uttar<193><218><193><195>ha. In mythological works, ç
Abhijit is described as a daughter of Dak<218>a-Brahm<193> and as ç
a wife of Candra (the moon).
The auspicious period that occurs at midnight is also called abhijit. ç
Lord K<216><218><207>a is said to have been born at that time.
@NT = Abhimanyu
One of the greatest warriors of the second generation in the Mah<193>bh<193>rata ç
and a legendary figure, Abhimanyu was the son of Arjuna and Subhadr<193>, ç
and the husband of Uttar<193>. Trained in the martial arts by his ç
father Arjuna and uncle <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a, he matured ç
into a great warrior at an early age. During the Mah<193>bh<193>rata ç
war, in the absence of <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a and Arjuna, Abhimanyu ç
was obliged to break through the cakravy<220>ha, the wheel-formation ç
of the Kaurava army. Though he fought valiantly, he was surrounded ç
by a multitude of Kaurava warriors and killed as he was ignorant of ç
the technique of extricating himself out of that cakravy<220>ha.
However, before laying down his life, he fought bravely against the ç
greatest of the warriors on the Kaurava side and displayed remarkable ç
heroism.

@NT = Abhinavagupta
If what is known as `Pratyabhij<210><193>-dar·ana' (Kashmir <185>aivism) ç
has attained a respectable status among the medieval philosophical ç
systems, it is mainly due to Abhinavagupta, the encyclopaedic scholar ç
and prolific writer of the middle ages. His ancestors hailed from ç
the `Antarved<200>,' the country between the Ga<209>g<193> and the ç
Yamun<193> rivers. He lived in Kashmir. Hisliterary activities extended ç
from about <F51320P10MSC1>A.D.<W1> 980 to <MS>A. D.<W1> 1020. He was an ç
authority on several subjects and at least forty works are attributed ç
to him.
His  Tantras<193>ra  is  a  voluminous treatise  on  Tantra.  ®·vara-pratyabhij<210><193>-vimar·in<200> ç
is an authoritative work on the monistic <185>aivism of the Pratyabhij<210><193> ç
school of Kashmir. Among his other works Tantr<193>loka and Param<193>rthas<193>ra ç
should also be mentioned.
Abhinavagupta has carved out a niche for himself in the fields of ç
poetics and dramaturgy also. His two superb commentaries, Dhvany<193>loka-locana ç
(also called Locana) and Abhinavabh<193>rat<200> on °nanda-vardhana's ç
Dhvany<193>loka and Bharata's N<193><219>ya·<193>stra are considered ç

@NT = abhinive·a
@N1 = (`excessive attachment [to<R>ç

All living beings, starting from an insignificant worm right up to ç
the highly evolved man, have a natural fear of death and a strong ç
desire to live. According to the Yoga system of Pata<210>jali, though ç
this is understandable, it is not desirable! It is not desirable because ç
it is born out of avidy<193> or ignorance of the true nature of the ç
soul which is really immortal. This very ignorance is a great stumbling ç
block on the path to perfection. Hence abhinive·a which is technically ç
termed as a kle·a, an affliction or a vicious tendency, preventing ç
the rise of true knowledge, must be cast off by the seeker of perfection. ç
Spiritual practices like kriy<193>yoga will help the seeker in this ç
task.

@NT = Abhiplava
The <216><218>is (men of knowledge and wisdom), who were the spiritual ç
leaders of the Hindu society, kept before it the supreme ideal of ç
mok<218>a, liberation from the transmigratory existence. However, ç
they never forgot that man has a constitutional inclination towards ç
the enjoyment of pleasures got through artha (wealth) and k<193>ma ç
(desires of the flesh). While recognising this, they also stressed ç
the need to confine them within limits through dharma (righteousness), ç
and instituted the system of yaj<210>a or sacrifice through which ç
man could achieve the desired ends. Abhiplava is one of the sacrifices ç
included under the Soma group of sacrifices andforms part of a bigger ç
one called Gav<193>mayana. It is spread over six days and includes ç
four ukthyas (a small Soma sacrifice) and two Agni<218><219>omas (another ç
Soma sacrifice with hymns of praise on Agni, the fire-god) and the ç
singing of some S<193>ma hymns.
@NT = <193>bh<200>ras
Caste has always been a dominant feature in the Hindu society. Division ç
into groups based on vocation is a phenomenon common to all societies. ç
But in India, such groups have often become fossilized and mutually ç
exclusive, the membership of the group being acquired only by birth. ç
Hence the appellation `j<193>ti' (= birth). In spite of the vigorous ç
attempts of its leaders to make the particular j<193>ti a water-tight ç
compartment, thanks to human nature, mixing has always taken place ç
throughout history, giving rise to more castes, born out of the admixture ç
of the prevalent ones. The <193>bh<200>ras constitute such a mixed ç
caste. They are regarded by Manu as the offspring of a br<193>hma<207>a ç
by an a<221>ba<218><219>ha (descended from a br<193>hma<207>a father ç
and vai·ya mother) woman. Whether the <193>bh<200>ras were a nomadic ç
tribe which migrated into India by stages or were natives of this ç
land, it is certain they lived a nomadic and predatory life. By the ç
2nd cent. <F51320P10MSC1>A. D.<W1> some of them had attained high ranks ç
and had evensiezed political power, wielding it effectively till ç
the 4th cent. <MS>A. D.<W1> Mention may be made of °bh<200>ra ®·varasena, ç
son of <185>ivadatta, supposed to be the founder of the Kalacuri-Cedi ç
era (3rd cent. <MS>A. D.<W1>) whorose to the royal rank in northern ç
Maharashtra.
The common people among them lived by dairy farming. They have contributed ç
much to the development of Indian music. The Apabhra<221>·a dialect, ç
a form of Pr<193>k<216>t,is also their contribution. But their greatest ç
contribution is towards the growth of pastoral legends centring round ç
<185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a. The modern <193>h<200>rs are considered ç
to be the descendants of <193>bh<200>ras and are scattered over the ç
greater part of India.
@NT = abhi<218>ava
@N1 = (`to press out')
This is a technical term used in Vedic liturgy to indicate the extracting ç
of the soma juice from the soma stalks, by pressing them. There are ç
two kinds of pressing: k<218>ullak<193>bhi<218>ava (the little pressing) ç
and mah<193>bhi<218>ava (the great pressing). In the k<218>ullak<193>bhi<218>ava, ç
the Adhvaryu (oneof the principal priests who does most of the ritual ç
acts and recites the mantras from the Yajurveda) places a few soma ç
stalks on one of the lower grinding stones (called upara), pours consecrated ç
water (called nigr<193>bhya) and beats the stalks in three turns consisting ç
respectively of 8, 11 and 12 single beatings. The juice extracted ç
is collected in a cup. In the mah<193>bhi<218>ava, four priests sitting ç
round the hide that holds the pressing stones (called adhi<218>ava<207>acarman) ç
beat the stalks in three turns, after sprinkling them with consecrated ç
water, using the crushing stones (called gr<193>van) for the operation. ç
Thewhole act is a ceremonial ritual, forming part of Soma sacrifices.
Abhi<218>ava is also the technical name given to the ceremonial bath ç
taken before religious rites, especially sacrifices.

elaborate and expensive ceremony of royal consecration. Abhi<218>ecan<200>ya ç
is the principal rite in the whole ceremony. The name is derived from ç
`abhi<218>eka' (sprinkling with holy water) which forms the most important ç
part of the ritual. The Abhi<218>ecan<200>ya rite which comes under ç
the Soma group of sacrifices, is spread over five days, consisting ç
of one d<200>k<218><193> (taking the vows), three upasad (a group ç
of rites in which ghee is offered to Agni), and one suty<193> (pressing ç
of the soma stalks) days. The D<200>k<218><193> lasts for a year. ç
In the actual unction rite, the water drawn from various sources and ç
places is kept in wooden vessels and sprinkled over the king by several ç

@NT = abhi·rava<207>a
@N1 = (`to face and to cause to listen')
Performance of religious and semi- religious rites to propitiate one's ç
ancestors is part and parcel of many cultures in the world. The Hindus ç
do it through ·r<193>ddha (death anniversary rites of departed ancestors), ç
though its forms may vary from caste to caste. Inviting and feeding ç
the br<193>hma<207>as of learning and character is not only obligatory ç
but also considered highly meritorious since the spirits of the departed ç
souls are believed to be satisfied with it. When these br<193>hma<207>as ç
are partaking of the food, the performer of the ·r<193>ddha or his ç
representative is expected to stand respectfully in front of them ç
(abhi) and chant certain Vedic and paur<193><207>ic hymns prescribed ç
as suitable for such occasions, in their hearing (·rava<207>a). Theidea ç
is that this helps in creating a spiritual atmosphere soaked in which ç
the br<193>hma<207>as eat the food and consequently the forefathers ç
will feel immensely satisfied and happy.
Some of the hymns recommended by the dharma·<193>stras to be chanted ç
during abhi·rava<207>a are:
G<193>yatr<200> (<184>gveda Sa<221>hit<193> 3.62.10), Rak<218>oghna ç
Mantras (<184>gveda Sa<221>hit<193> 4.4.1-5), Pitrya Mantras (Taittir<200>ya ç

38 to 40).
While chanting the hymns, the sacred thread should be worn in the ç

arm-pit). The chanting should be neither too loud nor too fast.

@NT = abhiv<193>dana
@N1 = (`[causing the benediction to be]  pronounced  [by  the  elders  while ç

Honouring one's superiors is a basic dogma in Hindu religion and culture. ç
As long as it was scrupulously followed, it contributed to the solidarity ç
of the society. In the presence of a person worthy of honour, one ç
is expected to rise from one's seat and salute him. The former is ç
called pratyut-th<193>na and the latter abhiv<193>dana. After facing ç
(<MJ4>=<DJ0><|>abhi) him, introducing himself and bowing down to him, ç
the superior is expected to pronounce benediction (v<193>dana). Hence ç
the term. While offering abhiv<193>dana, it is necessary to repeat ç
one's gotra (parental lineage) along with the name of the particular ç
branch of the Veda traditionally studied in the family, and one's ç
own name. During this repetition he should touch his ears and bend ç
his head down. After this he can bow down touching or not touching ç
the feet of the superior. In upasa<209>graha<207>a, another variety ç
of abhiv<193>dana, clasping the feet of the superior at the time of ç
saluting is obligatory.
Elaborate details have been given in the dharma·<193>stras with regard ç
to abhi-v<193>dana. For instance, it can be nitya (obligatory every ç
day), naimittika (occasio-nal) or k<193>mya (done with certain rewards ç
in view). Bowing down to one's teacher and parents everyday comes ç
under the first category. Saluting the elders on special occasions ç
like after returning from a journey, belongs to the second. If done ç
at one's own will, seeking knowledge or long life or bliss in heaven ç
it is classed under the third. Detailed rules have also been given ç
as to whom abhiv<193>dana can be offered or should not be offered, ç
the rules being based on caste, learning, status in society and age. ç
It is noteworthy that salutation to women, except to one's mother, ç
should be offered without touching their feet.
The persons to whom abhiv<193>dana is offered should return it in ç
a manner proper to their position and status.

@N1 =  (`practice leading to yoga')
Controlling the vagaries of the mind and concentrating it on a chosen ç
object or theme is a formidable task. Only those who have attempted ç
it can vouch for its near impossibility. However, the great teachers ç
of yoga assure us that it is not impossible, though difficult. With ç
the right attitude and determined practice, this becomes possible. ç
The path prescribed is abhy<193>sayoga. This term which seems to be ç
the creation of the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (8.8 and 12.9), a highly ç
venerated scripture of Hinduism, has been interpreted in two slightly ç
different but compatible ways: (a)abhy<193>sa or practice leading ç
to yoga or concentration; (b) abhy<193>sa or practice which is itself ç
yoga since it leads to yoga or concentration. Withdrawing the mind ç
repeatedly from the various objects towards which it is naturally ç
drawn and fixing it upon the desired goal is abhy<193>sa. When this ç
fixing becomes steady and grows in intensity, it ripens into yoga ç
orperfect concentration, also called sam<193>dhi. Hence abhy<193>sa ç
and yoga form the preliminary and final stages of the same discipline. ç
Retiring into solitude, choosing the right place conducive to yoga, ç
observing moderation in all aspects of daily life, practising self-control<192>these ç
are some ofthe disciplines recommended by the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> ç
for abhy<193>sayoga (vide 6.10-28).
@NT = abhyudaya
@N1 = (`prosperity')
The Hindu scriptures, especially the dharma·<193>stras, have always ç
emphasised that a householder must strive for abhyu-daya (worldly ç
prosperity) but not forgetting that ni··reyasa (mok<218>a or liberation) ç
is the ultimate goal of life. For a man of the world, it is certainly ç
not wrong to entertain modest ambitions with regard to wealth, power, ç
progeny or fame, to keep himself and his family happy and contented. ç
On the other hand, he will be failing in his duty if he neglects his ç
family and makes his dependents suffer. However, it is equally emphasised ç
that while striving for abhyudaya, he should never forsake dharma ç
(righteousness).

Belief in the continued existence of the forefathers (pit<216>s) in ç
a subtle body at a different plane (pit<216>loka or the world of manes) ç
is a common feature of mankind in general and the Hindus in particular. ç
It is often believed that these <M>f<D>orefathers when propitiated ç
through appropriate rites can bestow on their descendants worldly ç
prosperity, nay, even spiritual benefits. The propitiating rite is ç
called ·r<193>ddha, since it is offered with ·raddh<193> (faith). ç
Ofthe several ·r<193>ddhas, <193>bhyudayika-·r<193>ddha is particularly ç
connected with abhyudaya (worldly well-being) and is performed on ç
auspicious occasions like the birth of children, their marriage and ç
so on. It can even be performed at the commencement of a charitable ç
act such as the dedication of a well or tank or park to the public.
Unlike the other ·r<193>ddhas which are solemn, this ·r<193>ddha is ç
a joyous occasion. Hence certain changes have been effected in its ç
performance. For instance: It is done in the morning and not in the ç
afternoon. The yaj<210>opav<200>ta (sacred cord) is worn in the usual ç
way and not from right to left. The mantra `svadh<193>,' which is ç
a must in other ·r<193>ddhas is not used. Yava grains (barley) are ç
used as the oblatory material instead of sesamum.
This ·r<193>ddha is sometimes identified with N<193>nd<200>·r<193>ddha ç
or V<216>ddhi·r<193>ddha.

@NT = Abu, Mt.
Any spot of serenity and natural beauty can be made into either a ç
place of picnic or pilgrimage. The choice depends upon the temperament. ç
To the Hindu mind such spots reflect God's beauty and offer a congenial ç
atmosphere for contemplation upon Him. One of such spots that nature ç
has been bountiful in bestowing upon India is Mount Abu situated in ç
southern Rajasthan and at a distance of 170 kms., (110 miles) from ç
city of Ahmedabad. It is part of the Ar<193>val<200> range of mountains. ç
The summit called Guru·ikhara rises to a height of 1700 metres (5610 ç
ft.) above the mean sea level. Referred to as Arbuda in the Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
it is extolled as a t<200>rthak<218>etra (a place of pilgrimage) on ç
account of its association with the great sage Vasi<218><219>ha whose ç
<193>·rama or hermitage was situated here. This is also supposed to ç
be the place of origin of the Agnikula-k<218>attriyas of Rajasthan ç
like the Cauvh<193>ns, Sola<209>kis and Parm<193>rs. Among the Hindu ç
religious sites, the chief one is the Guru-·ikhara itself, containing ç
in a cavern the `footprints' of an ancient sage. The Acale·vara temple ç
campus has a cleft in the rock containing `<185>iva's toenail.' The ç
same campus contains a shrine for Arbuda M<193>t<193>, the consort ç
of <185>iva and the Mother-goddess of the hill. There are also shrines ç
for the sages Vasi<218><219>ha and Gautama at Gomukha. The temples ç
at Dev<193><209>ga<207>a are dedicated to Vi<218><207>u and Narasi<221>ha. ç
Mount Abu is also famous for its Jain temples built in marble by the ç
merchant prince Vimal·<193> (<F51320MS>A. D.<W1> 1032) and the brothers ç
Tejp<193>l and Vastup<193>l (<MS>A.<|>D.<W1> 1197<192>1247). These ç
temples are dedicated to <184><218>abha-deva and P<193>r·van<193>tha, ç

@NT = acalali<209>ga
@N1 = (`the immovable li<209>ga')
<185>iva, the third deity of the Hindu Trinity responsible for the ç
dissolution of this universe is worshipped both in the anthropomorphic ç
aspect and as the li<209>ga. The latter however is the rule, the former ç
being an exception. Etymologically the word `li<209>ga' stands for ç
that in which everything gets dissolved (l<200>yate asmin iti li<209>ga<199>). ç
Li<209>ga also means an emblem. Hence the <185>ivali<209>ga is an ç
emblem of God <185>iva into whom everything gets dissolved at the ç
time of destruction of the created universe. Since God is beyond name ç
and form and since we cannot conceive of an abstract principle like ç
Him without the aid of concrete symbols, a rounded surface is perhaps ç
the nearest approach to him.
<185>ivali<209>gas may be cala (movable) or acala (immovable). The ç
acala-li<209>gas, also called sth<193>vara-li<209>gas, are the stone ç
li<209>gas permanently fixed in the temples. There are several varieties ç
of them classified under four or six or even nine groups. An acalali<209>ga ç
has three parts: Brahmabh<193>ga (square in shape), Vi<218><207>ubh<193>ga ç
(octagonal) and Rudrabh<193>ga (round). The first two parts are embedded ç
inside the pedestal, the third part alone being visible. This is the ç
one to which p<220>j<193> or worship is offered. Hence it is called ç
the `p<220>j<193>bh<193>ga.'

Rituals are an important aspect of every religion. If philosophy explains ç
the basic truths and mythology expounds the same through stories and ç
analogies, rituals give them a concrete shape and lay down the practical ç
disciplines to be followed which will ultimately lead to the realization ç
of those truths. In Hinduism such rituals are legion. In fact, even ç
the basic acts of our daily routine like cleaning the teeth or bathing ç
have been elevated to the level of a religious ritual. The idea is ç
that our whole life is a yaj<210>a (sacrifice) or s<193>dhan<193> ç
(spiritual practice).
@EMERGENCY = Practically all the rituals have to bepreceded by <193>camana ç
or ceremonial sipping of water. A few drops of water, as much as can ç
immerse a grain of blackgram, are taken in the palm of the right hand ç
cupped like a cow's ear (gokar<207>a) and sipped from the root of ç
the thumb (called brahmat<200>rtha). After sipping three times, various ç
parts of the body like the eyes, ears, nose, chest and head are touched ç
with the wet hand in a specified order. °camana should always be done ç
in the sitting posture.
@EMERGENCY = The process of <193>camana is believed to cover the pr<193><207>a ç

@N1 = (`conduct')
The sm<216>tis and dharma·<193>stras, thelaw books that regulate ç
the life of individuals, both at the personal and at the social level, ç
usually deal with three important  topics:  <193>c<193>ra  (ceremonial ç
duties), vyavah<193>ra (civil and criminal laws) and pr<193>ya·citta ç
(penances and expi-atory rites). Of the three, <193>c<193>ra usually ç
gets the prideof place. Literally, <193>c<193>ra means conduct. It ç
is often identified with sad<193>c<193>ra, the conduct of good and ç
great men, so much so that dharma (righteousness) itself is said to ç
be born out of <193>c<193>ra, `<193>c<193>raprabhavo dharma<199>' ç
(Mah<193>bh<193>rata, Anu·<193>sanaparva 161.172). Whenever one ç
is in doubt with regard to one's duty or action in a particular situation ç
in life, one is advised to seek the guidance of the wise elders of ç
impeccable character. Their words should be implicitly obeyed.
The <218>a<219>karmas, the six duties included under daily routine, ç
are the most important aspects of <193>c<193>ra at the personal level. ç
They are: sn<193>na (bath), sandhy<193> (thesandhy<193> ritual), ç
japa (repetition of mantra), devap<220>j<193> (ritualistic worship ç
of the family deity), homa (sacrifice), Vai·vadeva (offerings of cooked ç
food to all the gods) and <193>tithya (honouring the guests). Undergoing ç
the various sa<221>sk<193>ras (purificatory rites) and performing ç
the prescribed duties as per one's var<207>a (caste) and <193>·rama ç
(stage of life) are the other important aspects of <193>c<193>ra.
@SPACE1 = 
The word <193>c<193>ra is also used in the sense of `customs and tradition' ç
which is equally important. No doubt the Vedas arethe supreme authority ç
in all matters regulating the Hindu society. Since they do not deal ç
with the details of various problems that arise in the day-to-day ç
lifeand conduct of the individuals, one has to rely upon the sm<216>tis ç
(recorded collections of great sages) and sad<193>c<193>ra (the conduct ç
of great men). However, in matters of dispute, falling within the ç
jurisdiction of jurisprudence, <193>c<193>ra as custom and long-standing ç
tradition or usage, is often the decisive factor, provided it is not ç
against the spirit of the Vedas and sm<216>tis. Such <193>c<193>ra ç
can be de·<193>c<193>ra (pertaining to the particular region), j<193>ty<193>c<193>ra ç
(pertaining to the particular caste) or kul<193>c<193>ra (pertaining ç

In  ancient  India,  education,  the panacea for all maladies and ç
problems of life, was imparted more by personal contact than by lectures ç
and discourses. The student learnt more by observing the teacher's ç
life than by hearing his teachings. Hence the teacher had to `be' ç
that, which he wanted to `make' of his student. First `be' and then ç
`make.' It is this philosophy of education that is reflected in this ç
word `<193>c<193>rya.' It is only he who successfully gathers (<193>cinoti) ç
the essentials of dharma and wisdom from all sources and practises ç
them (<193>carati) in his own life, that deserves the appellation ç
`<193>c<193>rya.' In a more technical sense, the <193>c<193>rya is ç
one who performs the upanayana ceremony of the novice and imparts ç
the Vedas to him, along with the accessories known as the Ved<193><209>gas.
Great stress was laid on the quali-fications which the <193>c<193>rya ç
had to possess. Birth in a family known for its erudition and piety ç
was always recognised as highly desirable. Deep erudition in the branch ç
of the Veda he was required to teach was expected as a matter of course. ç
A pure and sinless life, serenity and composure, active interest in ç
imparting knowledge were the other qualifications looked for in the ç
<193>c<193>rya.
The word is also frequently used as an honorific to men of great erudition ç
andlearning, especially if they are the initiators of new schools ç
of thought or the revivers of old ones, like <185>a<209>kara, R<193>m<193>nuja, ç
Madhva and others.
The term is also applied to an adviser or preceptor guiding sacrificial ç
rites.

If the solid world we perceive with our senses is a wonderful phenomenon, ç
the unseen Power behind it is a deep mystery. The quest for the mode ç
by which this unseenPower has evolved into this tangible world has ç
resulted in several philosophical schools, often called `dar·anas,' ç
in the text-books of Hindu metaphysics. Of these, the Ved<193>nta ç
Dar·ana of B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a has attracted the maximum number ç
of commentators one of whom is Nimb<193>rka (11th-12th cent. <F51320P10MSC1>A. ç
D.<W1>). According to him, Brahman, the highest Reality, is a personal ç
God, identified with K<216><218><207>a or Hari. Brahman has two powers ç
cit-·akti (sentient power, i.e., the indi- vidual souls) and acit-·akti ç
(non-sentient power, i.e., nature). At the beginning of creation, ç
He manifests these two powers. From acit-·akti or acicchakti, there ç
is a gradual evolution of the entire material world.
This acicchakti manifests itself in three different forms: (1) the ç
pr<193>k<216>ta or what is derived from the prak<216>ti, primal matter, ç
responsible for the material world; (2) the apr<193>k<216>ta, the ç
non-material aspect, the stuff of the celestial bodies and objects ç
as also the regions where the Lord and the freed souls live; (3) k<193>la ç
or time.

@NT = Acintya-bhed<193>bheda School
There have always been two major but parallel currents of thought†advocating ç
j<210><193>na (knowledge) and bhakti (devotion)<192>in the Hindu religious ç
tradition, each getting the better of the other at certain periods ç
of history. The school of j<210><193>na or knowledge, based on the ç
Upani<218>ads and allied literature like the dar·anas has always stressed ç
that mukti (liberation from transmigratory existence) is possible ç
only through <193>tmaj<210><193>na or knowledge of the Self. The school ç
of bhakti or devotion, rooted in the <184>gveda, but dependent mainly ç
on the epics and the pur<193><207>as (mythological lore) has emphasized ç
that such liberation is possible only through the grace of God, bhakti ç
or devotion to God being the only means of obtaining it. Each of these ç
two schools, being unable to ignore the logical and psychological ç
force of the other, has been obliged to find a place for some of the ç
principles of the rival school though relegating them to an inferior ç
status. More sober thinkers have attempted at reconciling, even harmonising, ç
these two viewpoints with varying success. The best of such attempts ç
which has succeeded remarkably is found in that classic scripture ç
<185>r<200>mad Bh<193>gavatam, which itself is based on an earlier ç
work of a similar kind, <185>r<200> Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a. ç
The philosophical schools of bhakti, based onthese two and allied ç
works (e.g., Hariva<221>·a and Brahmavaivartapur<193><207>a) could ç
not disregard the Upani<218>ads or the Brahmas<220>tras (also called ç
Ved<193>ntas<220>tras, a work systematising the philosophical ref- ç
lections scattered all over the Upani<218>ads) which had attained ç
a very highstatus among thinkers and religious leaders. Hence they ç
ventured to interpret the Brahmas<220>tras<|> and <|>the <|>Upani<218>ads<|> ç
by superimposing their views†commonly known as the Bh<193>gavata school<192>on ç
them. Though it is difficult to assess the degree of their success, ç
there is no doubt that they have enriched the Hindu philosophical ç
tradition. Among such Bh<193>gavata schools, those of Nimb<193>rka ç
(11th-12th cent.<F51320MS><|>A.D.<W1>), Vallabha and <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a ç
Caitanya or Caitanya (both of the 15th cent. <MS>A. D.<W1>) have gained ç
recognition and respectability. The religio-philosophical system propounded ç
by Caitanya (<MS>A.<|>D.<W1> 1485-1533), J<200>va Gosv<193>m<200> (16th ç
cent. <MS>A.<|>D.<W1>) and other scholar-mystics of Bengal is known ç
as the Bengal School of Vai<218><207>avism, also designated as the ç
`Acintya-bhed<193>bheda' school. This designation obtains from the ç
fact that the relationship between Brahman (God) on the one hand and ç
prak<216>ti (nature) and j<200>va (individual soul) on the other, ç
is `acintya' (incomprehensible) since both `bheda' (difference) and ç
`abheda' (non- difference) can be predicated of it.
The teachings of this school can be summarised briefly as follows: ç
The ultimate Reality is personal, (Brahman or) <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a, ç
the God of love and grace. He is the same as the Brahman of the Upani<218>ads. ç
He is sat-cit-<193>nanda (existence-consciousness-bliss-absolute). ç
He is infinite, omnipotent and omnipresent. He is the very embodiment ç
of all blessed qualities that we can ever conceive of. In this sense, ç
he is sagu<207>a (with attributes).
He has three ·aktis or powers: svar<220>pa·akti, m<193>y<193>-·akti ç
and j<200>va-·akti. By his svar<220>pa-·akti (also called cit-·akti) ç
he upholds his own existence and that of others, knows and makes others ç
know, enjoys and makes others enjoy bliss. These three characteristics ç
of his svar<220>pa-·akti corresponding to sat, cit and <193>nanda ç
aspects of his, are called sandhin<200>, sa<221>vit and hl<193>din<200> ç
·aktis respectively.
His m<193>y<193>·akti (also called acit-·akti or ja<195>a-·akti), ç
has two aspects: gu<207>am<193>y<193> comprising the three gu<207>as ç
of sattva, rajas and tamas; j<200>vam<193>y<193>, which makes the ç
j<200>vas (individual souls) forget their true nature and hence get ç
into the bondage of transmigration. God creates the universe by activating ç
this m<193>y<193>·akti. The created universe is real but transitory.
All the living beings form his j<200>va-·akti (also called ta<219>astha·akti).
Creation proceeds out of him by the exercise of m<193>y<193>·akti ç
and j<200>va·akti. M<193>y<193>-·akti evolves into the material universe ç
and j<200>va·akti involves the j<200>vas in it. The purpose of creation ç
is to give more opportunities for the j<200>vas to get mukti by striving ç
for it and by working out their karma.
God who is the very personification of love and joy, assumes infinite ç
forms including the avat<193>ras or incarnations in this world. Of ç
these, <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a is the chief. His supreme delight ç
is in love, manifested through the V<216>nd<193>vana-l<200>l<193>. ç
R<193>dh<193>, the doyen of the gop<200>s and the eternal divine consort ç
of K<216><218><207>a is actually the personification of his hl<193>din<200>·akti.
The j<200>vas who are infinite in number and different from God, are ç
conscious entities atomic in size. They get into the bondage of sa<221>s<193>ra ç
(transmigration) due to the ignorance of their real nature, brought ç
about by m<193>y<193>. Mukti is gained by breaking the bondage of ç
karma through bhakti or devotion to <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a. ç
This bhakti can be like that of the servant towards his master (d<193>sya-bhakti), ç
that of the friend towards his friend (sakhya-bhakti), that of the ç
parents towards their child (v<193>tsalya-bhakti) or that of the beloved ç
towards the lover (k<193>nt<193>-bhakti or madhura-bhakti).
For practising the spiritual disciplines leading to bhakti, guidance ç
from a competent guru (spiritual preceptor) is essential. Logic and ç
reasoning are not to be trusted in the path of religion since they ç
can undermine faith. Ethical virtues like compassion, tranquillity ç
and equani-mity, humility and freedom from passions should be cultivated. ç
Since all devotees are children of God, caste distinctions should ç
be ignored.
@SPACE1 = 
When bhakti matures into an abso-lutely pure and selfless state<192>called ç
keval<193> or ·uddh<193><192>the devotee aims exclusively at the loving ç
service of K<216><218><207>a as the nearest and dearest one, for his ç
happiness only and does not care even for mukti. This is posited as ç
the fifth puru<218><193>rtha. (See <MS>PURU<186>°RTHAS<D>.)
Though four kinds of mukti (See <MS>MOK<186>A<D>) like s<193>lokya ç
are recognised, the ·uddha-bhakta is not interested in them.
All this applies to the j<200>vas who are bound (baddha). There is ç
another class of j<200>vas known as nityamuktas (ever-free), who have ç
never been in bondage.
The word `acintya-bhed<193>bheda' itself needs some explanation. Hindu ç
philosophers are broadly divided into two groups, one holding the ç
view that in the ultimate analysis there is no difference (abheda) ç
between Brahman and the j<200>va; and the other accepting difference ç
(bheda). The Bengal school of Vai<218><207>avism differs from both ç
and calls itself `acintya-bhed<193>bheda- v<193>da,' since Brahman ç
and j<200>va are identical (abhinna) in some respects and different ç
(bhinna) in others, the very relationship being beyond our comprehension ç
(acintya). Both being cit (consciousness) are identical in that respect. ç
But Brahman is vibhu-cit (all-pervading consciousness) whereas the ç
j<200>va is a<207>u-cit (atomic consciousness). Again, the j<200>va ç
is an a<221>·a (part) of Brahman who is the a<221>·in (the whole). ç
Since the relation between the part and the whole is one of simultaneous ç
bheda and abheda, the same subsists between Brahman and j<200>va also. ç
How exactly this can be, is beyond human comprehension. Hence the ç
appellation.
@SPACE1 = 
On the side of dogma, this school accords <185>r<200> Caitanya the ç
same status as God since it believes that he is the combined incarnation ç
of R<193>dh<193> and K<216><218><207>a.
At the social level, the leaders of this school have contributed significantly ç
by removing caste distinctions and encouraging the cultivation of ç
primary moral and social values.

Man is a `thinking animal.' Once his animal needs are satisfied and ç
he obtains relative peace and stability in life, he starts thinking ç
about the `how,' the `why' and the `when' of things perceived. This ç
thinking about the origin and evolution of things has got to be in ç
the form of conjectures and hypotheses before being advanced as theories. ç
Such conjectures and hypotheses again, can start only from the seen ç
and the known before progressing towards the unseen and the unknown. ç
It is but natural that this world in which man lives, moves and has ç
his being (as it were), is the first to catch his attention. Such ç
attention and thinking often leads to a broad categorisation of the ç
created world. Of such categorisations, what can be more simple, direct ç
and obvious than the twofold one, viz., the living and the non-living, ç
the sentient and the non- sentient? This is exactly what the Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita ç
Ved<193>nta system†of which R<193>m<193>nuja (<F51320P10MSC1>A. D.<W1> 1017-1137) ç
is the chief exponent†has done.
According to this system, the ultimate Reality is threefold: cit (the ç
sentient), acit (the insentient) and ®·vara (God). The former two ç
are dependent realities, subservient to the latter. (For details see ç
<MS>VI<185>I<186><187>°DVAITA VED°NTA DAR<185>ANA<D>.)
The acit principle, as its very name indicates, is the matrix of all ç
that is without life and consciousness. Also called prak<216>ti (nature), ç
it is ja<195>a (lifeless and insentient) but capable of vik<193>ra ç
(modi- fication or evolution). It is avidy<193> (ignorance) since ç
it is opposed to true knowledge and also called m<193>y<193> since ç
it is the cause of all diverse creations. Being insentient it is incapable ç
of evolving by itself but does so under the controlling will of God.
According to one classification this acit has three aspects: the ·uddha-sattva, ç
the mi·ra-sattva and sattva-·<220>nya. The ·uddha-sattva aspect has ç
pure sattva gu<207>a(See <MS>GUØAS<D>.) capable of producing knowledge ç
and bliss, and is the matrix out of which the world Vaiku<207><219>ha ç
(See <MS>VAIKUØ<187>HA.<D>) has been made. It is un- affected by the ç
karma of the individual souls and is directly under the control of ç
God. The mi·ra-sattva aspect has the three gu<207>as of sattva, rajas ç
and tamas. It is this which evolves as this world, contracts and obstructs ç
the j<210><193>na (knowledge) of the j<200>vas (individual selves) ç
and sustains their bondage by producing vipar<200>ta-j<210><193>na ç
(knowledge opposed to their real nature). K<193>la or time forms the ç
third aspect viz., sattva-·<220>nya.
Whether k<193>la should be deemed as an aspect of acit or considered ç
as a special power inhering in God has been a point of debate among ç
the thinkers of the Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita school.

@NT = Acyuta Prek<218>a
It is often seen that some persons become known to history because ç
of their association with the more brilliant one who makes history. ç
Whether the former, though deserving better recognition, are overshadowed ç
by the latter, or, become known only because of their association ç
with the latter who are head and shoulders above them, is a matter ç
of opinion. Acyuta Prek<218>a, who gave sa<221>ny<193>sa to Madhv<193>c<193>rya ç
belongs to this group. Not much is known of him. As per the scanty ç
information available in the work Ma<207>ima<210>jar<200> of N<193>r<193>ya<207><193>c<193>rya ç
(14th cent. <F51320MS>A.D.<W1>), he was the head of the `Bha<207><195><193>ra-keri ç
Ma<219>ha.' His preceptor belonged to `°nanda-b<193>la Ma<219>ha' ç
and hailed from Nandigr<193>ma. Since there are several Nandigr<193>mas ç
in the country, it is difficult to decide which one it was. Acyuta ç
Prek<218>a was an advaitin and belonged to the Bh<193>gavata school. ç
It was he who administered the monastic vows and gave the newnames ç
P<220>r<207>a- praj<210>a, °nandat<200>rtha and others to Madhv<193>c<193>rya. ç
He had to accept defeat from his own disciple while teaching him. ç
In course of time, he was himself converted into a dvaitin.

@NT = Adbhuta Br<193>hma<207>a
Each of the four Vedas, the basic scriptures of the Hindus, is divided ç
broadly into two sections: the Mantra and the Br<193>hma<207>a. The ç
Mantra section contains prayers and hymns. The Br<193>hma<207>a section ç
deals with the application of these mantras in rituals.
@SPACE1 = 
The Adbhuta Br<193>hma<207>a forms the sixth (and the last) chapter ç
of a bigger work called <186>a<195>vi<221>·a Br<193>hma<207>a which ç
itself is the second of the nine Br<193>hma<207>as of the S<193>maveda, ç
available to us now. Though the first five chapters of the <186>a<195>vi<221>·a ç
Br<193>hma<207>a deal with the ceremonies and rituals connected with ç
the Somay<193>gas, the sixth one makes a comp-lete departure and deals ç
with strange phenomena like ill-omens and the expiatory rites that ç
help offset their effects. It is perhaps due to this reason that this ç
particular section is thus designated (adbhuta = wonderful, strange).
There are indications to prove that the <186>a<195>vi<221>·a Br<193>hma<207>a ç
originally consisted of only five chapters and the sixth i.e., the ç
Adbhuta Br<193>hma<207>a was appended to it later.
The entire book deals with adbhuta-·<193>ntis or appeasement of portents, ç
and is divided into twelve kha<207><195>as or sections. The various ç
portents indicating imminent dangers are described as being connected ç
with the gods like Indra, Yama, Varu<207>a and Vi<218><207>u; and ç
appropriate ·<193>ntis (rites of appeasement of the deities) are also ç
given. The idea seems to be that when these gods are displeased, troubles ç
start and when appeased through appropriate rites, they cease.
@SPACE1 = 
The list of portents given is quite long but interesting. Starting ç
from the breaking or damage of household articles for apparently no ç
reason, right up tonatural calamities like earthquakes, destruction ç
of crops and the fall of meteors, the list mentions the happening ç
of many unnatural and improbable phenomena also. Among such, it is ç
curious to note that temples shake and the idols of gods laugh, weep, ç
sing, dance or close their eyes! This is a clear indication that temples ç
with idols installed, had already come into being by the time of this ç
Br<193>hma<207>a.
