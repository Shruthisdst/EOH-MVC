@NT = <193>h<193>rya
@N1 = (`that which is brought')
During Vedic sacrifices, the first fire is normally produced by churning ç
the ara<207>is (See <MS>ARAØI<D> for details.). Subsequent fires can ç
be generated by taking the embers from the fire that is already lighted, ç
like the g<193>rhapatya. Such fire `that is brought' is called <193>h<193>rya.
@SPACE = 
@NT = <193>h<193>va
@N1 = (`calling')
Derived from the root `hve' (`to call') <193>h<193>va is the technical ç
name of a formula of summons pronounced loudly by the hot<216> (chief ç
of the priests representing the <184>gveda) in a Soma sacrifice ç
before starting the ·astra (laudatory recitation). It is usually in ç
the form of: ·o<221> 3* s<193>vom or ·o<221>s<193>vo 3 (a corrupt ç
form of ·a<221>s<193>va).
Soma juice is extracted (savana) three times during the day: morning ç
(pr<193>ta- ssavana), noon (m<193>dhyandinasavana) and later in the ç
day (t<216>t<200>yasavana). During all these three savanas <193>h<193>va ç
is done 4 times in the first, 5 times in the second and again 4 times ç
in the third.
The formula of reply by the adhvaryu (chief <|>of the priests representing ç
the Yajurveda) is called pratigara.

@NT = <193>havan<200>ya
@N1 = (`to be offered as an oblation')
Anyone who establishes the Vedic fires normally maintains three fires: ç
g<193>rhapatya, <193>havan<200>ya and dak<218>i<207><193>gni. Most ç
of the special sacrifices are performed in the <193>havan<200>ya which ç
is kindled by the fire brought from the g<193>rhapatya.
The mound of <193>havan<200>ya is square and is situated on the eastern ç
side of the sacrificial shed at a distance of twenty four padas or ç
steps from the g<193>rhapatya mound.
The fire is established at dawn when half of the sun's disc has risen ç
above the horizon. The adhvaryu lights a few fuel sticks on the g<193>rhapatya ç
fire and carries them in a vessel containing sand to the <193>havan<200>ya ç
mound chanting the appropriate mantras. After establishing the fire ç
it is propitiated with oblations of clarified butter and fuel sticks.
In case the fire goes out, prescribed pr<193>ya·cittas or expiations ç
should be under- gone. Reverencing it before death is believed to ç
confer celestial worlds on the sacrificer.

@NT = ahi<221>s<193>
@N1 = (`non-violence')
Ahims<193> or non-violence has been a highly extolled virtue throughout ç
Indian history. In fact, it is as old as the <184>gveda itself. ç
To quote one mantra: m<193> vo ghnata<221> m<193> ·apatam prati voce ç
deva yantam, `Return not blow for blow, nor curse for curse, neither ç
meanness for base tricks. Shower blessings instead' (<184>gveda Sa<221>hit<193> ç
4.1.8). Even during the Vedic period, when animal sacrifices existed ç
and the animals were believed to attain heaven, the animal meant for ç
immolation was made unconscious before being killed, so that it did ç
not suffer. Prayers were offered and expiations done to ward off the ç
effects of the sin of killing the animal which was inevitable in the ç
sacrifices (vide Taittir<200>ya Br<193>hma<207>a 3.7.9.8).
Coming to the Upani<218>ads, the earliest reference to ahi<221>s<193> ç
as an ethical discipline is found in the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad ç
(3.17.4; 8.15.1) where it has been bracketed with truth. The B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka ç
Upani<218>ad (5.2.3) emphasises the need for cultivating compassion, ç
the corollary of ahi<221>s<193>. The Mah<193>bh<193>rata often calls ç
it the highest dharma (ahi<221>s<193> paramo dharma<199><192> 1.11.13-14). ç
The pur<193><207>as and dharma-·<193>stras extol it in glowing terms. ç
It is even termed as `san<193>tanadharma' (the ancient religion) by ç
some pur<193><207>as like the Brahm<193><207>da and Matsya, and ç
also des-cribed as the gateway to dharma. The Yogas<220>tras of ç
Pata<210>jali (2.30) lists it as the first virtue to be cultivated ç
by the aspirant for yoga.
Ahi<221>s<193> is not injuring other living beings in thought, word ç
and deed. This is the ideal to be relentlessly pursued by those who ç
have dedicated their lives to the realization of the <193>tman (the ç
Self). For them it is a mah<193>vrata (great vow). Others should practise ç
it as far as possible.
That physical injury or harsh words inflict pain and suffering is ç
easily understood. However, what is not so easily understood is that ç
inimical thoughts that one harbours against others harm both. This ç
is a fact<192>whether one concedes it or not<192>as all minds, being ç
parts of the one cosmic mind, are interconnected, so that a thought ç
arising in one mind concerning another mind can always cause a reaction ç
in the other, good for good and bad for bad.
@SPACE1 = 
Ahi<221>s<193> can never be practised perfectly without its complement, ç
love. They are two sides of the same coin. Anyone who has practised ç
it effectively radiates a wonderful atmosphere of peace. Even animals ç
with mutual and natural enmity, if they come within the orbit of this ç
influence, live in peace and harmony (vide Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali ç
2.35).
Some of the pur<193><207>as (vide† Brahm<193><207><195>a 2.<|>36.<|>188) ç
recommended the killing of tyrants and desperados and opined that ç
such killing is no hi<221>s<193> at all, since many will live in happiness ç
and peace by their death.
Buddhism and Jainism have accorded ahi<221>s<193> the topmost place ç
among virtues to be cultivated. Jainism has carried it to rather extreme ç
lengths.
@NT = Ah<200>na
@N1 = (`lasting for several days')
Sacrifices are considered to be the links between men and gods like ç
Indra. Ah<200>na is one of the several kinds which come under the ç
Soma group of sacrifices. It is a general nomenclature for all Soma ç
sacrifices wherein the extraction of the soma juice is spread over ç
several days. Hence the name `Ah<200>na,' `that which takes several ç
days to perform'.
An Ah<200>na is always begun on a full-moon day. The extraction of ç
soma juice may be spread over 2 to 12 days. It should always end with ç
an Atir<193>tra (another Soma sacrifice spread over a day and night). ç
Along with the d<200>k<218><193> (consecration of the sacrificer at ç
the beginning) and upasad (another small sacrifice of the i<218><219>i ç
type) the whole sacrifice should not extend beyond a month.
The well-known A·vamedha sacrifice belongs to the Ah<200>na group.

@EMERGENCY = Among the extant Vai<218><207>ava °gamas of the P<193><210>car<193>tra ç
school, the Ahirbudhnya Sa<221>hit<193> is an important work. `Ahir-budhnya' ç
is one who, in the form of an `ahi' or serpent, is the `budhna' or ç
foundation ofthe world. So, literally it refers to <185>e<218>a or ç
Ananta, the thousand-hooded serpent, on whose head the world is said ç
to be supported, according to the accounts in someof the pur<193><207>as. ç
It is also mentionedas one of the names of <185>iva who, accordingto ç
the Vai<218><207>ava scriptures, is a great devotee of Vi<218><207>u. ç
In this work he is identified with <185>iva. `Sa<221>hit<193>' is ç
a general name given to any systematically arranged text.
@EMERGENCY = As in the case of many other Hindu religious works, it ç
is rather difficult to assign any date for this work. Otto Schrader ç
feels that it must have been composed later than <F51320P10MSC1>A. D.<W1> ç
300 (See his <F255P255MIC255>Introduction to the P<193><210>car<193>tra ç
and the Ahirbudhnya Sa<221>hit<193>, Madras: Adyar Library and Research ç
Centre, 1973.)
@EMERGENCY = The Sa<221>hit<193> opens with a dialogue between two ç
sages Bharadv<193>ja and Durv<193>sas. Bharadv<193>ja requests Durv<193>sas ç
to propound the mystery of Sudar·ana,the wondrous discus of Lord ç
Vi<218><207>u. Durv<193>sas agrees to narrate faithfully the teachings ç
given by Ahirbudhnya (<185>iva) to N<193>rada on this subject, but ç
only briefly. The original Sa<221>hit<193> before condensation is ç
said to have had 240 chapters. However, the present printed text has ç
3880 verses in the anu<218><219>ubh metre, spread over 60 chapters.
The teachings of this work can be briefly summed up as follows: Para- ç
brahman, the Absolute, is the highest Truth. He is One, without beginning ç
or end, all-pervading, free from all blemish, full and perfect. He ç
resides in all beings and is called N<193>r<193>ya<207>a. His real ç
nature can be experienced only in the state of liberation, which again ç
is possible only by His grace and not by one's own efforts.
He has two ·aktis or powers: kriy<193>·akti and bh<220>ti·akti. The ç
Sudar·ana cakra is actually the kriy<193>·akti representing the active ç
side or the energetic aspect of the Lord (chs. 3 and 8 to 12). When ç
it activates the bh<220>ti·akti which is the material cause of the ç
world, creation of the world takes place (ch. 5-7).
The created world which in the beginning is under the influence of ç
sattva, goes on smoothly for some time. As sattva diminishes increasing ç
the influence of rajas and tamas, people start going astray necessitating ç
the proclamation of the original <185><193>stra (holy book) viz., ç
the P<193><210>car<193>tra, by Sa<209>kar<218>a<207>a himself (an ç
aspect of Lord V<193>sudeva). The book describes the four aspects ç
of manifestation of the Supreme Lord: para, vy<220>ha, vibhava and ç
arca. (See <MS>P°<178>CAR°TRA °GAMA<D> for details.)
Then follow the descriptions of philosophical systems like Tray<200>, ç
S<193><209>khya and Yoga ending with the S<193>tvata (P<193><210>ca-r<193>tra). ç
It is interesting to note that Buddhism andJainism are dismissed ç
as ·<193>str<193>bh<193>sa (fallacious systems) invented by gods and ç
<216><218>is to spread confusion among the wicked!

The <|>summum <|>bonum<|> of<|> life <|>is `atyanta hita' (`greatest ç
well-being') which puts a permanent end to all suffering and gives ç

(knowledge), the former being the stepping stone for the latter. Both ç
these are described in the P<193><210>car<193>tra system, by following ç
which mok<218>a (liberation) can be gained.
Then there is a detailed description of mantras (sacred syllables), ç
characteris-tics of the <193>c<193>rya (preceptor), ·i<218>ya (disciple) ç
and d<200>k<218><193> (initiation). (vide chapters 18to20.)
Rak<218><193>s and yantras (magical diagrams), their worship and meditation ç
as also the fruits accruing from them are described next (chs. 21 ç
to 29). Practice of yoga is also dealt with in detail (chs. 30, 31). ç
Astras or magical weapons are another topic described in detail.
Human beings naturally desire cures from all physical and mental diseases. ç
This subject also has been dealt with. The cures suggested are ritualistic ç
or mystical. There is also a detailed description of the Mah<193>bhi<218>eka ç
(`great baptism') by the performance of which one can get rid of all ç
diseases (ch. 39).
There are a number of up<193>khy<193>nas (stories) given to illustrate ç
the effects of divine weapons and of certain amulets and talismans.
The great Sudar·anamantra, the root of all mantras, which enables ç
one to cause the Sudar·ana Puru<218>a to appear before oneself, is ç
another subject dealt with (chs.43, 44).
Other mantras described in the work are: t<193>r<193>mantra (i.e. ç
Om), mantras of Vi<218><207>u and N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, meaning of ç

According to the dharma·<193>stras, every dvija (`the twice-born,' ç
i.e., the br<193>hma<207>a, the k<218>attriya and the vai·ya) has ç
to follow a strictly regulated daily routine. Every item of it, even ç
those pertaining to the physical needs of the body, should be considered ç
and performed as a religious duty. Such an attitude is conducive to ç
his spiritual welfare.
Such duties as are to be performed during the course of an `ahan' ç
or day, are called `<193>hnika.' Day-time, for practical purposes, ç
was extended for a short time before sunrise and after sunset. This ç
period was usually divided into eight equal parts and different items ç
of the daily routine were assigned to different periods of the day.
Principal matters discussed under <193>hnika are: bodhana and utth<193>na ç
(getting up from the bed), ·auca (bodily purity), dantadh<193>vana ç
(brushing the teeth), sn<193>na (bath), sandhy<193> (prayers to be ç
offered atdawn), japa (repetition of mantras), tarpa<207>a (libations ç
to forefathers), pa<210>camah<193>yaj<210>as (five daily sacrifices), ç
homa (attending to the sacrificial fire), devap<220>j<193> (worship ç
of God), bhojana (taking food), arthasa<210>cayana (earning wealth), ç
sv<193>dhy<193>ya and pravacana (studying and teaching the Vedas), ç
evening sandhy<193>, d<193>na (giving gifts) and nidr<193> (going ç
to sleep).
Each one of these has been described in great detail in the sm<216>tis ç
and digests often noting the alternatives or variations. The more ç
important of these can be briefly described here.
Contemplating  on  God  and  holy beings is the first duty to be done, ç
on waking up. Answering calls of nature should be done in consonance ç
with the rules of health and sanitation. Bath shouldbe taken in cold ç
water, preferably in a river or a pond, repeating the Aghamar<218>a<207>a ç
s<220>kta, the Puru<218>a s<220>kta and other prescribed Vedic ç
hymns. A householder is expected to bathe twice a day, once before ç
sunrise and again before noon. While bathing, tarpa<207>a (offering ç
water ceremonially to gods, sages and manes) should also be done. ç
Along with wearing fresh washed clothes after bath, putting the tilaka ç
or caste mark (<220>rdhva-pu<207><195>ra, tiryakpu<207><195>ra, candana ç
and so on) is also recommended. Then come the sandhy<193> ritual and ç
G<193>yatr<200> japa. This is followed by homa, offering libations ç
of milk in the consecrated fire. Study of Vedic texts, feeding guests ç
and animals, devoting time to the earning of wealth for maintain- ç
ing the family are other items of daily routine.

@N1-1 = (`the Ahobila Monastery')
Ma<219>has (monasteries) and ma<219>h<193>dhi-patis (pontiffs) have ç
played a very signi- ficant role in spreading, consolidating and preserving ç
Hindu religion and culture among the masses. A ma<219>ha is more than ç
just a monastery, though the residence of the monk or monks is an ç
important and integral part of the same. A temple, an auditorium and ç
a school for the pursuit of religious and philosophical studies exist ç
invariably in any ma<219>ha of repute.
Among the more well-known of such ma<219>has, the Ahobila Ma<219>ha ç
of the <185>r<200>-vai<218><207>avas which follows the Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita ç
school of philosophy propagated by R<193>m<193>nuja (<F51320P10MSC1>A. D.<W1> ç
1017-1137) and others has carved out an important place for itself.
Ahobila is an important place of pilgrimage situated in the Ved<193>cala ç
hill range of the Eastern ghats. It is about 23 kilometers (15 miles) ç
from °<202><202>aga<195><195>a, in the Kurnool district of Andhra ç
Pradesh. When Mah<193>vi<218><207>u manifested himself in the form ç
of Narasi<221>ha (`man-lion') and killed the demon Hira<207>yaka·ipu ç
with his bare hands, the gods are said to have exclaimed `aho! balam!' ç
(`Wonderful is the strength!'). Since many stone icons of this Narasi<221>ha ç
aspect are found in the several `bilas' or caves of this place, the ç
place itself has been named `Aho-bilam.'
The founder-pontiff of the Ahobila Ma<219>ha was °diva<207>a-<185>a<219>hagopa-Yat<200>ndra- ç
Mah<193>de·ikan, known as <185>r<200>niv<193>sa in his premonastic ç
days. Born in <F51320P10MSC1>A. D.<W1> 1378 in Tirun<193>r<193>ya<207>apura ç
(the present Melkote near the Mysore City of Karnataka) and brought ç
up in a holy and scholarly atmosphere, <185>r<200>niv<193>sa was commanded ç
in a vision by Lord Narasi<221>ha to go to Ahobila and take sa<221>ny<193>sa ç
(monastic order). Accordingly he went there and wasinitiated into ç
sa<221>ny<193>sa by an old monkwho appeared there mysteriously, enlightened ç
him about the mission of his life and disappeared. Acting as the servant ç
of Lord Lak<218>m<200>-N<216>si<221>ha whose image he used to carry, ç
<185>a<219>hakopa established a chain of ma<219>has wherein he arranged ç
for the study of the works of R<193>m<193>nuja and Ved<193>nta De·ika. ç
He is said to have accorded some privileges to the lower classes in ç
the temples he built at Kadiri (Andhra Pradesh) and elsewhere. He ç
passed away in <F255P8C255>A. D.<F51320P10C1> 1458.
Among his successors, called J<200>yars, mention may be made of the ç
6th, Par<193><209>-ku·a (<P8W1>A.D.<P255D> 1499-1513) who was reputed ç
to have acquired extraordinary yogic powers, the 33rd, <185>a<219>hagopa ç
(the VI) (<P8W1>A. D.<P255D> 1853-1879) who converted robbers into ç
devotees, the 38th, <185>r<200>niv<193>sa (<P8W1>A. D.<P255D> 1905-1909) ç
who proved to be an excellent administrator, and the 40th, Ra<209>gan<193>tha ç
(the IV) (<P8W1>A. D.<P255D> 1915-1923) who was a rare combination ç
of scholarship and yogic powers.
Unlike the other ma<219>has, the Ahobila Ma<219>ha does not have a ç
Headquarters. It moves along with the J<200>yar, the pontiff. The ç
deity worshipped is known as M<193>lola Lak<218>m<200>-N<216>si<221>ha, ç
the image being of solid gold. Only the devotees of the Va<195>agalai ç

The officiating priest should subsist only on milk or vegetables or ç
fruits on the twelve preceding nights. Worship of Ga<207>e·a and the ç
navagrahas (the nine planetary deities), chanting of a number of <216>ks ç
(mantras from the <184>gveda) and homa are important items of the ç
ritual.

@N1 = (`born out of water or ocean')
When the devas (gods) and asuras (demons)  started  churning  the  k<218><200>ra- ç
samudra (milk-ocean) with a view to getting am<216>ta (ambrosia), ç
several divine and mysterious objects emerged, out of which the majestic ç
Air<193>vata (also called Air<193>va<207>a) the four-tusked white ç
elephant was one. Indra, the chief of the devas, chose it as his mount.
According to another version, Air<193>vata was the offspring of the ç
elephant Bhadramanasa which Indra claimed as his mount.
Indra, who is also the presiding god over rain, sends down rain while ç
sitting on this elephant. It is to this elephant that Indra threw ç
the sacred garland given by the sage Durv<193>sas, out of arrogance ç
and pride. The animal in turn threw it under its feet and trampled ç
it thus enraging the irascible sage who cursed Indra to lose his sovereignty.
Air<193>vata is also the name of the elephant supporting the earth ç
on its eastern quarter and is one of the eight elephants known as ç
a<218><219>adig-gajas, believed to be supporting the quarters.
It is sometimes described as the king of elephants and a prototype ç
of all the elephants (vide Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a 1.22).

@N1 = (`son of Itar<193>')
Aitareya, also known as Mahid<193>sa Aitareya, is the <216><218>i ç
(sage) credited with the authorship of the Br<193>hma<207>a, °ra<207>yaka ç
and Upani<218>ad (of the <184>gveda) that go in his name. The Ch<193>ndogya ç
Upani<218>ad (3.16.7) mentions him as having lived for 116 years ç
as a result of meditating upon his life as a yaj<210>a or sacrifice. ç
This has become known as `puru<218>ayaj<210>a.'
According to other accounts given in the pur<193><207>as, he was the ç
son of Itar<193> and M<193><207><195>uki (whence his name Aitareya). ç
Since he never spoke, the mother Itar<193>, thinking that he was dumb, ç
prayed to Mah<200> (mother Earth) who blessed him with divine knowledge ç
and wisdom (whence   the   additional   appellation Mah<200>d<193>sa ç
or Mahid<193>sa).
He was an ardent devotee of Lord V<193>sudeva and had been repeating ç
constantly the dv<193>da·<193>k<218>ar<200> mantra (the twelve-lettered ç
mantra, viz., `O<221> namo bhagavate V<193>sudev<193>ya'). Once the ç
Deity appeared to him in a vision and comman-ded him to take to the ç
second stage of life, that of the householder, to please his parents. ç
Accordingly he went to one Harimedhas who was performing a sacrifice, ç
exhibited his divine powers and knowledge and secured the hand of ç
his daughter in marriage as also enough wealth.
The Vedic sections associated with his name are said to have been ç
revealed to him in the yaj<210>a·<193>l<193> (sacrificial shed) of ç
Harimedhas.
@NT = Aitareya °ra<207>yaka
Each of the four Vedas, the basic scriptures of Hinduism, is again ç
divided into four parts: Sa<221>hit<193>, Br<193>hma<207>a, °ra<207>yaka ç
and Upani<218>ad.
The Aitareya °ra<207>yaka (2500 <F51320MS>B. C.<W1>) is one of the two ç
°ra<207>yakas belonging to the <F255MI><184>gveda, the other being <185><193><209>kh<193>yana ç
°ra<207>yaka. It has five main divisions each of which is also given ç
the appellation `<193>ra<207>yaka.' For instance, the first division ç
is called `pratham<193>ra<207>yaka,' the second `dvit<200>y<193>ra<207>yaka' ç
and so<|>on. The total number of adhy<193>yas or chapters is eighteen. ç
These adhy<193>yas are again subdivided into kha<207><195>as or small ç
sections.
The first <193>ra<207>yaka describes the `mah<193>vrata' which is ç
a part of the Sattra- y<193>ga known as `Gav<193>mayana' and performed ç
on the penultimate day. (See <MS>SATTRAY°GA<D> and <MS>GAV°MAYANA<D> ç
for details.) This rite derives its name primarily from the fact that ç
a s<193>man (a hymn from the S<193>maveda) called `mah<193>vrata' ç
is sung while offering a cup of soma juice to Praj<193>pati (`Father ç
of beings') who is also called `mah<193>n' (`the great one'). A priest ç
playing on a harp and another sitting on a swing, shooting of arrows, ç
mimetic fights, dancing with water pitchers on the head by the servants<192>these ç
are some of the important side-lights of the ritual.
The first three adhy<193>yas of the second <193>ra<207>yaka deal with ç
uktha or ni<218>kevalya ·astra, and describe pr<193><207>a, the vital ç
force and the greatness of puru<218>a (human being). Ni<218>kevalya ç
·astra consists of certain <184>gvedic stanzas which are to be chanted ç
(and not sung) at the time of pressing the soma juice during sacrifices ç
like Gav<193>mayana. Certain meditations connected with it are described.
The rest of this <193>ra<207>yaka (i.e., the fourth, fifth and sixth ç
adhy<193>yas) comprises the well-known Aitareya Upani<218>ad. (For ç
details see <MS>AITAREYA UPANI<186>AD<D>.)
The third <193>ra<207>yaka deals with the special up<193>san<193>s ç
or contemplations and their fruits connected with the sa<221>hit<193>-p<193><219>ha, ç
padap<193><219>ha and kramap<193><219>ha (the vedic texts and their ç
systematic breaking up for convenience in remembering and interpreting). ç
It also deals with the ari<218><219>as (ill-omens) manifesting through ç
certain physical signs like seeing the sun as moon, as not seeing ç
one's head through the mirror or through dreams, as seeing a man of ç
black complexion†all of which forebode death. Names of certain ancient ç
<216><218>is like <185><193>kalya, M<193><207><195><220>keya, P<193><210>c<193>laca<207><195>a ç
and T<193>rk<218>ya are mentioned as the propagators of the up<193>sanas.
The fourth <193>ra<207>yaka which is very short deals with the mah<193>n<193>mn<200> ç
mantras of S<193>maveda which are to be chanted on the fifth day ç
of the mah<193>vrata.
The fifth <193>ra<207>yaka which is the last, deals with many ritualistic ç
details of the mah<193>vrata.
Hindu tradition ascribes only the first three °ra<207>yakas to Aitareya, ç
the fourth and the fifth being attributed to °·val<193>yana and his ç
guru <185>aunaka.
@NT = Aitareya Br<193>hma<207>a
The Br<193>hma<207>a is the second important section of the Vedas, ç
the first being the Sa<221>hit<193>. Whereas the Sa<221>hit<193> is ç
in poetry and deals with a variety of subjects, the Br<193>hma<207>a, ç
which is in prose, confines itself to liturgy, describing the modus ç
operandi of the various sacrifices.
The Aitareya Br<193>hma<207>a (3000-2500 <F51320MS>B.C.<W1>) is the longer ç
one of the two extant Br<193>hma<207>as of the <F255MI><184>gveda†the ç
other being Kau<218><200>taki Br<193>hma<207>a<192>and is attributed ç
to Mahid<193>sa Aitareya (See <MS>AITAREYA<D> for details.). There ç
is reason to believe that this is, perhaps, an abridged edition of ç
an earlier and much bigger work. The book is divided into eight pa<210>cik<193>s ç
(quintets) each consisting of five adhy<193>yas or chapters which ç
are again subdivided into ka<207><195>ik<193>s or short sections. ç
In all, there are 285 ka<207><195>ik<193>s spread over 40 adhy<193>yas. ç
The language is almost as archaic as that of the Sa<221>hit<193> and ç
certain word-groups tend to appear repeatedly.
@SPACE1 = 
Since this work contains many details of sacrificial rites which are ç
rather bewildering to the modern mind, only a very brief summary of ç
the contents will be attempted here. The first thirteen adhy<193>yas ç
give a minute description of the various duties and responsibilities ç
of the hot<216> (principal priest of the <184>gveda) (See <MS>HOT<184><D> ç
for details.) in the sacrifice called Agni<218><219>oma. Agni<218><219>oma ç
being a prak<216>ti or prototype of all other Somay<193>gas (which ç
are its vik<216>tis or modifications or versions) it has been given ç
the pride of place here. Adhy<193>yas 15-17 describe the sacrifices ç
Ukthya, Atir<193>tra and <186>o<195>a·<200> which are all vik<216>tis ç
of Agni<218><219>oma. The 18th adhy<193>ya deals with the Sattray<193>gas ç
(which take a full year to perform) and the part the hot<216> is expected ç
to play in it. The next six adhy<193>yas (19 to 24) concern themselves ç
with the sacrifice called Dv<193>da·<193>ha, the emphasis again being ç
on the instructions to the hot<216>s. Agnihotra is described in the ç
25th. The duties of the hot<216> and his assistants in the Somay<193>gas ç
which take several weeks are described in the five adhy<193>yas 26 ç
to 30. The last two pa<210>cik<193>s comprising adhy<193>yas 31 to ç
40, contain interesting material from which plenty of information ç
can be gathered on contempo-rary history. R<193>jas<220>ya sacrifice ç
is the main theme of the adhy<193>yas 31-35. It is here that we come ç
across the well-known story of <185>una··epha and Hari·candra. The ç
last section (adhyay<193>s 36 to 40) deals with the coronation of ç
Indra and gives a long list of the various kings who were coronated ç
by <216><218>is following the same pattern of Indra's coronation. ç
The work ends with the exhortation to the king to appoint a purohita ç
(priest) and the qualifications thelatter has to possess to deserve ç
the honour.
Some of the special features of this Br<193>hma<207>a may now be noted: ç
It appears that the deity Vi<218><207>u was highly respected by the ç
Vedic society of that time. A number of earlier religious works are ç
quoted from which we can surmise the existence of other Br<193>hma<207>a ç
works which are not available now. It is interesting to note that ç
the workcriticises the views of other works and earlier teachers, ç
if and when found necessary.
@SPACE1 = 
Out of the several <216>ks (<184>gvedic mantras) quoted here, a few ç
have not been found in the extant <184>gveda Sa<221>hit<193>. Perhaps ç
another ·<193>kh<193> or branch of the <184>gveda Sa<221>hit<193> ç
different from the <185><193>kala recension  available  now,  must  have ç
existed.
The whole text is overwhelmingly weighed in favour of the sacrificial ç
system of religion leaving practically no room for metaphysical ideas ç
as, for instance, in the Upani<218>ads.
By the time of this Br<193>hma<207>a, °ryan culture had already spread ç
to Eastern India, though Central India continued to be the heart of ç
it. Kings of the Kuru-P<193><210>c<193>la race were ruling in Central ç
India. Kings of the east were called `s<193>mr<193><219>' andof the ç
south `bhoja.' Emperors who conquered these used to assume titles ç
like `ekar<193><219>,' `s<193>rvabhauma' or `parame<218><219>hin.' ç
They believed that the rite `mah<193>bhi<218>eka' (by which Indra ç
was coronated) would induce in the king the necessary power and inspiration ç
to achieve this sovereignty.
Emperors and kings were fond of performing long and complicated sacrifices, ç
especially the `mah<193>bhi<218>eka.' Curds, honey, ghee and water ç
were being used in this rite for anointing and sprinkling. Though ç
the State exercised full control over the people, the br<193>hma<207>as ç
were deemed to have transcended it.
The book contains a list of twelve kings who underwent this mah<193>bhi<218>eka ç
rite. Janamejaya, the great-grandson of Arjuna as also Bharata, the ç
son of Du<218>yanta and <185>akuntal<193> are included in this list.
Though the people were ardently devoted to the sacrificial rites they ç
had not neglected the life here and now. Br<193>hma<207>as vied with ç
one another to exhibit their erudition while the k<218>attriyas did ç
the same in the field of physical prowess and skill in arms.

@NT = Aitareya Upani<218>ad
@EMERGENCY = The Upani<218>ads which usually form the last part of ç
the Vedas and hence known as Ved<193>nta (anta = end) contain the ç
quintessence of Hindu philosophy. They deal with certain fundamental ç
questions of metaphysics: the Creator, process of creation, nature ç
of the created world, true and apparent nature of the individual, ç
relationship between this individual and the Creator, goal of life ç
and the path that helps achieving it.
Out of the ten or twelve Upani<218>ads considered more ancient and ç
important the Aitareya Upani<218>ad is also one. It forms part of ç
the Aitareya °ra<207>yaka (adhy<193>yas 4 to 6 of the 2nd °ra<207>yaka) ç
of the <184>gveda. Mahid<193>sa Aitareya who is mentioned in the ç
Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad (3.16.7) is the <216><218>i to whom this ç
Upani<218>ad was revealed.
@EMERGENCY = The previous parts of the °ra<207>yaka contain instructions ç
regarding karma (Vedic rituals) and pr<193><207>op<193>san<193> (meditation ç
on pr<193><207>a, the vital breath or energy). Anyone who has performed ç
these two seriously and sincerely will become fit for <193>tmaj<210><193>na ç
(self-knowledge). This has been expounded in the next three (4 to ç
6) adhy<193>yas which comprise this Upani<218>ad.
The Upani<218>ad starts with a description of creation. In the beginning ç
the °tman alone existed. He reflected: `Let me create the worlds.' ç
Then he created four <|>worlds: <|>ambholoka<|> (supercelestial region ç
of waters), mar<200>ciloka (the heavens with their celestial lights), ç
maraloka (themortal earth) and <193>poloka (the subterranean region ç
of waters). Desiring to create the protectors for these worlds, he ç
proceeded to create first, Vir<193><219>puru<218>a (`World-Person')†an ç
intermediate entity subsisting between the °tman and the universe<192>whom ç
he fashioned out of the waters. From him proceeded the organs of senses, ç
then their corresponding functions and lastly the deities or cosmic ç
powers corresponding to such functions in the cosmos.
The °tman who can now be called ®·vara, made the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a ç
subject tohunger and thirst. Consequently the deities born out of ç
him also became subject to the same limitation. On the request from ç
the deities for a suitable locus from which they can act, he created ç
the human body into which they gladly entered. Hunger and thirst which ç
were left behind were also provided a place, but as an integral part ç
of these deities.
On further reflection, realizing the need for `food' by the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a ç
along with the deities, ®·vara created food articles like corn and ç
animals. The Vir<193><219>-puru<218>a was able to grasp this food ç
only with the ap<193>nav<193>yu (the pr<193><207>ic energy responsible ç
for digestion and excretion) and not withthe other deities (or indriyas, ç
i.e., faculties).
Since the body of the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a could not live without ç
the presence of the °tman or ®·vara, he entered into it through the ç
brahmarandhra (the aperture in the crown of the head).
@SPACE1 = 
The Upani<218>ad then describes how the j<200>v<193>tman (the <193>tman ç
bound in the body) transmigrates, conception, birth and rebirth being ç
his three kinds of births. It also quotes the great sage V<193>madeva ç
who realised his true nature as the <193>tman, free from the shackles ç
of bodies and senses, even while he was in the womb of his mother.
The last section describes °tman orBrahman as `praj<210><193>na' ç
(consciousness) because  of  whose  presence  only  all experience ç
is possible. One of the four famous mah<193>v<193>kyas (great dicta) ç
of the Upani<218>adic literature viz., praj<210><193>na<221> brahma ç
(`Praj<210><193>na is Brahman') comes in this section (3.1.3).
Out of the several theories of creation given in the Upani<218>ads, ç
the one given here appears to be more enigmatic if not altogether ç
inscrutable. However, a little reflection is enough to convince that ç
it falls in line with the general philosophy of the Upani<218>ads. ç
The various accounts of creation given in the Upani<218>ads normally ç
fall into three categories: through triv<216>tkara<207>a (triplication) ç
as in the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad<|>; through pa<210>c<200>kara<207>a ç
(quin- tuplication) as in the Taittir<200>ya Upani<218>ad; and  through  the  Vir<193><219>puru<218>a  (cosmic ç
person) as here.
@SPACE1 = 
The purpose of creation is to give the unredeemed j<200>vas (individual ç
souls) one more chance for redemption. This means that each of the ç
j<200>vas must have a suitable body and a sphere of activity. The ç
latter is provided by the various lokas or worlds, states of being, ç
and the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a forms the matrix as it were from which ç
the former is shaped. Apart from the physical body, the sense-organs ç
and the mind, located in it, form the basis of all activity. Hence ç
their creation has also been des-cribed. The deities like Agni and ç
°ditya mentioned here are the lokap<193>las, `protectors of the worlds'. ç
They are the entities endowed with the power of maintaining order ç
in the created worlds. At the cosmic level, each of them represents ç
the totality or  essence  of  that  particular  power manifested in ç
creation. At the individual level, it is the controlling power of ç
the particular faculty. For instance, Agni at the cosmic level represents ç
the fire-principle, whereas the same at the level of the individual ç
body represents the power of speech which illumines the dark areas ç
of unknown fields of knowledge.
The `hunger and thirst' of the deities is a sign of their incompleteness ç
and hence indicates that they too have fallen into the ocean of sa<221>s<193>ra ç
(transmigratory existence). This is but natural since the whole of ç
the created world, starting with the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a himself, ç
is within the realm of sa<221>s<193>ra. Their `food' is the corresponding ç
object of sense, united with which, the deities feel satisfied.

@NT = aitihya
@N1 = (`traditional teaching')
The word is derived from `iti + ha' (`it seems, it was so'). It refers ç
to legends and because of their didactic value, they are cherished ç
and preserved as a part of ancient tradition. The paur<193><207>ikas ç
(bards) consider it as a source of knowledge valid like pratyak<218>a ç
(direct perception), anu-m<193>na (inference) and <193>gama (scriptural ç
testimony).
The incidents related in the aitihyas usually have a historical basis. ç
In course of time, fact and fiction get fused into an integrated whole. ç
At this distance of time, it is often impossible to distinguish fact ç
from fiction. However, Hindu tradition has always accorded it a very ç
high place.

@NT = aja
@N1 = (`unborn,' `uncreated')
Etymologically the word means that which is unborn or uncreated. Hence ç
it is applied to all the three deities of the Hindu Trinity viz., ç
Brahm<193>, Vi<218><207>u and <185>iva. It is also applied to the ç
<193>tman or the self since according to the Hindu scriptures, it ç
is uncreated.
In the Vedic liturgical works, the word <|>denotes <|>the<|> he-goat, ç
<|>considered sacred to P<220><218>an (an aspect of Sun) and associated ç
with the sacrificial horse in the A·vamedha<|> (horse-sacrifice)<|> ç
which<|> is believed to lead the horse to the next world. The skin ç
of a sacrificed goat was used in the Vedic funerary rites for laying ç
the dead body.
In astronomy `aja' indicates the sign Aries.
The <185>vet<193>·vatara Upani<218>ad (4.5) compares prak<216>ti ç
or nature to aj<193> (she-goat) of three hues (red, white and black, ç
an obvious reference to the three gu<207>as of sattva, rajas and tamas) ç
and the j<200>v<193>tman to aja (he-goat) and depicts him as the enjoyer ç
of prak<216>ti.
@SPACE = 
@NT = Aja
Aja is a well-known king of the Ik<218>v<193>ku race. He was the son ç
of Raghu, father of Da·aratha and grandfather of R<193>ma. He was ç
christened `Aja' (= the unborn, i.<|>e., Brahm<193>) since he was born ç
at br<193>hm<200>muh<220>rta (the hour preceding sunrise considered ç
as related to Brahm<193>, the Creator). Indumati, the Vidarbha princess ç
was his queen. She was a celestial maiden born as a human being as ç
a result of a curse. She was delivered from the curse by the sage ç
N<193>rada. Her untimely death  left  Aja  inconsolable.  K<193>lid<193>sa ç
devotes three sections (sargas 5, 6 and 7) of his famous poetical ç
treatise Raghu-va<221>·a to the story of Aja and Indumati.
The <184>gveda (7.18.19) has used the word to indicate the people ç
of the country of Aja who honoured Indra after his victorious war ç
against Bheda, the enemy of Sud<193>sa.
@NT = aja<195>a
@N1 = (`that which is not inert')
Literally the word aja<195>a stands for any active and sentient principle ç
as opposed to ja<195>a, the inactive and the insentient. However it ç
is used as a technical term in the Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita school ç
of philosophy, the chief exponent of which was R<193>m<193>nuja (<F51320P10MSC1>A. ç

ja<195>a and aja<195>a. Prak<216>ti or nature and k<193>la, or time ç
are grouped under ja<195>a. ®·vara (God), J<200>va (individual soul), ç
nityavibh<220>ti (immaterial infinite domain of ®·vara) and dharmabh<220>taj<210><193>na ç

@NT = Aj<193>mila
Every saint has a past and every sinner a future. Tears of repentance ç
wash off the sins. Lord's name purifies even the vilest of sinners. ç
A typical example of transformation is Aj<193>mila whose legend inspires ç
the devotees of God even today.
Bh<193>gavata, the classic scripture of devotion and spiritual wisdom, ç
recounts the ancient tale of Aj<193>mila (6.1 and 2) and glorifies ç
devotion to Vi<218><207>u.
Born and brought up as a pious br<193>hma<207>a, he once fell a victim ç
to the infatuations of a slave girl and married her after deserting ç
his legally wedded wife and children born of that wedlock. To maintain ç
her and the brood of her children, he took to sinful ways of life ç
like cheating and robbery. When he lay in his deathbed he saw the ç
fierce-looking messengers of Yama (the king of death), got frightened ç
and started calling his last son, N<193>r<193>ya<207>a by name. The ç
very utterance of this name, being the name of Lord Vi<218><207>u, ç
brought His servants also on the scene. Then as Vi<218><207>u's servants ç
intervened on behalf of Aj<193>mila (since what he had uttered was ç
the divine name, the very utterance of which destroys all sins) there ç
ensued a dialogue between them and the messengers of Yama. Hearing ç
this dialogue wherein the glory of the divine name was extolled, Aj<193>mila ç
broke down with repentance. Strangely enough he recovered, butrepaired ç
to the bank of the sacred river Ga<209>g<193>, practised severe austerities, ç
engaged himself in the repetition of the divine name and attained ç
liberation after death.
@NT = Ajant<193>
Celebrated for its cave-paintings, Ajant<193> is actually a range ç
of hills in the Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra State. It was originally ç
known as °j<200>ntha.
The caves are situated at a distance of 6.5 kms. (4 miles) from the ç
village Fardapur, which itself is 101 kms. (63miles) from Aurangabad, ç
the district head-quarters.
They are excavated in the semicircular scarp of a steep rock, about ç
76 metres (250 ft.) high overlooking a narrow sinuous gorge, through ç
which flows a stream called Waghora, descending at the head of a ravine ç
as a waterfall.
There are 30 caves in all including the unfinished ones. They must ç
have been carved out during the period, 2nd century <MS>B.<|>C.<D> ç
to the 7th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>
Some of them contain inscriptions which are also dated.
The caves were probably excavated for the use of the Buddhist (H<200>nay<193>na) ç
monks for their retreat in the rainy season.
Some of them are caityas (See <MS>CAITYA<D>.) whereas the others are ç
vih<193>ras (monasteries).
A remarkable feature of these caves is the paintings on their frescoes. ç
They depict the various episodes of Buddha's life as also a few aspects ç
of the contempo-rary social life. The 16th, 17th and the19th caves ç
contain some remarkable paintings.
The caves contain charming sculptural decorations also.
@NT = ajap<193>-japa
@N1 = (`silent repetition')
Japa (repetition of the name of God) is considered to be one of the ç
easiest and most efficacious means of attaining spiritual illumination. ç
Lord K<216><218><207>a goes to the extent of identifying himself with ç
it and calls it a yaj<210>a or sacrifice (Bhagavadg<200>t<193> 10.25). ç
When japa is practised constantly and continuously, practically with ç
every breath, it gets merged as it were with theprocess of breathing ç
itself. Such an unconscious andautomatic japa is christened `ajap<193>-japa.'
Though theoretically, any mantra pertaining to any deity can be chosen ç
for this purpose, in practice this is always confined to the `ha<221>samantra.' ç
`Ha<221>sa<199>' is the abbreviation of `aha<221> sa<199>' (`I am ç
He') or its more well-known form ``so'ham'' (`He, Iam'). With every ç
inhalation the syllable `ha<221>' is repeated and with every exhalation ç
the syllable sa<199>. Deliberate and conscious practice of this will ç
gradually result in automatic and unconscious repetition coeval with ç
breathing. It is only then that it becomes `ajap<193>japa.'
``Ha<221>-sa<199>'' or ``so'ham'' is actually the same as the mah<193>v<193>kyas ç
(the great dicta of the Upani<218>ads†See <MS>MAH°V°KYAS<D> fordetails.) ç
aham brahma asmi (`I am Brahman') or tat tvam asi (`You are That'). ç
In these statements `aham' or `tvam' represents the j<200>va or the ç
individual soul; `brahma' or `tat' stand for the Supreme Soul or the ç
Absolute. Since the two are apparently poles apart, they can never ç
be identical. However, when only their essential characteristic, viz., ç
caitanya or pure consciousness is considered, they can be considered ç
identical or as the same.
According to the Tantras, `ham' repre-sents the <185>iva principle ç
and `sa<199>' represents the <185>akti principle. So `ha<221>sa<199>' ç
stands for their union and the entire universe created from that union.
@SPACE1 = 
Literally ha<221>sa means a swan. Swan is the vehicle of Brahm<193> ç
the creator. Ha<221> and sa<199> represent the inspired and expired ç
breath. Everything movable and immovable ``breathes'' or vibrates ç
and hence can be denoted by `ha<221>sa.' Therefore it is meet that ç
Brahm<193> the creative aspect of the Supreme Self is represented ç
as seated thereon.
The Ha<221>sopani<218>ad (15) describes the cosmic form of God using ç
the ha<221>sa imageryto facilitate meditation. The same Upani<218>ad ç
also relates the experiences that arise as a result of the ajap<193>japa ç
of ha<221>sa- mantra (16).
Repetition of the ha<221>sa-mantra or ajap<193>japa is also known ç
as Ajap<193>ha<221>sa-vidy<193>.

@N1 = (`One whose enemy is not born')
A term often met with in Sanskrit works, it means `one whose enemy ç

cannot be challenged by any as an enemy. More often it signifies a ç
man who is so good, compassionate and noble that none hates him. Yudhi<218><219>hira, ç
the eldest of the P<193><207><195>avas possessed such qualities and ç
hence is known by that name.
The B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka Upani<218>ad mentions one Aj<193>ta·atru, ç
the king of K<193>·<200> (2.1) who was a great j<210><193>ni and who ç
taught the <216><218>i D<216>pta B<193>l<193>ki. The story is repeated ç
in the Kau<218><200>taki Br<193>hma<207>a Upani<218>ad (4.1) also.
According to the Buddhist lore, Aj<193>ta·atru, the son of king Bimbis<193>ra, ç
and a ruler of Magadha committed several heinous crimes, repented ç
of them and approached the Buddha for solace. It was on this occasion ç
that the Buddha taught the well-known S<193>m<193><210><210>aphala ç
Sutta.
The fortress of P<193><219>al<200>putra, the capital of Magadha, was ç
built by him.
@NT = aj<193>tiv<193>da
@N1 = <M>(`doctrine of non-origination')
Creation of the world is one of the fundamental problems invariably ç
discussed in the Indian philosophical systems. In whichever way a ç
system posits the basic reality<192>as one or many<192>from which ç
the world has evolved, logical and ontological difficulties can never ç
be avoided. Gau<195>ap<193>da (7th cent. <F51320P10MSC1>A. D.<W1>) the guru ç
of <185>a<209>kara's preceptor, and the famous author of the <F255P255MIC255>K<193>rik<193>s ç
(concise commentary in verses) on the M<193><207><195><220>kya Upani<218>ad ç
hassuccessfully tackled this problem by denying the problem itself!
@EMERGENCY = Considered as the earliest writer on Advaita Ved<193>nta, ç
Gau<195>ap<193>da takes the extreme view that Brahman or °tman alone ç
is the only reality that exists and hence neither the world nor the ç
j<200>va (individual self) ever comes into being. Since Brahman has ç
no birth (j<193>ti = birth or origination) nor modification, his doctrine ç
is termed aj<193>tiv<193>da (K<193>rik<193>s 4.71).
@EMERGENCY = Brahman alone is real. Anyone who sees the world of duality ç
as existing and tries to discover its origination from Brahman is ç
trying to `see the footprints of the birds in the sky' (ibid 4.28)!
@EMERGENCY = Gau<195>ap<193>da establishes his aj<193>tiv<193>da ç
basing  his  arguments  on  the  ·rutis (revealed scriptures viz., ç
the Upani<218>ads) as well as logic and reasoning. He admits that ç
the Upani<218>ads have described creation but aversthat they have ç
never declared it to be real (3.15). The main purport of such statements ç
is to emphasize the non-dual Reality behind this apparent diversity.
After<|> successfully<|> countering <|>the arguments  of  all  other  schools  and ç
establishing his aj<193>tiv<193>da, Gau<195>ap<193>da goes to the ç
extent of denying even aj<193>ti! Since the very concept of an external ç
world which includes the so-called revealed scriptures, is an illusion, ç
even the theory of aj<193>ti established on the basis of such scriptures ç
and logic, is an illusion! From the highest standpoint, the °tman ç
is not aja (unborn) also. He is beyond all relative descriptions and ç
hence defies all such attempts (4.74).

@NT = ajina
Ajina is skin in general and the skin of a black antelope in particular. ç
Hence the name k<216><218><207><193>jina. Throughout the ages it has ç
been a symbol of holiness and Vedic culture. Even the country °ry<193>varta, ç
has been defined as the territory where k<216><218><207>am<216>ga ç
or the black antelope wanders freely. The<185>atapatha Br<193>hma<207>a ç
(1.1.4. 1-2) compares yaj<210>a (sacrifice) to a black antelope with ç
white, black and yellow hair representing respectively the <184>k, ç
S<193>man and Yajus.
Being considered holy, it is often used in sacrificial rites for various ç
purposes as in husking grains from which cakes are made.
It is used by the brahmac<193>rin (celibate novice pursuing the Vedic ç
studies) and the yati or muni (ascetic) as a seat or spread or a couch.
A strip of k<216><218><207><193>jina used to be worn by the dvijas ç
in the earlier days as yaj<210>opav<200>ta (sacred thread) which was ç
later replaced by the thread.
@NT = aj<200>va
@N1 = (`the non-living or inanimate')
Jaina metaphysics divides dravya or substance into two broad groups: ç
astik<193>ya (that which has a body and hence extended in space) and ç
anastik<193>ya (that which has no body). The astik<193>yas are again ç
sub- divided into j<200>va (animate) and aj<200>va (inanimate). Aj<200>va ç
is further subdivided into dharma (the medium necessary for motion), ç
adharma (medium necessary for rest or immobility), <193>k<193>·a (space) ç
and pudgala (matter).
@NT = °j<200>vakas
@N1 = (`life-longers,' `mendicants')
India has been a land of ascetics and asceticism since millennia. ç
The <193>j<200>vakas (sometimes misspelt as <193>j<200>vikas also) ç
a group of such ascetics mentioned in the edicts of A·oka pillars ç
seem to be an ancient order of some standing.
According to their tradition Nanda-vatsa, K<216>·a-S<193><209>k<216>ty<193>yana ç
and Ma<209>khal<200>-putta or Maskarin Go·<193>la are the three great ç
teachers from whom the sect originated and got stabilised. Historians ç
believe that Go·<193>la was a younger contemporary of Mah<193>v<200>ra, ç
the last of Jaina T<200>rtha<209>karas. Jaina texts like the Uv<193>sagadas<193>o ç
graphically describe the conflict between them triggered off by the ç
desertion of Sadd<193>la-putta of the °j<200>vaka sect who went over ç
to the Nirgrantha sect of M<193>h<193>v<200>ra.
Not much is known of the doctrines of this sect. They practised severe ç
auste- rities and were probably followers of Ha<219>hayoga and occultism. ç
That they might have lived in caves is suggested by the inscriptions ç
of A·oka mentioning the dedications of cave-dwellings for their use ç
in the Barabar hills of Bihar. They might have practised nudity.
Ghurye feels that the sect had a house-holder section also (G. S. ç
Ghurye, Indian S<193>dhus, Bombay, Popular Prakashan, 1953, p. 36).
Except  for  some  references  in Buddhist works like the D<200>gha ç
Nik<193>ya, there is practically no literature left about their philosophy. ç
They were probably fatalists, agnostics or even atheists.
Whatever might have been their philosophy, they once commanded respect ç
and influence in the society and were rivals of the Jaina ascetics.
Practice of unsocial customs, perhaps cost them their popularity.
@NT = <193>j<210><193>cakra

The <193>j<210><193>cakra is the subtle centre of consciousness situated ç

received from Lord <185>iva. Hence the name.
For details see <MS>CAKRAS.<D>
@NT = aj<210><193>na
@N1 = (`non-knowledge')
The concept of aj<210><193>na is most funda-mental to Advaita Ved<193>nta. ç
In fact, it can be rightly called the cornerstone upon which the mighty ç
edifice of Advaita metaphysics stands.
Aj<210><193>na is not so much `ignorance' or `nescience' as `non-knowledge.' ç
It successfully prevents knowledge from arising. Once knowledge does ç
arise, aj<210><193>na just disappears! Rooted in j<210><193>na or ç
consciousness as its locus, it unfolds its charms and spells.
An oft-quoted illustration given in the works on Advaita Ved<193>nta ç
to explain aj<210><193>na is that of the rope appearing as snake (in ç
insufficient light) and nacre appearing as silver (in moonlight). ç
It is aj<210><193>na that is responsible for this appearance. Since ç
the snake and silver are actually perceived†unlike the son of a barren ç
woman or the horns of a hare<192>they are not asat (unreal). Since ç
they disappear on the rise of the knowledge of their substratum viz., ç
the rope and the nacre, they are not sat (real) either. Hence aj<210><193>na, ç
responsible for this phenomenon is described as sad-asad-vilak<218>a<207>a, ç
(different from both the real and the unreal), just as the neuter ç
gender is different from both the masculine and the feminine genders.
This aj<210><193>na is said to be bh<193>var<220>pa (existent) since ç
it is experienced as indicated in such statements as `I do not know ç
anything' or `I am ignorant;' or since it does not cause the rope ç
and the nacre disappear completely from view. It is endowed with two ç
·aktis or powers viz., <193>vara<207>a·akti (veiling power) and vik<218>epa·akti ç
(transforming power). It veils the true nature of rope and nacre and ç
shows up snake and silver in their place by apparently transforming ç
them.
Aj<210><193>na at the cosmic level is termed m<193>y<193> and is often ç
identified with prak<216>ti (nature) with its three gu<207>as sattva, ç
rajas and tamas. At the individual level it is more commonly called ç
`avidy<193>' and is held responsible for the apparent limitation of ç
the <193>tman (the Self) as j<200>va (embodied being subject to transmigration).
@SPACE1 = 
In conclusion it can be said that in Advaita Ved<193>nta, j<210><193>na ç
refers to caitanya or pure consciousness which is one and infinite. ç
Hence a-j<210><193>na is that phenomenon which makes this infinite ç
appear as many and finite.

Utsavas or religious festivals are the heart of popular religion. ç
Among the many festivals of Hinduism, Durgotsava is consi-dered very ç
important and is very popular too, especially in Bengal, Bihar and ç
Assam. It is a festival dedicated to the worship of Durg<193>, the ç
<185>akti or Mother-goddess, and is usually done to a consecrated ç
clay image. After the festival is over, the image is taken out in ç
a procession and is immersed in the waters of the sea, a river, a ç
lake or even a big tank.
According to the Hindu mythological literature, the gods of the Hindu ç
pantheon go to sleep during the month of °<218><193><195>ha (June-July) ç
and wake up during the month of K<193>rtt<200>ka (October-November). ç
Since the Durgotsava is celebrated during the month of °·vina or °·vayuja ç
(September-October), from the 6th to the 10th days of the bright half, ç
the goddess Durg<193> will still be asleep. She has to be woken up ç
for the worship. This ceremonial awakening of the deity is known as ç
`ak<193>la-bodhana' or `bodhana' since<|>the waking up (bodhana) is ç
being done at an odd time (ak<193>la = untimely, odd time).
According to the Bengali tradition of this worship, R<193>ma is said ç
to have awakened and worshipped Durg<193> before the final encounter ç
with R<193>va<207>a, the demon king of La<209>k<193>, on the 9th day ç
of °·vina bright half and achieved victory by her grace on the 10th, ç
now known as `Vijayada·am<200>.' He had to do this since his need ç
was very urgent. This legend appears in the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
of K<216>ttiv<193>sa (15th century <F51320MS>A. D.<W1>) in Bengali. Thus ç
the tradition of worshipping Durg<193> during °·vina is said to have ç

°k<193>·a, the sky, with its firmament dotted with stars, planets ç

different angle. Is it empty space, a hollow vacuum? Or, is it a material ç
substance, however fine and subtle it may be?
As in the case of other subjects of philosophical enquiry, here also ç
various viewpoints have emerged.
In Jaina metaphysics, <193>k<193>·a is consi-dered as space, eternally ç

astik<193>yas or extended substances. J<200>vas (souls), pudgala (matter), ç
dharma and adharma (substances responsible for mobility and immobility)<192>all ç
exist in <193>k<193>·a. It is too subtle to be perceived by the senses. ç

(space contain- ing the world of souls and matter) and alok<193>k<193>·a ç
(empty space beyond such world).
In the Vai·e<218>ika system <193>k<193>·a is considered as a dravya ç
or substance, one of its nine kinds. It is the all-pervading substratum ç
of the quality of sound.
The S<193><209>khya, the Yoga and the Ved<193>nta systems consider ç
<193>k<193>·a as one of the five tanm<193>tras (potential elements ç
or generic substances) pertaining to sound. The <193>k<193>·a that ç
is experienced by us (it is one of the pa<210>camah<193>bh<220>tas ç
or five elements) is formed by these tanmatras by the process of pa<210>c<200>kara<207>a ç
or quintupli- cation. (See <MS>PA<178>C®KARAØA<D> for details.)
According to the process of creation as described in the Upani<218>ads, ç

@NT = akha<207><195><193>k<193>ra-v<216>tti
@N1 = (`modification in the form of the Partless')
Advaita Ved<193>nta advocates nidi-dhy<193>sana or meditation on the ç
nature of the <193>tman as the means for its realization. This should ç
be preceded by ·rava<207>a (hearing about the <193>tman from the guru ç
or preceptor) and manana (reflection leading to a clear concept and ç
conviction). Once the nature of the <193>tman is comprehended, and ç
a clear idea formed in the mind, maturing into a deep conviction, ç
meditation can be proceeded with.
In meditation, the mind takes the form of the object presented to ç
it. Such modifications are called v<216>ttis and are like waves unto ç
water. When each succeeding wave is similar to the preceding wave, ç
meditation results.
The object of such meditation in Advaita Ved<193>nta is the °tman ç
itself, which again is identical in its essence with Brah- man, the ç
Absolute. Brahman is akha<207><195>a, partless, since it is a homogeneous ç
reality, nay, the only Reality that exists. So, when the mind starts ç
meditating on Brahman which is akha<207><195>a, its v<216>ttis take ç
on the form of akha<207><195>a-Brahman. Such v<216>ttis are called ç
akha<207><195><193>k<193>ra-v<216>ttis. When this meditation ripens ç
into sam<193>dhi (absolute concentration), the v<216>ttis die down ç

@N1 = (`devotion that does not ask for anything else')
From  the  beginning  two  main currents of religious thought have ç
existed in the Hindu scriptures: that of j<210><193>na (knowledge) ç
and that of bhakti (devotion).
The schools of devotion advocate that bhakti is the direct means to ç
mok<218>a (liberation) and even go to the extent of stressing that ç
it is much easier than j<210><193>na.
A devotee of God can cultivate bhakti for several reasons: to get ç
over his troubles, to get wealth, position or pleasures of life or ç
to realize God. It is the last category that is bhakti in the real ç
sense, the others being just trading in religion. A true devoteeof ç
God, called ek<193>ntin, wants Him and Him alone and nothing else. ç
Such a devotion is designated `aki<210>cana-bhakti,' a devotion that ç
does not want anything else from Him.

In Indian history, if the middle ages (<F51320P10MSC1>A. D.<W1> 900-1600) ç
were a `dark period' in the political sense, they also proved to be ç
the `golden era' from the standpoint of religious revival. Most of ç
the Bhakti Movements belong to this period. As against the movements ç
in the North, which were predominantly Vai<218><207>avite in character, ç
the movements in the South were both <185>aivite and Vai<218><207>avite, ç
the former being the more widespread. The movement of the <185>iva·ara<207>as ç
of Karnataka with its philosophy and religion of V<200>ra·aivism, ç
became<192>and still is<192>a force to reckon with. The stress on ç
bhakti (devotion) as an easy mode of s<193>dhan<193> (spiritual practice) ç
available to everyone and the loosening of the caste restrictions ç
among the bhaktas (devotees of God) thereby giving the masses a chance ç
to mix on equal terms with the classes, were the special features ç
of this movement.
Among the sixty well-known mystics of the V<200>ra·aiva movement most ç
of whom were men, Akka Mah<193>dev<200> (also known as Mahadeviyakka) ç
has occupied an impor- tant place. Born probably in <F51320P10MSC1>A. D.<W1> ç
1130 at U<195>uta<195>i (a village in the Shivamogga District of Karnataka) ç
as the only child of a devout <185>aiva couple, she had instinctively ç
cultivated madhurabhakti, loving God Cannamallik<193>rjuna (an aspect ç
of <185>iva)as her spouse. In her youth, Kau·ika, the king of the ç
place sought her hand in marriage. She married him after laying down ç
certain conditions. When these conditions were broken by him she renounced ç
the world and went away as a wandering  minstrel.  At  Kaly<193><207>a  in ç
northern Karnataka she joined the group of devotees of the anubhava-ma<207><219>apa ç
(a forum for discussion and exchange of views on spiritual life and ç
experience) led by Basave·vara and Allama Prabhu. After being initiated ç
by Basave·vara and feeling spiritual elevation, she retired to <185>r<200>·aila ç
(now in Andhra Pradesh) where she was `united with her Lord <185>iva,' ç
probably in <MS>A. D.<W1> 1166.
Unlike the vacanas<192>a kind of lyrical prose†of Basave·vara and ç
others, her vacanas describe her longing for union with her divine ç
spouse and the joy of fulfilment. A few of them also deal with the ç

Japa or repetition of a mantra (a set religious formula or a name ç
of God or of a deity) is considered an important aspect of spiritual ç
and religious discipline. Since a count of such repetition should ç
be kept, devices for keeping such count are common to all religions. ç
One important device is the m<193>l<193> or rosary.
@SPACE1 = 
A rosary made of rudr<193>k<218>a beads called ak<218>am<193>l<193> ç
(Elaeocarpus ganitrus or its berries) is very common. The number ç
of beads may vary: 32, 54, 64 or 108. There will be one bead extra, ç
which will be bigger than the others or fixed above the others. This ç
is called `meru' and should not be crossed over during counting.
Certain icons of gods (for e.<|>g., <185>iva, Sarasvat<200>, Brahm<193>) ç
are shown with the ak<218>am<193>l<193> in one of their hands.

the aspects connected with <185>aivism) and belonging to the <184>gveda, ç
the Ak<218>am<193>lik<193> Upani<218>ad is a minor work in prose. ç
It deals with the ritual consecration of a japam<193>l<193> or rosary. ç
It is in the form of a dialogue between Praj<193>pati and Guha (also ç
known as Skanda, K<193>rttikeya and Subrahma<207>ya, son of P<193>rvat<200> ç
and <185>iva), the latter being the preceptor.
The japam<193>l<193> can be made of beads of ten substances: coral, ç
pearl, quartz, conch,silver, gold, sandalwood, seeds of putraj<200>vik<193> ç
(Roxburghii), seeds of lotus and rudr<193>k<218>a (Elaeocarpus ç
seeds). The string that holds them together can be made of gold, silver ç
and copper, the three wires being twisted into one.
The Upani<218>ad then gives the process of contemplation on various ç
deities like Brahm<193>, Vi<218><207>u, <185>iva and Sarasvat<200> ç
as situated in the various parts of the japam<193>l<193>. This is ç
followed by a ritualistic process of cleansing the japam<193>l<193> ç
with pa<210>cagavya, the five products of a cow like milk and curds. ç
(See <MS>PA<178>CAGAVYA.<D>) Then comes a long section describing ç
the infusing of each of the beads with the power of the deities presiding ç
over the fifty alphabets of the Sanskrit language, by relating one ç
bead with one letter of the alphabet. This is repeated again after ç
50 beads. The appropriate mantras or esoteric formulae to be used ç
are also given.
After this, prayers are offered to the deities residing on earth, ç
in the sky and in heaven, as also to the pit<216>s or manes, to reside ç
in the beads and make the japam<193>l<193> holy and effective.
The Upani<218>ad ends with prayer to the rosary thus consecrated and ç
a eulogy of this science given in it.

so on. It is for this reason that the Hindu mythology uses the word ç

Ak<218>ara also signifies Pra<207>ava or Om,the monosyllable that ç

Temples are an integral part of Hindu religion and culture. The building ç
of a temple is considered a very sacred act. It is built according ç
to a plan and pattern as given in the °gamas. The image of the Chief ç
Deity installed in the main shrine (garbhag<216>ha) is the central ç
focus of the whole temple complex. This image is prepared strictly ç

Indian philosophical thought has reached its acme in the Upani<218>ads. ç
Coming as a reaction to Vedic ritualism and priestcraft it had to ç
stress the need for realizing the spiritual dimensions of man. The ç
sages of the Upani<218>ads, with their deep insight into human nature, ç
knew that a total break with the past would be rather difficult for ç
the men steeped lifelong in rituals. Wishing to lead them to higher ç
levels of spiritual experience, step by step, these sages devised ç
several up<193>san<193>s or Vidy<193>s (mystic meditations) often ç
based on the same rituals which they practised.
One of these Vidy<193>s that occurs in the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad ç
(4.15 and 8.7.4) is the Ak<218>ipuru<218>avidy<193>. `Ak<218>ipuru<218>a' ç
means `the person seen in the eye.' He is identified with the <193>tman. ç
Obviously he cannot be the reflection seen in the eyeball. He is the ç
person who animates the eye and enables it to see. Or he is the person ç
seen through the inner eye after purifying the mind through disciplines ç
like brahmacharya or celibacy. Actually he is the dra<218><219><193>, ç
the seer and not d<216>·ya, the seen. He is Brahman. Meditation upon ç
him as the seer or even as the eye that sees everything else is Ak<218>ipuru<218>avidy<193>. ç
The fruits of such meditation are believed to be obtaining all good ç
things, shining in all worlds and after death, not being reborn.

@NT = Ak<218>i Upani<218>ad
This is one of the minor Upani<218>ads belonging to the K<216><218><207>a ç

It starts with the visit of the sage S<193><209>k<216>ti to °dityaloka, ç
the world of °ditya or Sun-god, and pleasing him with a laudatory ç
hymn. This hymn has been called `c<193>k<218>u<218>mat<200>-vidy<193>.' ç
The Sun-god who is the deity presiding over light in the external ç
world and the power of sight in the bodies of living beings, declares ç
that whosoever recites this hymn regularly everyday will not be affected ç
by diseases of the eye. Since this Upani<218>ad thus begins with a ç
hymn connected with the `ak<218>i' or the eye, it has been named Ak<218>i ç
Upani<218>ad.
The sage S<193><209>k<216>ti then beseeches Lord °ditya to teach him ç
Brahmavidy<193> or knowledge of Brahman. This question leads to a ç
fairly long discourse by °ditya on quite a few of the well-known Ved<193>ntic ç
doctrines. A major part of this is devoted to a description of the ç
seven bh<220>mis or planes of yogic state.
In the first state, the yogi looks uponeverything as the one, the ç
unborn, indestructible, eternal Principle. This gradually leads to ç
a natural dissolution of the mind wherein nothing except that one, ç
is experienced. This is yoga. Trying to remain in that state, the ç
yogi performs all actions. He is detached from all the internal mentalimpressions, ç
but performs all good actions, actions which will not cause agitation ç
in others' minds. He loves all and speaks words suitable for the time ç
and place. He serves the holy ones in all ways. He is interested in ç
reflecting upon the holy scriptures.
In the second state, the yogi approa-ches people well-versed in the ç
scriptures and learns from them about ·rutis (Vedas), sm<216>tis (secondary ç
scriptures), sad<193>c<193>ra (good conduct) and yogic practices like ç
dh<193>ra<207><193> (attention) and dhy<193>na (meditation). He tries ç
to transcend the six evils like pride and greed.
@SPACE1 = 
In the third state he fixes his mind on the truths of the scriptures ç
after hearing about them from the <216><218>is in the V<193>naprastha ç
stage of life. He observes hard austerities like lying on a bed of ç
stone and roaming in the forests, to develop non-attachment. He develops ç
great detachment to all the things of life†pairs of opposite<192>taking ç
them as either due to the previous karma or as the will of God.
In the fourth state, the yogi has transcended duality, is established ç
in the advaita or non-dual state of consciousness and hence perceives ç
the world only as a dream.
In the fifth state, even this perception of the world as a dream disappears.
In the sixth state, his mind gets attenuated further, advaitic consciousness ç
becomes stronger, and doubts and bonds disappear. He is, for all practical ç
purposes, a j<200>vanmukta or `one who is liberated even while living.'
The seventh state, which the Upani<218>ad  call s as  `videhamukti'  is ç
characterized by total freedom from all bonds, rules and regulations ç
and deep constant experience of the highest identity with  Param<193>tman  or  V<193>sudeva,  the ç
Supreme God.

yogabh<220>mis or planes of psychic and spiritual experience mentioned ç
in the text books of yoga. This is called `alabdha- bh<220>mikatva.' ç
This is primarily due to the evil sa<221>sk<193>ras or impressions ç
carried over from past lives, which drain all the energy generated ç
by yogic practices even as rat-holes in a field drain the water with ç
which it is irrigated. With the help of the guru (spiritual preceptor) ç
and by deep introspection he can discover his weaknesses and try to ç
eliminate them by proper practices.

When R<193>va<207>a usurped La<209>k<193> from Kubera (the king of ç
wealth), the latter retired to Kail<193>sa and propitiated Lord <185>iva ç
through severe austerities. <185>iva got another beautiful city built ç
by Vi·vakarma (the chief architect of the gods) and presented it to ç
Kubera. This is Alak<193>pur<200> or Alak<193>.

Objects and scenes of natural beauty of this universe of phenomena ç
have always fascinated the Hindu mind. Mountains, forests, rivers ç
and seas have invariably provided the inspiration to build places ç
ofpilgrimage where human beings can contemplate the Divine and feel ç
elevated.

Of the many rivers of India, Ga<209>g<193> (Ganges)   stands   unparallelled   and ç
supreme with regard to holiness and the number of places of pilgrimage ç
associated with it. Alakanand<193> is one of its important tributaries ç
which joins it at an early stage.
