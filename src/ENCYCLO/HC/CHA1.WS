@SPACE = 
In the Indian philosophical systems, the word has been used widely ç
to denote consciousness. Some systems like the Ved<193>nta, identify ç
it with the <193>tman/ Brahman.
The  C<193>rv<193>kas  (materialists)  who admit of only four bh<220>tas ç
or fundamental elements consider consciousness as the property of ç
the body and a product of these elements, like the intoxicating power ç
of a drink being produced by the chemical combination of certain things. ç
The Ny<193>ya and Vai·e<218>ika schools consider it as a quality of ç
the soul produced in it by its conjunction with the mind and other ç
conditions of knowledge. The M<200>m<193><221>sakas and Jainas also ç
hold the same view. The Buddhist schools consider it as a series of ç
momentary cognitions, each revealing itself. But S<193><209>khya, ç
Yoga and Advaita Ved<193>nta systems consider it as the very nature ç
of the soul, knowledge being only a manifestation or reflection of ç
consciousness on the v<216>ttis or modifications of the mind.
These schools usually recognize three states of consciousness: j<193>grat ç
or waking state, svapna or dream state and su<218>upti or deep-sleep ç
state. In the waking state knowledge is produced by the contact of ç
the sense-organs with the sense-objects. In the dream state it is ç
produced through sa<221>sk<193>ras or past impressions, eventhough ç
there is no contact between the senses and the objects. In the deep-sleep ç
state, some schools like the Ny<193>ya aver that there is no knowledge ç
whereas the S<193><209>khya, Yoga and Ved<193>nta schools accept the ç
existence of a subtle kind of knowledge, a knowledge about the tamas ç
or nescience which prevails at that time.
In some of the monastic orders of the Da·an<193>m<200> group, this ç
word `caitanya' is used as an appellation to indicate the state of ç
a brahmac<193>rin, a novice under training for monkhood.

@N1 = (`with Citr<193>')
Caitra is the first month of the Hindu lunar calendar, and roughly ç
corresponds to March-April. It got its name from the fact that on ç
the full-moon day of that month, the moon would be in the asterism ç
Citr<193>. Nir<216>ti is the supervising deity of this month. Though ç
Citr<193> is no longer connected with this month now, the name still ç
continues as such.
@SPACE1 = 
The first day of this month is `Yug<193>di' (the beginning of the ç
yuga or Age), the New Year's day, celebrated with religious vows and ç
worship. The eighth day of thebright half is A·ok<193><218><219>am<200>, ç
a day on which goddess Durg<193> is worshipped with the flowers of ç
the A·oka tree. <185>r<200> R<193>ma-navam<200>, the birthday of the ç
epic hero <185>r<200>R<193>ma, is celebrated on the next day. In ç
the dark fortnight, Matsya Jayant<200> (on thefifth day) and Var<193>ha ç
Jayant<200> (on thefourteenth day) are the important festivals.

`Cit<193>' is the funeral pyre. `Caitya' is anything that is connected ç
with it. However in practice, a funeral mound, a tree with a rivetment ç
round its stem probably interring the remains of a hero, or even a ç
building serving the same purpose, have all been designated as caityas. ç
The term has also been used as a general nomenclature for any temple.
Over the years the word has acquired a peculiarly Buddhistic flavour. ç
Places† with or without a monument†such as Lumbi<207><200>, Gay<193>, ç
Vai·<193>l<200> or R<193>jag<216>ha associated with Buddha's life, ç
have come to be known as caityas. St<220>pas also have been called ç
caityas.
In the rock-cut cave temples of Buddhistic origin, Caitya Halls are ç
seen. They are apsidal, barrel-vaulted halls used to enshrine a st<220>pa.
@NT = cakra
@N1 = (`wheel')
The wheel of a chariot is frequently mentioned in the <184>gveda ç
as a symbol of the sun. In some of the hymns (vide 1.155.6) the ç
sun is compared to a wheel denoting the principle of time. The Kau<218><200>taki ç

In the Hindu mythological lore, the cakra†translated as `discus'†is ç
almost exclusively described as a weapon of war, especially of Vi<218><207>u/K<216><218><207>a. ç
It is called `Sudar·ana' (`that with a pleasing appea-rance') and ç
is shown with six spokes. This confirms the contention of the scholars ç
that it was originally a symbol of the sun and the six spokes represented ç
the six <216>tus or seasons. Sometimes the Sudar·ana-cakra is shown ç
personified as a minor deity with a hexagon in his background. Brilliant ç
as fire,<+>he has four or eight or sixteen arms holding bow, arrow, ç
trident, noose, goad and other implements as also weapons apart from ç
the usual Vai<218><207>avite symbols. Symbolically, he represents ç
the cosmic mind, the will of the Lord to multiply as well as his infinite ç
power to create and destroy the universe. The Sudar·ana-mantra†a special ç
formula pertaining to it†is said to possess the power to neutralize ç
poisons and exorcise malignant spirits.
In the mantra·<193>stras<192>sciences dealing with mystic formulae<192>six ç
`cakras' or arrangements of letters of the alphabet are described ç
which help in determining the suitability of a particular mantra fora ç
particular individual, depending upon his r<193>·i (zodiacal sign) ç
or nak<218>atra (asterism).
In Buddhism, the cakra symbolizes Dharmacakra, the Wheel of Law, its ç
eight spokes representing the eightfold path prescribed by Buddha ç
for attaining nirv<193><207>a or emancipation.
@NT = Cakradhara
@N1 = (`one who wields the discus')
Cakradhara, who is credited with the forming of the Mah<193>nubh<193>va ç
Sect of Maharashtra is said to have lived in the 11th cent. <MS>A.D.<D> ç
Some aver that the founder was Govinda Prabhu, a great mystic and ç
Cakradhara was only the first apostle. Cakradhara composed a number ç
of s<220>tras or aphorisms on this cult. This work is known as S<220>trap<193><219>ha ç
among its followers. The sect itself is of the Bh<193>gavata Cult ç
and bases its teachings mainly on the G<200>t<193>, the Bh<193>gavata ç
and the S<220>trap<193><219>ha.
The followers of this sect used to wear dark blue dress, probably ç
in imitation of the colour of Lord <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a.
Though the movement started in Maharashtra, somehow it did not become ç
very popular. Rather it fell into disrepute due to its neglect of ç
the Vedas and disregard for the caste and the <193>·rama systems. ç
This disrepute made the writers of this sect use esoteric and symbolic ç
language.
N<193>gadeva, Bh<193>skara, Ke·avar<193>ja S<220>ri and a few others ç
were its distinguished followers. N<193>gadeva is said to have organized ç
the cult on a systematic basis. There were women followers too, some ç
of whom were advanced mystics and poetesses of repute.
In the paur<193><207>ic and hymnal literature the word represents ç
Vi<218><207>u/N<193>r<193>ya<207>a/ K<216><218><207>a since he is ç
the wielder of the discus-weapon (Sudar·anacakra).

°yurveda or the science of life has long been accorded a very important ç
status among the various branches of knowledge in Hinduism. It is ç
the first of the four Upavedas or subsidiary Vedas.
Among the extant works on this science, the two that are considered ç
ancient and highly authoritative are Caraka Sa<221>hit<193> and ç

@N1 = (`worship in a circle')
The cult of the Dev<200> or the Divine Mother, though originating ç
from the <184>gveda  itself  (vide 10.125)  gradually developed ç
intotwo main channels: the dak<218>i<207>am<193>rga or the right-handed ç
path and the v<193>mam<193>rga or the left-handed path. The latter ç
was perhaps a grotesque metamorphosis brought about by non-Vedic aboriginal ç
and primitive cults. As a result many sex-rites made their way into ç
this left-handed path. The t<193>ntric literature is replete with ç
such rites.
One such abominable rite is the cakrap<220>j<193> or `worship in a ç
circle'. According to the Kaul<193>val<200>nir<207>aya, an equal ç
number of men and women, without distinction of caste or even blood ç
relationship, secretly meet at night and sit in a circle. The goddess ç
is represented by a yantra or diagram. The women cast their bodices ç
in a receptacle and each of the assembled men finds a female companion ç
for that night by picking up a bodice from the same.
Scholars are of the view that what might have been simple fertility ç
rites of the ancient days, aimed at increasing agricultural  production,  might  have ç
degenerated into such sex-orgies in the name of religion, especially ç
because of the perverted sexual desires of the wealthy and the powerful ç
persons in the society.

In admiration of this penance <185>iva shook his head and as a result, ç

@N1 = (`circles or centres')
The <185><193>kta °gamas, more commonly known as the tantras, declare ç
that the human body is a little universe in itself and that the various ç
tattvas or cosmic principles in creation are there embedded in it. ç
However, each of these tattvas has its own centre of activity, the ç
place where it is most preponderant and from where its<+>energies radiate ç
into the system. They have been called `cakras' (circles or centres) ç
and have often been likened to lotuses. They are not anatomical centres ç
like the nerve-plexuses but subtle seats of consciousness, of <185>akti ç
or divine Power.
Works on Yoga depict fourteen principal n<193><195><200>s or subtle ç
conduits for the flow of pr<193><207>ic energy, of which the su<218>umn<193>, ç
the i<195><193> and the pi<209>gal<193> are the most important ones. ç
The su<218>umn<193> is situated inside the spinal column and i<195><193> ç
and pi<209>gal<193> entwine it from left and right. All the three ç
start from the root of the spinal column and end near the centre of ç
the head.
Six cakras are described as being situated in this Su<218>umn<193>. ç
They are m<220>l<193>-dh<193>ra, sv<193>dhi<218><219>h<193>na, ma<207>ip<220>ra, ç
an<193>hata, vi·uddha and <193>j<210><193>. The seventh, the sahasr<193>ra, ç
is the final destination of the Ku<207><195>alin<200>·akti, the basic ç
power of the human organism which is likened to a coiled serpent lying ç
dormant at the m<220>l<193>dh<193>ra, until it is roused by appropriate ç
yogic exercises.
The m<220>l<193>dh<193>racakra is situated in the space between the ç
anus and the generative organ, at the root of the su<218>umn<193>n<193><195><200>. ç
It resembles a crimson lotus of four petals. It is the centre of the ç
principle of earth† p<216>thv<200>tattva†and controls the sense-organ ç
of smell as also feet, one of the organs of action. Brahm<193>, along ç
with his <185>akti S<193>vitr<200>, is the presiding deity of this ç
cakra.
The sv<193>dhi<218><219>h<193>nacakra, next in the series, is situated ç
at the root of the genitals and is placed inside the su<218>umn<193>. ç
It resembles a lotus of vermillion colour with six petals. It is the ç
centre of the principle of water†the aptattva†and controls the sense ç
organ of taste and also the hands from among the organs of action. ç
Vi<218><207>u along with his <185>akti R<193>ki<207><200>, is the ç
presiding deity of this centre.
Then comes ma<207>ip<220>ra, at the navel region. It resembles a lotus ç
of dark hue (like the rain clouds) with ten petals. It is the centre ç
of the principle of fire† tejastattva†and controls the sense-organ ç
of sight and the organ of action, the anus. Rudra with his <185>akti ç
L<193>kin<200> is the presiding deity.
@SPACE1 = 
The an<193>hata, situated in the region of the heart, resembles a ç
lotus of twelve petals of blood-red colour. It is the centre of the ç
principle of air†v<193>yutattva†and controls the sense of touch and ç
the genitals. ®·a with his <185>akti K<193>kin<200>, is the presiding ç
deity.
Next comes the vi·uddhacakra, in the region of the base of the throat. ç
It resembles a lotus of sixteen petals of smoky purple colour. It ç
is the locus of the principle of ether†<193>k<193>·atattva†and controls ç
the organ of hearing as also of speech. Sad<193>·iva with his <185><193>kin<200> ç
<185>akti is the presiding deity.
Last of this series of cakras, often designated as `<218>a<219>cakras', ç
is the <193>j<210><193>cakra situated in the region corresponding ç
to the middle of the eyebrows. It resembles a lotus of two petals ç
of white colour. It is the centre of the principle of mind. <185>ambhu ç
with his <185>akti H<193>kin<200> is the presiding deity.
Beyond this there is the sahasr<193>ra-cakra, resembling a white lotus ç
of a thousand petals, presided over by Parama-·iva himself. It hangs ç
from the brahmarandhra (opening at the top of the skull) and above ç
the su<218>umn<193>, head downwards.
In fact all these cakras hang head downwards only, until they are ç
pierced by the Ku<207><195>alin<200>, after it is roused from its ç
slumber by appropriate yogic practices. This piercing of the cakras ç
by the Ku<207><195>alin<200> is called `<218>a<219>cakrabheda'. When ç
the Ku<207><195>alin<200> reaches the sahasr<193>ra and gets united ç
with Parama·iva, the yogi will go into sam<193>dhi, the superconscious ç
state, experiencing ineffable bliss.
The tantras also describe the various results that accrue to a person ç
who contemplates on these cakras in the prescribed manner.

The concept of an emperor, a sovereign monarch ruling over vast areas ç
and having vassal kings, is not unknown to the ancient Hindu scriptures. ç
The Aitareya Br<193>hma<207>a (ch. 39) mentions the names of several ç
emperors such as Janamejaya, <185>at<193>n<200>ka and Bharata. In ç
the later recor-ded history, several kings have tried to attain the ç
status of emperors. A·oka, Har<218>avardhana and Samudra Gupta are ç
instances to the point.
The word `cakravartin' along with the word `samr<193><219>' has commonly ç
been used to denote an emperor. Literally, the word may mean `one ç
whose cakra or wheel of the chariot rotates (vartanam = rotation) ç
unimpeded,' thereby signifying his absolute conquest over the land. ç
According to the science of Hindu physiognomy, anyone who has the ç
sign of a `cakra' (wheel, discus or lotus) on his hand is a `cakravartin,' ç
and is destined to become an emperor.
Sometimes the word `cakra' is interpreted as `ma<207><195>ala' or ç
circle of kings, cakravartin being their overlord.
A cakravartin is said to possess `seven jewels' (saptaratna). They ç
are: cakra, chariot, jewel, queen, wealth, horse and elephant. Here ç
`cakra' may mean the auspicious sign of the Sudar·anacakra of Lord ç
Vi<218><207>u on his hand.
In Jainism, the word is used as an epithet for a group of twelve great ç
souls like Bharata and Brahmadatta. They were emperors in the spiritual ç
field.

`Cak<218>urvrata,' also called `netravrata,' is performed on the second ç
day of the bright half of the month Caitra (March-April). The performer ç
has to worship the A·vins (twin deities, said to be the physicians ç
of gods identified with the sun and the moon) and has to subsist only ç
on curds and ghee. It can be done only once or repeated for twelve ç
years. The performer is assured of a good eyesight. If the vow is ç
kept up for twelve years, he will become a king.

@N1 = (`the eye')
Eye is the most important of all the sense organs. The sun is described ç
by the Vedas as the eye of all that exists.
According to the Upani<218>ads the power to see that exists in the ç
eye, and the power of light capable of revealing objects, that exists ç
in the sun, are both essentially the same; and, °ditya is the deity ç
that presides over both. When a human being dies, his `eye' (the power ç
to see) gets merged in the °ditya.
Belief in the evil influence of the eyes of some people (d<216><218><219>ido<218>a) ç
is common to India as to many other countries. It is said to cause ç
death, illness, injury, poverty and other evil effects. Children and ç
animals are said to be more vulnerable to it. Hence the use of amulets, ç
countercharms and protective gestures has been resorted to over the ç
years. According to the Atharvaveda, an amulet of the `ji<209>gi<195>a' ç
plant gives such protection. The same Veda (2.7.5) contains a hymn ç
called `Cak<218>urmantra' directed against curses and those who curse, ç
the invoker requesting for the possessor of the `evil eye' to be harmed ç
(so that he will not harm others).
Cak<218>u is the name of one of the seven branches of the river Ga<209>g<193> ç

The ·ailaja or stone li<209>gas are generally worn on the body by ç
the followers of <185>aiva cults like the li<209>g<193>yats. The k<218>a<207>ika ç
li<209>gas are shaped out of riverside sand or clay, uncooked or cooked ç
rice, cowdung, butter, sandal paste, flour or jaggery. They are made ç
for the occasion and then disposed off, soon after the worship is ç
over.
Worship of different kinds of li<209>gas confers different results. ç
For instance, that of gold li<209>ga gives wealth; that of cooked ç
rice, plenty of food; that of cowdung, freedom from diseases.
Baked clay li<209>gas are used for <193>bhic<193>rika purposes, i.e., ç
for harming others through black magic.

`Camar<200>-m<216>ga' is the animal yak normally found in Tibet. A ç
long chowrie prepared from the hairs on the bushy tail of the yak ç
was commonly used by the attendants of a king as a sort of a fan, ç
to ward off flies and insects. However, in course of time, it became ç
a part of the royalinsignia, along with the chatra or umbrella. It ç
is used in the ceremonial worship of a deity also, at the time of ç
<193>rati or vespers.
C<193>mara, according to the Dev<200>-m<193>h<193>tmya section of ç
the M<193>rka<207><195>eya Pur<193><207>a, was one of the generals ç

Out of the several implements used in a Vedic sacrifice, `camasa' ç
is an important one. It is a kind of cup, with or without a handle, ç
usually square in shape and made of the nyagrodha wood (Ficus indica). ç
The handle could be round, square or even triangular.

It is generally used for containing the Soma juice for libation, for ç
drinking the same by priests, and for bringing the `pra<207><200>t<193>' ç

Out of the sixteen priests involved in a sacrifice, only ten are entitled ç
to have camasa and they are called `camasins'.

@NT = Camp<193>
Camp<193>, variously known as Camp<193>-pur<200>, Campak<193>vat<200>, ç
Camp<193>nagara and so on, was the capital of the once well-known ç
A<209>gade·a. Romap<193>da, father of <185><193>nt<193> and father-in-law ç
of the famous sage <184><218>ya-·<216><209>ga, was the king here in ç
very ancient times. R<193>m<193>ya<207>a mentions it. During the ç
times of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata Kar<207>a was ruling from here.
@SPACE1 = 
It has been identified with Nathnagar near Bhagalpur in Bihar.
Some scholars opine that the famous Buddhist work, the La<209>k<193>vat<193>ra-s<220>tra ç
wascomposed here probably in the 4th century <MS>A.D.<D>
Camp<193> is said to be the birthplace of V<193>sup<220>jya, the twelfth ç
T<200>rtha<209>kara and also associated with the last, Mah<193>v<200>ra.
Hindu religion, culture and way of life had spread beyond the borders ç
of India even from the ancient days. There are archaeological, epigraphical ç
and other evidences to prove its existence in the South East Asian ç
countries from the 1st century <MS>A.D.<D> The kingdom of Camp<193>†the ç
South Annam region of Vietnam†is a country of this group.
One <185>r<200>m<193>ra established a Hindu dynasty there in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
192. The kingdom itself†though the rulers changed now and then<192>continued ç
till <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1471 when it was annexed by the kings of Annam.
Among the several distinguished rulers of Camp<193>, the names of ç
Bhadravarma, Rudravarma, Harivarma, Mahendra-varma, Jayasi<221>havarma ç
and Jaya Indra-varma may be mentioned. They were all Hindu rulers ç
and had adopted Hindu ways of administration. Most of them were well- ç
versed in Sanskrit and Hindu sciences, both religious and secular. ç
Hence they had adopted Sanskrit as the State language.
In the social fabric, the var<207>a-<193>·rama system had been deeply ç
rooted. The various sa<221>sk<193>ras (religio-social sacraments) ç
like marriage, were being done by the priests according to the Hindu ç
dharma-·<193>stras.
Though <185>aivism had been patronized by the State, Vai<218><207>avism ç
and Buddhism also flourished. Several Hindu temples including innumerable ç
images of <185>iva as also li<209>gas, have been discovered. However, ç
these temples are smaller in size and are built mostly in brick. In ç
architectural style they resemble the `rathas' of Mah<193>balipuram ç
or the temples of B<193>d<193>mi in Karnataka.
@NT = C<193>mu<207><195><193>
Mother worship and Mother cult are not alien to Vedic religion as ç
some suggest. The concept of Aditi (mother of gods and a personification ç
of nature) as also the Ambh<216><207><200>s<220>kta and the R<193>tris<220>kta ç
of the <184>gveda clearly contain the origins of the worship of ç
God as <185>akti or the Divine Mother.
One of the early basic texts of the <185>akti cult is the Dev<200>m<193>h<193>tmya ç
also called Durg<193>sapta·at<200> or Ca<207><195><200>. According ç
to this, K<193>l<200>, one of the aspects of Durg<193> that emanated ç
from her forehead, killed the two demons Ca<207><195>a and Mu<207><195>a, ç
gene-rals of the demon king <185>umbha, and got this name. She is ç
described as a fierce goddess, black in colour, emaciated and wearing ç
the cheetah skin as also severed human heads. Her mouth and tongue ç
were of immense proportions. She could kill troups of demons at one ç
stroke and could swallow several elephants in a gulp.
C<193>mu<207><195><193> is sometimes included inthe list of `Saptam<193>t<216>k<193>s' ç
or `Seven Mothers', in the place of N<193>rasi<221>h<200>.
She actually symbolizes the power of time in its all-destroying aspect.

From the Vedic days certain groups of people used to be kept outside ç
the paleof civilized society. `Asp<216>·yas' or `untouchables' was ç
the general name given to most of them since any kind of contact or ç
proximity with them was considered polluting. This was mostly due ç
to their horrendous ways of living and avocations fraught with potential ç
dangers to the general health of the society.

Manusm<216>ti 10.12). Other sm<216>tis define the word in other ç
ways.
The c<193><207><195><193>las were expected to live in their own colonies ç
outside the village or town. But they were given to roaming. Their ç
wealth was dogs and donkeys. They lived by cleaning the dirt of the ç
village or town. They ate the carcasses of dead animals and carried ç
corpses of persons who had no relatives, as also looked after the ç
cremation or burial grounds. They acted as executioners of people ç
sentenced to death by the king. They wore ornaments of lead, iron ç
or leather.
The c<193><207><195><193>las were perhaps the conquered aboriginal ç
tribes, dropouts from the society who never cared to follow its norms, ç
abominable sinners and those following dreadful occupations.

Candana is sandalwood (Santalum album) well-known for its fragrance ç
and medicinal properties. Indians knew its use even from very ancient ç
days.
It grows mostly in the Malayagiri (Western Ghats). Three varieties<192>white, ç
yellow  and  red<192>are  known  to  exist. Because of its fragrance ç
and cooling properties it is used as an item of luxury and also for ç
its curative effects. Its paste is one of the most important items ç
offered to a deity in ritualistic worship and is called `gandha'. ç
In some temples, on certain special days, the image of the deity is ç
decorated entirely with sandal paste.
@NT = Ca<207><195>e·vara
He is one of the attendant deities of <185>iva. According to the mythological ç
lore he was a br<193>hma<207>a boy, Vic<193>ra·arman by name, who ç
rose to that status by his intense devotion to <185>iva.
Iconographically, he is shown as a fierce deity, holding weapons of ç
war and destruction like the bow, arrow, trident, chisel, noose and ç
so on. Though independent shrines dedicated to him are not uncommon, ç
he is generally installed in every <185>iva temple in the north eastern ç
corner, facing south. Devotees believe that he can act as a mediator ç
interceding with the Lord on their behalf. Hence supplication before ç
him is a duty of every devotee visiting a <185>iva temple.
He is also known as Ca<207><195>i and Ca<207><195>e·a.
Ca<207><195>e·vara (14th cent. <MS>A.D.<D>) of Mithil<193> is a very ç
important compiler of digests on dharma·<193>stras. He was a minister ç
as well as the chief justice at the court of the king Harisi<221>hadeva ç
of Tirhut (now in Bihar). He belonged to the Kar<207><193>ta family. ç
Sm<216>tiratn<193>kara or Ratn<193>-kara is the extensive digest ç
compiled by him. Divided into seven sections†each containing the word ç

@N1 = (`recitation of the Ca<207><195><200>')
Recitation of stotras or hymns has long been accepted as a part of ç
the Hindu religious discipline. Its immense popularity can be gauged ç
from the fact that the Hindu hymnal literature extant today is as ç
vast as the sky and as deep as the ocean.
Some of these hymns like the Vi<218><207>u- sahasran<193>ma, the ç
Durg<193>sapta·at<200> (also known as Dev<200>m<193>h<193>tmya ç
and Ca<207><195><200>) and the Lalit<193>sahasran<193>ma have ç
acquired an esoteric significance, so much so, that they are considered ç
as `mantras' or mystic formulae. Consequently, ceremonial recitals ç
of these texts have also been prescribed, often for the fulfilment ç
of specific desires.
The Ca<207><195><200> or Durg<193>sapta·at<200> is a basic text ç
of the <185><193>kta cult or the cult of the Divine Mother. Its ceremonial ç
recital is called Ca<207><195><200>p<193><219>ha. The recital can ç
be done on any day or days, but the 8th, 9th and the 14th days of ç
the dark lunar fortnight have been specially recommended.
Since the ceremonial recital is equi-valent to worship, many preliminary ç
disciplines that apply to the latter, apply to the former also. For ç
instance: <193>camana (ceremonial sipping of water), pr<193><207><193>y<193>ma ç
(regulation of breath), sa<209>kalpa (religious resolve), d<200>pasth<193>pana ç
(establishing a lighted lamp as a witness) and so on. A regular worship ç
has to be offered to the book that is used for the recital. The recital ç
itself should be done audibly and clearly since that is believed to ç
create a wonderful atmosphere, in which the deity presents herself. ç
The main text is preceded by certain hymns like the Kavaca and followed ç
by others like the Rahasyatraya. A regular homa or havan is to be ç
done after the chanting is completed.
Normally one is expected to chant all the thirteen chapters†which ç
are divided into three books called Caritras†together at one sitting. ç
If this is not possible, alternative modes have also been recommended. ç
Details can be learnt from standard works on the subject or from the ç
adepts in the field.

are invariably for the good of the entire community or society or ç
country.

fruits, from the lowest secular ones to the highest spiritual enlightenment.

@NT = Candra
@N1 = (`one who delights or shines')
The deity who presides over the moon is called `Soma,' `Indu' or `Candra'. ç
The entire ninth ma<207><195>ala of the <184>gveda is devoted to ç
his praise. He is the presiding deity of the soma creeper, the juice ç
of which is often used in sacrifices as oblation and also partaken ç
by the participants. Sometimes identified with the Supreme God, he ç
is said to cure the mortals of their diseases and lead them to immortal ç
blissful worlds. He rules over the mind and activates our speech. ç
Hence he is sometimes called `V<193>caspati' or the `Lord of speech'.
The  Puru<218>as<220>kta  of  the  <184>gveda declares that Candra ç
was born out of the mind of the Supreme Being.
In the mythological literature, his birth is described variously as ç
the embodiment of the brilliant light that emerged from the eyes of ç
the sage Atri, as the son of Dharma-praj<193>pati or as rising out ç
of the ocean of milk when it was being churned. <185>iva wore him ç
as his diadem. The 27 constellations of stars like Rohi<207><200> ç
are described as his wives. His waxing and waning are due to a curse ç
he got from his father-in-law, Dak<218>a. His eclipse is due to his ç
being swallowed by the demon R<193>hu. He has special power over the ç
vegetation on this earth. He is full of am<216>ta or nectar. That ç
is why the gods drink him. He is replenished by the offerings in the ç
sacrifices. He is the originator of the Candrava<221>·a or the Lunar ç
dynasty of which <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a was the last member.
Works on Hindu Astrology consider him as one of the Navagrahas or ç
nine planets, with a beneficial influence.
Iconographically, he is represented with a face and two hands holding ç
lotuses, sitting in a chariot of two or three wheels and drawn by ç
ten horses.
In the works on Yoga and tantras, Candra is described as the `moon ç
of mystery,' full of nectar, existing just below the middle of the ç
sahasr<193>ra. By contemplating on him the yogi becomes fit to be ç
adored by the world.
Connection between the phases of the moon and the condition of mental ç
patients has long been recognized by the Hindu works on health and ç
sickness.

Once there was a dispute about Candra (moon) between <185>iva who ç
had worn him as his diadem and the nak<218>atras (constellations) ç
who were his wives. Brahm<193> mediated, divided Candra into two halves ç
and distributed them to the disputants. The place in the Him<193>layas ç
where this was done came to be known as `Candrabh<193>g<193>.' A river ç
arose at that spot and it was also christened `Candra-bh<193>g<193>.' ç
This is the story given in the Mah<193>bh<193>rata.
Actually the river rises in the Him<193>layas in two streams, one ç
being called Candr<193> and the other, Bh<193>g<193>. The two join ç
at Ta<207><195>i and the united stream is known as Candrabh<193>g<193>. ç
It is identified with the river Chenab now in Pakistan. It is called ç
`Asikn<200>' in the <184>gveda.
S<193>mba, the son of <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a, is said to have ç

Candrava<221>·a starts with Candra-Soma. His son was Budha from I<202><193>, ç

The dharma·<193>stras have described several kinds of pr<193>ya·cittas ç

is a universal expiation prescribed for almost any sin, especially ç
whereno other specific remedy has been suggested.
The name is derived from the fact thatin this expiation, the eating ç
pattern follows the phases of the moon. Starting with 15 morsels of ç
food (per day) on the full-moon, the same is gradually reduced by ç
one morsel every day, ending in total fasting on the new-moon day. ç
It is again increased, now from 1 to 15 morsels, till the full-moon ç
day. This is one cycle. It can be repeated as many times as desired ç
or needed. Since the quantity of food is full in the beginning and ç
end, becoming nil at the middle, it is called `pip<200>lik<193>madhya' ç
or `middle of an ant.'
If on the other hand, it is started with one morsel on the first day ç
after the new-moon, increasing to 15 morsels on the full-moon and ç
again reducing to nil on the new-moon, it is called `yavamadhya' or ç
`middle of the wheat grain.' The similes are self-explanatory. Size ç
of the morsel is that of a big myrobalan fruit.<M>

more well-known are the Candrik<193> of J<210><193>nottama and the ç
Candrik<193> of Vy<193>sat<200>rtha.
The former is a commentary on the Nai<218>karmya Siddhi of Sure·vara ç
(8th cent. <MS>A.D.<D>), a disciple of <185>a<209>kara, by one J<210><193>nottama, ç
who was probably a pontiff of the Advaita-ma<219>ha at K<193><210>c<200>puram, ç
and lived around <MS>A.D.<D> 1300.
The latter is actually an abbreviation for T<193>tparyacandrik<193>, ç
a commentary by Vy<193>sat<200>rtha (<MS>A.D.<D> 1447-1539) on the ç
Tattva- prak<193>·ik<193> of Jayat<200>rtha (14th cent. <MS>A.D.<D>), ç

@NT = C<193><209>gadeva
C<193><209>gadeva was a saint from Maha-rashtra who was a contemporary ç
of the famous Sant J<210><193>ne·var (13th cent. <MS>A.D.<D>). He ç
was a ha<219>hayogi with several miraculous powers and a host of disciples. ç
Having heardof the great fame of Sant J<210><193>ne·var he wanted ç
to humiliate him by making a show of his power. He once flew through ç
the air riding on a fierce tiger. J<210><193>ne·var who was then sitting ç
on a mud wall, along with his brother Sop<193>na and sister Mukt<193>-b<193><200>, ç
commanded the wall to fly and it did, carrying them all, much to the ç
chagrin of the ha<219>hayogi! C<193><209>gadeva surrendered. Atthe ç
instance of J<210><193>ne·var, his younger sister Mukt<193>b<193><200> ç
initiated C<193><209>gadeva into the mysteries of J<210><193>nayoga. ç
He became one of their most devoted disciples and has composed quite ç
a few abha<209>gas in which he has described some of his mystic experiences ç
got by their grace.
There is another C<193><209>gadeva who was a grandson of the great ç
mathematician Bh<193>skar<193>c<193>rya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1114-1160). ç
He was the chief astrologer under Si<209>ghana (a Y<193>dava king) ç
and founded a college for the studyof Siddh<193>nta-·iroma<207>i, ç

Caraka and Su·ruta are the two brightest stars in the firmament of ç
°yurveda or the Science of Life. Due to several reasons including ç
the destruction or plundering of valuable manuscripts by the various ç
hordes, invading this country, it is very difficult to know about ç
their period or original works.
The Hindu traditions which ascribe the origin of °yurveda to the creator ç
Brahm<193> himself mention about the sage °treya Punarvasu and his ç
brilliant disciple Agnive·a. Caraka is said to be the disciple of ç
Agnive·a. Since his name has been mentioned in the epic Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
some scholars assign him to the period 1400 <MS>B.C.<D> Others however ç
opine that Caraka was the court physician of K<193>ni<218>ka (3rd ç
cent. <MS>A.D.<D>), the Ku·<193>na king.
His work Carakasa<221>hit<193>, as it has come down to us today, ç
is undoubtedly a much revised edition. D<216><195>habala, a prominent ç
writer (of °yurveda), is said to have edited the earlier work and ç
added several sections since the original was incomplete. It consists ç
of eight prakara<207>as or sections divided into thirty chapters. ç
It is exclusively a book of medicine and not of surgery.
The contents of the eight prakara<207>as, very briefly, are as follows:
1.<+>S<220>trasth<193>na: origin of medicines; duties of the physician; ç
use of medicines; cure of diseases; materia medica; diet.
2.<+>Nid<193>nasth<193>na: curing of diseases like fever, tumours, ç
diabetes, leprosy, tuberculosis, manias and epilepsy.
3.<+>Vim<193>nasth<193>na: epidemics; nature of  food;  symptoms  and  diagnosis  of ç
diseases; use of medicines; peculiarities of the fluids of the body.
4.<+><185>ar<200>rasth<193>na: nature of the soul; conception; varieties ç
of species; qualities of elements; description of the body; connection ç
of body and the soul.
5.<+>Indriyasth<193>na: organs of senses and their diseases; loss ç
of strength and death.
6.<+>Cikits<193>sth<193>na: diseases like dropsy, swelling, piles, ç
jaundice, asthma, dysentery and effects of poisons; means of improving ç
health and enjoying long life.
7.<+>Kalpasth<193>na: emetics, purgatives, antidotes and medical ç
charms.
8.<+>Siddhisth<193>na: evacuating medi-cines,  injections,  abscesses  and  other ç
topics.
It is a remarkable work written in the camp<220> (mixture of prose ç
and poetry) style.Even mental illnesses and epidemic diseases have ç
been dealt with in detail. It has been translated into Persian and ç
Arabic languages in the 8th cent. <MS>A.<|>D.<D> There are 17 commentaries ç
on it in Sanskrit.

The cult of V<200>ra·aivism, with its philosophy of <185>akti-vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita, ç
took a definite shape during the middle ages in the province of Karnataka. ç
But it is rooted in the ancient schools of <185>aivism.
According to it, `Sthala' or the Absolute (equivalent of Brahman) ç
with its `<185>akti' or inherent power divides itself into `a<209>ga' ç
(the j<200>va) and `li<209>ga' (Para or Param<193>tman). `Carali<209>ga', ç
also called `ja<209>gamali<209>ga', is one of the aspects of this ç
li<209>ga. Since the human body is animated by Param<193>tman and ç
is capable of movement (cara or ja<209>gama = that which moves), it ç
is called `carali<209>ga' or `ja<209>gamali<209>ga'.

The practical, religious, aspect is called <185>r<200>vai<218><207>avism.
<185>r<200>vai<218><207>avism lays great emphasis on bhakti (devotion ç
to God) and prapatti (self-surrender) as the two parallel means of ç
attaining mok<218>a or liberation.
Prapatti depends upon receiving the rahasyatraya (`the three secrets') ç
from a qualified preceptor and practising the same.
They are: a<218><219><193>k<218>ar<200>mantra, dvaya-mantra and carama·loka. ç
(See <MS>A<186><187>°K<186>AR®<D> and <MS>DVAYAMANTRA<D> for details.)
The carama·loka is the 66th verse in the last chapter of the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> ç
(18.66). Though it is not the last in the section, since it contains ç

The word `cara<207>a' has been used in several senses like: foot, ç
a quarter of verse, pillar of a temple and part of a musical composition ç
(in Carnatic music).
In the Vedic terminology, it refers to a branch of the Veda (in a ç

not only the particular ·<193>kh<193> (the branch or recension of ç
Veda traditionally allotted to them for specialization) but also its ç

of this sect are generally  found  in  Delhi,  Haryana, western  Uttar  Pradesh  and  northern ç
Rajasthan.
He lived mostly in Alwar and taught devotion to K<216><218><207>a. ç
The eleventh book of the Bh<193>gavata was the basic text for his ç

@NT = C<193>rv<193>ka-dar·ana

Schools of Indian materialism, of various hues and shades, are generally ç
called C<193>rv<193>kadar·ana or Lok<193>yatamata. Whether there ç
was a real founder of this school by name C<193>rv<193>ka is difficult ç
to prove; probably not. The name of B<216>haspati, son of Loka, is ç
sometimes mentioned as the founder of this system.
The word `C<193>rv<193>ka' itself has been interpreted as `one who ç
speaks sweetly' (from c<193>ru = sweet, v<193>k = speech) or as one ç
who lives `to eat' (from carv = to eat or enjoy). The term `Lok<193>yata' ç
means `restricted to the world of common experience'. Both these names ç
refer to the nature of this system.
There are no extant basic texts of this school. Information has to ç
be gleaned from various other works which state these views sometimes ç
even quoting from their works, with the sole purpose of contradicting ç
and criticizing them.
@SPACE1 = 
The C<193>rv<193>ka system accepts pratyak<218>a or direct perception ç
as the only pram<193><207>a or valid source of knowledge, rejecting ç
even anum<193>na or inference. Consequently it admits of only four ç
elements†p<216>thv<200> (earth), ap (water), tejas (fire) and v<193>yu ç
(air)†as the fundamental substances  constituting  the  world.  It ç
denies the existence of God and soul. Consciousness, according to ç
it, is a chemical product of the combination of the elements that ç
make up the body. K<193>ma or pleasure here and now, is the only goal ç
of life. Artha or wealth is a means to it. One is advised to get the ç
maximum pleasure out of life, before it is too late. In this process ç
no attention need be paid to dharma, any moral or ethical scruples. ç
Mok<218>a or emancipation is a myth. Since death is the end of life ç
and there is no rebirth, life need not be `all labour' except for ç
what is necessary to get pleasure.
The C<193>rv<193>kas are sometimes classified into two groups: dh<220>rtas ç
or the crass ones and su·ik<218>itas or the cultured ones. The former ç
are base materialists interested only in the crude satisfaction of ç
beastly instincts. The latter as represented by V<193>tsy<193>yana ç
and others, accept dharma or righteousness also along with artha and ç
k<193>ma, and stress the need for self-control and discipline in life.
Whatever be their defect, the C<193>rv<193>kas have certainly forced ç
the later philosophers to give up dogmatism and spurred their free ç
thinking.

@NT = Caste System
@SB = Introduction
Though human beings come all alone into this world and return to the ç
Abode of their Father in Heaven, also alone, they cannot live alone ç
here! It is in their very nature to create a family or a group, to ç
live with. However, when their gregarious instinct makes their herds ç
grow into crowds, divisions into smaller groups become inevitable. ç
Various factors may contribute to thisdivision: professions, racial ç
features, beliefs and customs carried over from the ancient generations, ç
status consciousness brought about by economic well-being or higher ç
levels of education and culture, and so on.
People all over the world have been subjected to this phenomenon.
Nor have such groups, clans and tribes remained static and unaffected ç
by the vicissitudes of time and life. Terrific changes brought about ç
by variegated experiences, the impact of the different ways and values ç
of life of other groups, growth or deterioration of civilization and ç
culture or even unexpected upheavals from inside their own groups ç
have often wrought permanent transformations in them. Such groups ç
as were incapable of withstanding the shocks of changes, have either ç
been decimated or have been devoured and digested by the more aggressive ç
ones.
The one social system that has successfully withstood all the onslaughts ç
from without and within, over several millennia, is the caste system ç
of the Hindus. If similar systems that existed in Greece, Rome, Persia ç
or Japan have quietly disappeared into oblivion and only the Hindu ç
system has survived, it speaks volumes for not onlyits resilience ç
and tenacity, but also forits having fulfilled a great need and purpose ç
of the Hindu peoples. This point will be dealt with later.
It may not be irrelevant to mention here a notion that we normally ç
have†that the Semitic religions are monolithic and do not have any ç
social system that is comparable to the Hindu caste system. It is ç
true that†unlike the Hindu religion† they have only one founder and ç
one Book. But one will be surprised to know that there are numerous ç
varieties or schools of Christianity and that, in India at least, ç
there are several castes even among the Muslims!<|>*
@SB = Var<207>a, the Basis of the Caste System
The division of the Hindu society into four broad groups, known as ç
var<207>as is now a well-recognized fact.
Though the word `var<207>a' has been used in the sense of `colour' ç
of the skin, in the earlier sections of the <184>gveda wherein the ç
°ryans (fair in colour) and the Dasyus (of dark skin) have been divided ç
into two eternally warring groups, it soon lost this sense.
The fourfold var<207>a system goes back to the <184>gveda Sa<221>hit<193> ç
itself (vide 8.35.16.7; 1.10.8.7). To make a living by choosing ç
a profession as per one's desire and aptitude is a common phenomenon ç
seen in all civilized societies. It is the duty of the society to ç
provide suitable opportunities for its members to choose and pursue ç
those vocations that agree with their nature. This is the philosophy ç
behind the var<207>a system. The Vedas, including the Puru<218>as<220>kta ç
(wherein this fourfold division of the society has been enunciated ç
very clearly) have only recognized its existence and not created it.
@SPACE1 = 
As a society grows in size and civilization, there has got to be a ç
division of labour since all persons cannot do all things. In the ç
early Vedic period, this division of labour might have taken place ç
on a voluntary basis even as the members of a family do so on any ç
important occasion affecting the whole family. Some chose the occupation ç
of accumulating knowledge, wisdom and culture, and training the younger ç
generation in them. They became the br<193>hma<207>as. Those who were ç
physically sturdy and strong, took to arms to protect the society ç
from external aggression as also maintain internal law and order. ç
They were the k<218>attriyas. A great majority of the rest devoted ç
themselves to the production and distribution of wealth and goods ç
through agriculture, dairy-farming, trade and commerce. They were ç
called the vai·yas. The others who could not fit into any of these ç
vocations made a living by supplying manual labour and serving others. ç
They became the ·<220>dras. In course of time, each of these var<207>as†from ç
the br<193>hma<207>as to the ·<220>dras†acquired hierarchical superiority ç
over the succeeding ones.
Though this was a natural process based on gu<207>a (aptitude) and ç
karma (vocation chosen as per that aptitude), it was more a general ç
rule and an ideal one at that. It was almost impossible to estimate ç
the gu<207>a of every individual and assign an appropriate karma to ç
him. (What about a baby that is just born?) Hence birth in a var<207>a ç
became an easier and a more practicable principle to fix up the var<207>a ç
of that individual. This was the beginning of the j<193>ti system†now ç
called the `caste system'†wherein the var<207>a got automatically ç
fixed by birth (j<193>ti = birth).
Though the var<207>a of a person had been assigned to him by virtue ç
of his birth into it, there is enough evidence to surmise that one ç
had enough freedom to choose one's calling. Vi·v<193>mitra and V<200>tahavya ç
whowere k<218>attriya kings chose to become br<193>hma<207>a sages ç
by their Vedic learning and austerity. Para·ur<193>ma and Dro<207><193>-c<193>rya, ç
on the other hand, took to armsand fighting as their profession and ç
became† for all practical purposes†k<218>attriyas, retaining their ç
br<193>hma<207>ahood only in name. However, these conversions seem ç
to be rather an exception.
@SPACE = 
@SB = Growth of the Caste System
@SPACE = 
Human nature being prone to sense attraction and sex desire, the general ç
ruleof endogamy among the var<207>as was often violated. Hence anuloma ç
marriages† marriages of the men of the higher var<207>as with the ç
women of the lower ones†became common and had to be accorded legal ç
sanction. On the other hand, pratiloma marriages†the reverse of the ç
anuloma ones†could not be prevented, though frowned upon. This led ç
to what is technically known as `var<207>asa<209>kara' (mixing up ç
of the var<207>as or the castes) ultimately giving rise to a plethora ç
of mixed castes.
Even by the time of the great epic, the Mah<193>bh<193>rata (circa ç
3000 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>), the problem of var<207>asa<209>kara had become ç
stupendous. Incessant invasions from outside, by people of other races ç
and cultures like the Greeks, the H<220><207>as, the <185>akas, the ç
Scythians, the Persians and others who often settled down in India ç
and got integrated into the Hindu society, also contributed to the ç
multiplication of the castes.
@SPACE1 = 
While the law-givers, the authors of the sm<216>tis and dharma·<193>stras ç
(secondary scriptural works) were struggling to invent new names for ç
those innumerable castes, and even subcastes, the natural flow of ç
time and human history came to their rescue, at least in one way. ç
Increase of population and development of civilization necessitated ç
the manufacture of many new implements, instruments and devices for ç
greater comforts and smoother living. This led to a multiplication ç
of new professions, automatically absorbing more and more number of ç
persons into them. They became the new castes. That the nomenclatures ç
of many castes and subcastes contain a direct or indirect reference ç
to their professions is proof enough, of this development. Over the ç
decades or even centuries, a very high degree of specialization took ç
place in these skills and professions.
@SB = Positive Aspects of the Caste System
It has become a fashionable pastime for anyone who considers himself ç
as modern, to rail against the caste system. People are not wanting ç
who `discover' in it, the `sinister machinations' of the `cleverand ç
crooked' br<193>hma<207>as to keep a whole nation under slavish subjugation. ç
How a handful of people, who had neither military might nor the power ç
of wealth to back them up, could keep millions under their thumb for ç
millennia, except by the sheer power of their noble character and ç
a life dedicated to the welfare of all, does not seem to penetrate ç
their prejudiced brains. Impartial savants, whether from the West ç
or from the East, have showered encomiums on this system which has ç
survived many a brutal onslaught over the centuries. Sidney Low in ç
his Vision of India (2nd edn., 1907, pp. 262-263) eloquently praises ç
it thus:
@EMERGENCY = `There is no doubt that it is the main cause of the fundamental ç
stability and contentment by which Indian society has been braced ç
up for centuries against the shocks of politics and the cataclysms ç
of Nature. It provides every man with his place, his career, his occupation, ç
his circle of friends. It makes him at the outset a member of a corporate ç
body, it protects him through life from the canker of social jealousy ç
and unfulfilled aspirations; it ensures him companionship and a sense ç
of community with others in like case with himself. The caste organization ç
is to the Hindu his club, his trade union, his benefit society, his ç
philanthropic society. There are no workhouses in India and none are ç
as yet needed.'
This is what Abbe Dubois (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1770-1848), a Christian missionary ç
from France, who lived in close touch with the Indians of all castes ç
for over fifteen years, has to say on the same subject:
*`I consider the institution of castes among the Hindu nations as ç
the happiest effort of their legislation; and I am well convinced ç
that, if the people of India never sunk into a state of barbarism, ç
and if, when almost all Europe was plunged in that dreary gulf, India ç
kept up her head, preserved and extended the sciences, the arts and ç
civilization, it is wholly to the distinction of castes that she is ç
indebted for that high celebrity.'
Here is another quotation from Swami Vivekananda, the great prophet ç
of Modern India:
`We believe in Indian caste as one of the greatest social institutions ç
that the Lord gave to man. We also believe that though the unavoidable ç
defects, foreign persecutions, and above all, the monumental ignorance ç
and pride of many br<193>h-ma<207>as who do not deserve the name, ç
have thwarted in many ways, the legitimate fructification of this ç
most glorious Indian institution, it has already worked wonders for ç
the land of Bharata and is destined to lead Indian humanity to its ç
goal.'**

An unbiased study of the reasons for the survival of the caste system ç
can easily reveal its positive and constructive aspects thus:
(a)<+>It has given social security to every member of the caste by ç
instilling a sense of belonging even from his early childhood days.
(b)<+>It has, in an easy and natural way, given excellent training ç
in the parti-cular trade or profession, since the whole family is ç
engaged in it. Most often, since people of the same caste, practising ç
a particular profession, lived in colonies of their own, the very ç
atmosphere was congenial to this training. This has automatically ç
eliminated the problem of unemployment which has assumed alarming ç
proportions now.
(c)<+>It has abolished unhealthy and cut-throat competition in the ç
trade due tothe cooperative efforts of the entire community.

@SB = Gradual Decadence of the Caste System
@SPACE1 = 
There is no gainsaying the fact that during the last 150 years, there ç
has been a gradual decline of the true spirit behind the caste system. ç
It has been much more pronounced during the 50 years after ourpolitical ç
independence. These may be listed as follows:
(a)<+>Men decay where wealth accumulates. Concentration of power leads ç
to corruption.  The  br<193>hma<207>as  and  the k<218>attriyas, developed ç
vested interests in their position, status and power, which had helped ç
them to better their worldly prospects. Instead of striving to serve ç
the society through these, they tried to subju-gate it for selfish ç
ends. It naturally produced reactions and caste conflicts. In fact, ç
these conflicts have spread even to the so-called lower castes, each ç
of which trying to establish its `superiority' over the others.
(b)<+>Forgetting their duties and obligations to the society as a whole, ç
people have started asserting their rights and privileges and fighting ç
for them. This has led to the disturbance of the equilibrium and peace ç
of the social structure.
(c)<+>The import of science and techno-logy from the West, with its ç
concomitants of less work, more leisure and greater material comforts, ç
has had a devastating effect on the Indian society. The need-based ç
pattern of life has yielded its place to a greed-based one, thus sowing ç
unrest in all fields of life.
(d)<+>As a result, all sections of the society including the br<193>hma<207>as†the ç
original custodians of religion, ethical and spiritual values†have ç
forsaken their great and time-tested ideals and have fallen a prey ç
to the sensate culture of the machine- made civilization, of the West.
@SPACE1 = 
Before taking up a study of the remedial measures, it is better to ç
turnour attention to the original Br<193>hma<207>a Ideal, to which ç
everybody in the society was expected to be raised, in course of time.
@SPACE = 
@SB = The Br<193>hma<207>a Ideal
@SPACE = 
The strength and stamina of any society depends not so much on its ç
physical vigour and vitality or its economic power as on the general ç
personal character of the individuals it comprises. People who are ç
endowed with a will that inspires them, `to strive, to seek, to find, ç
and not to yield,' are the real wealth of a nation. Such a high degree ç
of evolution cannot be achieved in a day. It may take decades, nay, ç
even centuries to do so. And, this needs highly evolved, ideal, persons ç
who become the models for others to emulate. Not only that, they should ç
actively train and guide the rest of the society by their work, example ç
and precept.
It is exactly this that the ancient sages of India, the founding fathers ç
of Vedic  religion  and  philosophy,  did, whenthey gave us the var<207>a ç
system with the br<193>hma<207>a ideal as its pinnacle of glory.
A br<193>hma<207>a was, first of all, to be a `brahmavid,' a knower ç
of Brahman, a knower of God. Since `Brahman' or the Vedas (which taught ç
the science of the Spirit), was the means to it, a br<193>hma<207>a ç
was commanded to master it and then spread its wisdom to the worthy ç
disciples that may approach him for the same.
A life of the spirit leads to the life in the Spirit, called Brahman. ç
This means, maximizing the intellectual, moral and spiritual (or soul) ç
powers through tapas or austerity, enabling one to ultimately reach ç
that goal. Since the physical body, the sense-organs and an unripe ç
mind as also a wild ego are capable of knocking down even highly evolved ç
spiritual aspirants, the br<193>hma<207>a is urged to spare no efforts ç
in chastising and subjugating them. Thus a br<193>hma<207>a has to ç
wage a relentless war on two fronts simultaneously†to control the ç
physical instincts and to raise the mind to higher levels.
In every country, a soldier who is prepared to lay down his life in ç
defending it, is given certain prerogatives and privileges; and, rightly ç
so. Then, why not accord the same to these noble souls who have willingly ç
forsaken their personal comforts and luxuries for the sake of an ideal ç
that ultimately helps the entire society? Recog-nizing this, the sm<216>tis ç
and the dharma-·<193>stras (scriptures considered as next in importance ç
to the Vedas and guiding the lives of people in all its aspects) have ç
given some rights and privileges to the br<193>hma<207>a.
A br<193>hma<207>a is primarily expected to study the Vedas, teach ç
it to others competent to acquire its knowledge and lead a contemplative ç
life. He may be an expert in several branches of sciences and arts ç
and train others in them without expecting any fee for the same. He ç
may, if he chooses, act as a priest in sacrifices conducted by others ç
or perform them himself. On such occasions he is free to accept gifts ç
and also bestow them on others.
@SPACE1 = 
He is not normally expected to practise remunerative professions except ç
in times of great distress. Hence it is the duty of the society†especially ç
the k<218>attriya kings and the well-to-do vai·yas†to maintain him, ç
as also his family and disciples, if he is running a gurukula (forest ç
academy). The king should not collect taxes from him and should exempt ç
him from the general laws of the land. Punishment for transgressions, ç
if any, must be very mild. On all occasions in general and during ç
religious festivals in particular, the br<193>hma<207>a should get ç
precedence over others and a place of honour and veneration.
@SPACE = 
@SB = The Br<193>hma<207>a in Actual Life
@SPACE = 
From the foregoing description it should not be surmised that the ç
br<193>hma<207>a was above the laws of the land and hencea law unto ç
himself! His own pure conscience being the best judge, the br<193>hma<207>a ç
often applied the rules to himself even more ruthlessly than he wished ç
for the others. The story of <185>a<209>kha and Likhita (vide Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
<185><193>ntiparva, ch. 23), is a case to the point.
Human nature being rather fragile, easily subject to the weaknesses ç
of the flesh and lucre, not all the br<193>hma<207>as could keep to ç
the superhuman ideals expected of them. As they gradually slided down ç
from the lofty ideals, they took to other means of living as were ç
prescribed for the k<218>attriyas and vai·yas, like fighting, agriculture, ç
trade and commerce. As long as they sincerely struggled to keep up ç
the Vedic studies and also lead a simple and austere life, the sm<216>tis ç
and dharma-·<193>stras (of later periods) permitted them to do so.
During further periods of decline of their br<193>hma<207>ahood, they ç
advocated the theory of the superiority of a br<193>hma<207>a just ç
by birth and started claiming the privileges as of old, as a matter ç
of right.*
This had a twofold deleterious effect: They contributed to their own ç
spiritual damnation. They also generated unhealthy reactions from ç
the other members of the society. Gradually they lost their privileges. ç
They were forced to obey the general laws of the land as others.
Since the br<193>hma<207>as were the trend-setters for the society†it ç
being universally conceded that they represented the Ideal Man†their ç
forsaking the spiritual ideals of human excellence, had a catastrophic ç
effect on the whole society. If today the Hindu society in general ç
is sunk in the quagmire of corruption, nepotism and immorality, much ç
of the blame should be apportioned to the br<193>hma<207>as themselves.
@SPACE = 
@SB = The <185><220>dra Problem
If in the original var<207>a system, the br<193>hma<207>a stood at ç
the top of the ladder of social hierarchy, the ·<220>dra occupied ç
the bottom rung.
Who exactly the ·<220>dras were, has been a point of discussion and ç
debate among scholars, especially the sociologists and the anthropologists. ç
As per the original var<207>a system, the ·<220>dras were very much ç
a part and parcel of the °ryan society.  Though  they  earned  their ç
livelihood by physical labour and service to the other three var<207>as ç
they did enjoy social status and honour. In the early Vedic society ç
rules about inter-dining and inter-marriage do not seem to have been ç
very  stringent.  The  br<193>hma<207>as  could employ the ·<220>dras ç
as cooks (vide °pastamba Dharmas<220>tras, 2.2.3.4) and could ç
accept their invitation for dinner if they were their own servants ç
or tillers of their land or even their family friends (vide Gautama ç
Dharmas<220>tras 17.1 and 6). Some authorities like B<193>dari even ç
allowed them to establish Vedic fires or have the sa<221>sk<193>ras ç
(religious sacraments) performed.
From all these we can perhaps conclude that except for keeping the ç
Vedic fires and studying or teaching the Vedas, they were allowed ç
to live a decent life like any other member of the °ryan society. ç
And, they were certainly entitled to the acquisition of spiritual ç
knowledge and wisdom, though not through the Vedas, but through the ç
secondary works like the itih<193>sas and the pur<193><207>as.
@SPACE1 = 
However, things did change for the worse, for the ·<220>dras as time ç
rolled by. Their freedom got gradually curtailed. Their social disabilities ç
were multiplied. Their honour and dignity were lowered. Some sections ç
from among them were even branded as untouchables, segregated from ç
the general society and forced to live outside the towns and villages. ç
Punishments for transgressions against the higher var<207>as became ç
more and more severe.  Legal  protection  became  less effective.
The gradual decline of the ·<220>dras in the hierarchy of the °ryan ç
society might have been due to several causes:
As the general population increased, that of the ·<220>dras also naturally ç
swelled. An unconscious fear of their numerical strength might have ç
induced the upper classes of the society to impose greater restrictions ç
on them.
Offsprings of the anuloma and prati-loma marriages along with those ç
of clandestine unions as also the parents of the latter, were relegated ç
to the ·<220>dra class. Persons of the upper var<207>as guilty of ç
heinous sins, were also pushed down into the ·<220>dra class. They ç
being renegades, the br<193>hma<207>as were perhaps unwilling to give ç
them the facilities that the ·<220>dras enjoyed earlier.
Invading tribes of foreign origin whenthey decided to stay on in ç
India and get domiciled, could neither be ignored nor assimilated ç
completely. Hence they might have grudgingly been given a place among ç
the ·<220>dras. Since they were totally alien to the local religion ç
and culture, restrictions had to be placed on them to protect the ç
°ryan way of life from being adversely affected.
@SPACE1 = 
@SB = Untouchability
@SPACE1 = 
Along with the decline of the ·<220>dras there appeared in the Hindu ç
society, an evil practice worse than the ones known so far†that of ç
asp<216>·yat<193> or untouchability. Neither during the Vedic period, ç
nor during the period of the early dharma-·<193>stras, was untouchability ç
mentioned, much less practised. Even the c<193><207><195><193>las, ç
considered the lowest in the social rank, were counted only among ç
the ·<220>dras.
How and when exactly the practice began, it is difficult to say. Ceremonial ç
impurity as on the birth or death in a family was fairly well-known. ç
Contact with unclean objects or persons made a person `asp<216>·ya' ç
or untouchable, but a bath could remedy the defect.
@SPACE1 = 
Gradually, the notion must have gained ground that certain persons ç
constantly engaged in very unclean occupations like cleaning human ç
ordure, butchery and sale of meat, tanning and so on† which were a ç
health hazard for others† had to be segregated and treated as untouchables ç
in the best interest of the society as a whole. Hence they were made ç
to live outside the towns and villages andtheir entry and movements ç
were restricted.* What might have begun thus was, unfortunately, extended ç
to all the persons of those castes later on, even though they might ç
have been engaged in more decent occupations.
That untouchability is a blot on the Hindu society has been conceded ç
by one and all. Vigorous efforts have been made by the teachers of ç
the Bhakti Schools like <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a Caitanya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1485-1533) earlier and by N<193>r<193>ya<207>a Guru (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1854-1928) andMah<193>tm<193> G<193>ndh<200> (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1869-1948) ç
in recent history, to eliminate it and restore a place of dignity ç
to these unfortunate persons.

@SB = Solution to the Caste Problem in<R>ç
Modern India
@SPACE = 
In spite of all the encomiums heaped upon the Caste System by a few ç
far-sighted savants of the East and the West, it is an undeniable ç
fact that serious situations are, off and on, arising out of it (as ç
it obtains now), sometimes creating law and order problems too! The ç
caste consciousness has become so deep-rooted in the psyche of our ç
people that even among the so-called untouchable classes, some sections ç
are claiming `superiority' over other sections! The problem has further ç
been compounded by selfish and narrow-minded political and social ç
leaders, ever eager to fish in troubled waters. Various laws enacted ç
by the governments†whether at the Centre or in the States†though done ç
with the best of intentions, have not had the desired impact on the ç
society.
One of the solutions that is often `graciously' given by many a leader ç
in social life is that the system itself should be scrapped. It is ç
akin to advising the abolition of all the political systems since ç
none hasreally helped humanity perfectly. (Or, why not cut off the ç
head, to get rid of headaches?!)
In fact some of the religious leaders of the medieval ages (of India) ç
who tried this method, not only failed in their efforts, but ultimately ç
ended up in adding one more caste along with many subcastes to the ç
already existing ones!
Even in countries that have no caste system as we have in India, social ç
tensions and violent conflicts have not disappeared. Racial riots, ç
sectarian violence and even religious conflicts among people professing ç
the same religion are the order of the day.
Hence the solution of abolishing the caste system itself is worse ç
than the problem it is supposed to solve.
@SPACE1 = 
Wisdom lies in a reappraisal of the entire system over the centuries, ç
discover the various loopholes and plug them, and also improve the ç
system itself in other ways so that we can get the best out of it. ç
Let us not forget that it has successfully worked for over five millennia ç
or even more!
The causes of all conflicts among the human beings, including those ç
rooted in caste-consciousness,  are  basically  two: selfishness and ç
egoism. If and when one caste group succeeds in getting better off ç
in life, both economically and culturally, it also succeeds in rousing ç
the wrath of other caste groups that may be lagging behind. False ç
pride and hurt-feelings roused by the progress of other castes may ç
also be responsible for initiating friction, tensions and conflicts.
The best and the only remedy for this is good education for all ç
the people of our country. Education can be the panacea for many an ç
evil in our society. However, this education, apart from giving general ç
knowledge and proficiency in some calling, should also give a person ç
refinement and culture through the imparting of moral, ethical and ç
spiritual values. In other words dharma, in its true sense, must become ç
an integral part of an education system. If and when such an education ç
makes all the people feel that they are one people belonging to a ç
great country and are endowed with tremendous potentialities to raise ç
themselves from the brute level to the human level, and ultimately ç
to the divine level, they will become an invaluable asset to the whole ç
of humanity. In fact, it was exactly this ideal that our ancient sages ç
envisaged when they attempted to raise everyone ultimately to the ç
level of the ideal br<193>hma<207>a, through their propagation of ç
the var<207>a system and eulogy of the true br<193>hma<207>a. And, ç
many of these great ones like Vy<193>sa, V<193>lm<200>ki or Vasi<218><219>ha, ç
were themselves not br<193>hma<207>as by birth!
Most unfortunately, during the last few decades, a virulent and systematic ç
propaganda has been mounted by certain non-br<193>hma<207>a leaders ç
against the br<193>hma<207>as, blaming them for all the ills that ç
have afflicted their own societies. It is best to quote in reply, ç
Swami Vivekananda (who himself was not a br<193>hma<207>a by caste) ç
here:
*`Therefore, it is no use fighting among the castes...It will divide ç
us all the more, weaken us all the more, degrade us all the more. ç
The solution is not by bringing down the higher, but by raising the ç
lower upto the level of the higher. And that is the line of work found ç
in all our books...The ideal at one end is the br<193>hma<207>a and ç
the ideal at the other end is the c<193><207><195><193>la, and the ç
whole work is to raise the c<193><207><195><193>la upto the br<193>hma<207>a. ç
Slowly and slowly you find more and more privileges granted to them.
`It is true that he (the br<193>hma<207>a) was the earliest preacher ç
to the Indian races, he was the first to renounce everything in order ç
to attain the higher realization of life, before others could reach ç
to the idea. It was not his fault that he marched ahead of the other ç
castes. Why did not the other castes so understand and do as they ç
did? Why did they sit down and be lazy, and let the br<193>hma<207>as ç
win the race?
`To the non-br<193>hma<207>a castes I say, wait, be not in a hurry. ç
Do not seize every opportunity of fighting the br<193>hma<207>a, because ç
as I have shown, you are suffering from your own fault. Who told you ç
to neglect spirituality and Sanskrit learning? What have you been ç
doing all this time?...Why do you not spend millions to bring Sanskrit ç
education to all the castes of India? ...The moment you do these things ç
you are equal to the br<193>hma<207>a. That is the secret power of ç
India.'
Vivekananda, during his days, vigorously advocated the study of Sanskrit ç
by all, because according to him, Sanskrit education brought with ç
it refinement and culture, by opening up the entire treasure for our ç
ancient religio-cultural literature.
@SPACE1 = 
Another problem which is intimately connected with caste conflicts ç
is that of inter-dining and inter-marriage among the castes. Though ç
inter-dining in urban India seems to have become common, it is still ç
a taboo in the rural areas. As for inter- caste marriages it is not ç
at all common even in the urban areas.
@EMERGENCY = In the rural areas it is not only frowned upon even now ç
but has often led to violent conflicts. With all the propaganda in ç
favour of inter-caste marriages by the government media, people in ç
general are yet to accept the concept. Attitudes among the common ç
people have hardened to such an extent that inter-marriages even among ç
the sub-groups of the same caste are not favoured. It being a rather ç
sensitive issue, one has to tread very slowly and carefully. As Vivekananda ç
avers*, the unity moves should begin at the levels of subcastes and ç
subgroups, gradually integrating them into the main var<207>as, thus ç
restoring the original four var<207>a system. At the same time the ç
notion of privileges should be given the go-byand the duties of everyone ç
towards the society as a whole must be stressed. Of course, the right ç
type of education imparted from the young age can achieve this in ç
course of time.
If the br<193>hma<207>as show the way, by returning to a life of `simple ç
living and high thinking,' by producing from among themselves  great  persons  of  sterling ç
character, the balance in the society also can be restored more easily ç
and quickly.

An example can make this point clear. Suppose in a family, the last ç
child has been handicapped; will its elder brothers and sisters throw ç
it into the well thinking it is a useless child and a burden upon ç
them? On the other hand, they will lavish extra love and affection ç
on it, to bring it up and make it happy. In exactly the same way, ç
if the forward sections of the society†those who are economically, ç
educationally and culturally forward†take some extra trouble for the ç
upliftment of the weaker sections, not only will the latter be happy ç

The Hindu scriptures, by and large, have given a very high status ç
to the king, even calling him as `pratyak<218>a-devat<193>' (`visible ç
deity'). It was his primary duty and responsibility to protect the ç
lives, properties, honour and religion of his subjects at any cost. ç
Whatever he did for discharging this, was considered dharma or righteousness, ç
as long as he had no selfish or impure motives.
For this, he was advised to employ four kinds of `up<193>yas' or means ç
which were technically called `gu<207>as.' They are: s<193>ma  (conciliation),  d<193>na  (concessions, ç
favours and gifts), bheda (dissensions) and da<207><195>a (conflict ç
and war).
The enemies of the State could be internal or external, the former ç
being considered as the more dangerous. The king was advised to make ç
use of the da<207><195>op<193>ya as the last resort. He was to try ç
for conciliation through sweet words, concessions, favours and gifts. ç
If these did not have the desired effect, then he should secretly ç
try to bring about dissensions among the enemies and trouble-makers ç
through spies of proven loyalty. Da<207><195>a or war was to be the ç
last resort.
Both Manu and Kau<219>ilya have dealt with this subject in detail.

Certain Vedic sacrifices belonging to the `i<218><219>i' group (See ç

sacrifices have to be repeated every four months. They are: Vai·vadeva, ç
Varu<207>apragh<193>sa, S<193>kamedha and <185>un<193>s<200>r<200>ya. ç
(See under the respective titles for details.) Each is called a `parvan' ç
or a part of the C<193>turm<193>syas. They were performed respectively ç
on the full-moon days of Ph<193>lguna or Caitra (February<192> April), ç
°<218><193><195>ha (July), K<193>rttika (November) and on the fifth ç
full-moon from the day on which the S<193>kamedha is performed. Obviously ç
these are the beginnings of the spring, monsoon and autumn seasons. ç
The Maruts were the most prominent deities receiving offerings in ç
all of them with the set of gods peculiar to each. The attainment ç
of heaven was the promised fruit. These sacrifices could be performed ç
either throughout one's life or for one year only.
The four months of the rainy season are also called `c<193>turm<193>sya'. ç
A `vrata' or a religious observance, has been prescribed for these ç
months for those who are interested, by the sm<216>tis and dharma-·<193>stras. ç
It begins with a sa<209>kalpa or resolve on the 11th or the 12th day ç
of the bright half of °<218><193><195>ha (July), or on the full-moon ç
day. During these four months, the person under the vow, should desist ç
from consuming some specified edibles like vegetables, curds and milk, ç
and give up some luxuries such as cot. It is to be concluded on the ç
Utth<193>na-dv<193>da·<200> day (12th day of the bright half of K<193>rttika ç
which generally comes in November). Many rewards, both here and hereafter, ç
have been promised to those that observe this vrata. It is open to ç
women also.
The sa<221>ny<193>sins (monks) also have a c<193>turm<193>sya. During ç
the days when the sa<221>ny<193>sins were mendicants, realizing the ç
difficulty of moving about during the rainy season, it was made obligatory ç
for them to spend the four or even two months of the rainy season ç
by camping in a suitable place. Their vrata or vow begins on the Vy<193>sa-p<220>r<207>im<193> ç
(full-moon day in °<218><193><195>ha), with a ceremonial worship of ç
God, the sage Vedavy<193>sa and one's gurus (preceptors). (Hence the ç
day is also called `Guru-p<220>r<207>im<193>'.) During these days ç
they can live in the congenial company of other monks, study the scriptures, ç
practise their personal spiritual disciplines and also preach to the ç
householder devotees that may approach them.

In Indian mythological accounts, Brahm<193> the Creator, is called ç
`Caturmukha' since he has four faces, representing the four Vedas. ç
See <MS>BRAHM°<D> for details.

While dealing with other kings who may cause trouble to himself, either ç
now or in future, a wise ruler should adopt the caturop<193>yas or ç
four means judiciously. They are: s<193>ma (reconciliation); d<193>na ç
(yielding something to appease him); bheda (bringing about a split ç
in the enemy's ranks) and da<207><195>a (going to war).

Honouring the dead ancestors through appropriate rituals is a pheno-menon ç
common to many cultures. Such a ceremony among the Hindus is called ç
`·r<193>ddha'. Riceballs called `pi<207><195>as' are offered to the ç
ancestors with suitable mantras during these ceremonies.
In one of these ·r<193>ddhas called `p<193>rva<207>a·r<193>ddha,' ç
the offerings are made to the dead ancestors up to three generations ç
(father, grandfather and great-grandfather) only, omitting the fourth ç
and beyond (visarga = omitting). This is called `caturthavisarga'.
