@NT = J<193>b<193>la Upani<218>ad
@SPACE = 
One of the well-known minor Upani<218>ads assigned to the Atharvaveda ç
(or the <185>ukla Yajurveda according to some), the J<193>b<193>la ç
Upani<218>ad is in prose and deals mainly with the subject of renunciation ç
and monasticism. It is, practically, the only Upani<218>ad that allows ç
a person to take tothe life of sa<221>ny<193>sa even from the first ç
or the second stage of life (i.e., from the brahmacarya <193>·rama ç
or the g<216>hastha <193>·rama), the sole criterion being intense ç
renunciation.
There are six kha<207><195>as or sections,<|>each containing one long ç
passage in prose. Some versions divide these passages into smaller ç
units, the total number being twelve.
The Upani<218>ad starts with a short dialogue between B<216>haspati ç
and Y<193>j<210>a- valkya. B<216>haspati extols the greatness of Avimuktak<218>etra ç
(i.e., K<193>·<200> or V<193>r<193><207>as<200>, the modern Banaras ç
in Uttar Pradesh) calling it as Kuruk<218>etra also. Its greatness ç
is mainly due to the fact that Rudra (<185>iva) teaches the `t<193>rakamantra' ç
(R<193>man<193>ma) to all the j<200>vas who give up their bodies there.
In the next section, in reply to the question raised by the sage Atri, ç
Y<193>j<210>a- valkya teaches the method of up<193>san<193> or meditation ç
on the avimukta (the Self) established between vara<207><193> and ç
n<193>·<200> (i.e., in between the eyebrows and above the nose). This ç
point is the meeting place of the world of gods and the world beyond.
Then, while answering the questions raised by some brahmac<193>rins ç
or Vedic students, Y<193>j<210>avalkya eulogises the <185>atarudriya†same ç
as the Rudr<193>dhy<193>ya of the K<216><218><207>a Yajurveda†and ç
advises them to meditate on it, as also the names and the forms of ç
Rudra described by it.
Janaka,  the  king  of  Videha, approaches Y<193>j<210>avalkya and ç
requests him to teach about sa<221>ny<193>sa or the life of renunciation. ç
After first describing how a person has to take to the next <193>·rama ç
or stage of life, completing the previous one, Y<193>j<210>avalkya ç
declares that one can take to the life of sa<221>ny<193>sa directly ç
even from the earlier stages like brahmacarya or g<193>rhasthya, provided ç
there is intense vair<193>gya or spirit of renunciation.
@EMERGEN1 = This is followed by some details of the process of taking ç
sa<221>ny<193>sa which include the ceremonial abandonment of the Vedic ç
fire and repetition of the Pra<207>ava or Om.
In the next section, in reply to a question by the sage Atri, Y<193>j<210>avalkya ç
replies that a sa<221>ny<193>sin need not wear the yaj<210>opav<200>ta ç
(the sacred thread) since he purifies himself by <193>camana (ceremonial ç
sipping of water with appropriate mantras) which is a part of the ç
procedure for taking sa<221>ny<193>sa.
@EMERGEN1 = It is interesting to note that the Upani<218>ad permits ç
religious suicide for one who is disgusted with worldly life, but ç
is unfit or unable to take sa<221>ny<193>sa. This can take the form ç
of drowning in water or entering into a blazing fire or even dying ç
on the battle field.
Taking sa<221>ny<193>sa mentally has also been permitted for those ç
who are physically unfit for formal sa<221>ny<193>sa.
The last section describes the life- pattern of paramaha<221>sas, ç
the paragons of the monastic ideal, like Sa<221>vartaka, °ru<207>i, ç
<185>vetaketu, Durv<193>sa, <184>bhu, Datt<193>treya, Ja<195>abharata ç
and others.
Since they are paramaha<221>sas (monks of the highest order), they ç
do not carry any external insignia of sa<221>ny<193>sa with them. ç
They move about freely, begging for alms when hungry and live in deserted ç
places like empty and forsaken houses, river-banks, hills, caves and ç
so on. They are ever devoted to the <193>tman inside and give up their ç
bodies without the least attachment to them.

@NT = J<193>b<193>li
@SPACE = 
According to the Mah<193>bh<193>rata he was one of the sons of the ç
sage Vi·v<193>mitra but was more closely associated with the sage ç
Vasi<218><219>ha.
In the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a (Ayodhy<193>k<193><207><195>a 106) ç
J<193>b<193>li has been described as one of the eight priests of the ç
king Da·aratha. When R<193>ma went to the forest, he accompanied Bharata, ç
along with Vasi<218><219>ha, to try to bring him back. As Bharata's ç
entreaties to R<193>ma fell on deaf ears, J<193>b<193>li intervened. ç
He tried to advise R<193>ma taking an extremely materialistic view. ç
Since Da·aratha was an old man lustful by nature, and since he was ç
dead now, there was no need to take his words (or command) seriously! ç
One need not bother much about the next world but enjoy the good things ç
of life here and now, and so on!
Of course, he was interested in somehow bringing back R<193>ma to ç
Ayodhy<193> and was not really an atheist or agnostic.
@NT = J<193>b<193>li Upani<218>ad
This is a short, minor, Upani<218>ad belonging to the S<193>maveda ç
and is classed among the <185>aiva Upani<218>ads.
It is in the form of a dialogue between the sages Paippal<193>di and ç
J<193>b<193>li. It contains 23 mantras, all in prose.
The questions asked concern four topics: j<200>va, pa·u, ®·a and the ç
means of mok<218>a.
J<193>b<193>li, the teacher got the knowledge about them from <186>a<195><193>nana ç
(the six faced Subrahma<207>ya) who in turn, got it from his father ç
®·<193>na (®·vara or <185>iva) by worshipping him.
®·vara is Pa·upati (literally, `the lord of animals or living beings'). ç
Somehow, due to the association with aha<209>k<193>ra or egoism, he ç
himself becomes the pa·us (the animals or the bound souls).
The j<200>vas or the individual souls†like animals†lack discrimination ç
and are driven to do things by others. Hence they are called pa·us. ç
Being the lord of these j<200>vas and all-knowing, ®·vara has been ç
called `Pa·upati'.
How does one get the knowledge of that ®·a? By wearing the bhasma ç
or holyash at the appropriate places like the head, the forehead, ç
chest and so on, using the pa<210>ca-brahma-mantras (mantras containing ç
the names of the five aspects of <185>iva or ®·vara, viz., Sadyoj<193>ta, ç
V<193>madeva, Aghora, Tatpuru<218>a, and ®·<193>na). Drawing the three ç
lines (tripu<207><195>ra) is called `·<193>mbhavavrata'.
This is then followed by what these three lines represent. They stand ç
for: the three Vedic fires, the three worlds, the three extractions ç
of the soma juice and the three syllables of O<209>k<193>ra (a, u, ç
andm).
The Upani<218>ad concludes with the eulogy that one who wears the ç
three lines of vibh<220>ti or bhasma will be liberated from all sins. ç
He is as good as having studied the Vedas, as good as having perfect ç
meditation, as good as having bathed in all the sacred rivers and ç
as good as having repeated all the mantras of God Rudra.
And, he will not return to mundane existence again.

@NT = Ja<195>abharata
Many a Hindu scripture declares that great saints often camouflage ç
themselves as dull or eccentric persons, to avoid being harassed by ç
self-seeking followers. One such great saint was Ja<195>abharata, ç
`Bharata, the Dull'.
Bharata, the son of <184><218>abhadeva and Jayant<200>, was a great ç
emperor whose extraordinary rule got this land of India, the name ç
`Bharatavar<218>a' or `Bh<193>rata'. In his old-age he entrusted his ç
empire to his sons and retired to the forest for tapas. One day while ç
taking his bath in the river, he chanced to come across a pregnant ç
deer which gave birth to a cub and died. He brought the deer-cub to ç
his hermitage and started rearing it. He was so much attached to it ç
that even at the time of his death,his mind was brooding over it. ç
As a result, he was reborn as a deer. After death he was born again ç
as the son of a saintly br<193>hma<207>a. Though full of spiritual ç
wisdom, he used to roam about like a ja<195>a or a dullard and thus ç
he was nicknamed `Ja<195>abharata'.
Once he was taken captive by the soldiers of a king, V<216><218>ala ç
by name, who tried to sacrifice him to K<193>l<200> in a forest temple. ç
However, the fierce goddess manifested herself and killed all of them, ç
saving Ja<195>abharata's life.
At  another  time,  the  palanquin- bearers of the king Rah<220>ga<207>a ç
forcibly employed him as one of the bearers. When his uneven ways ç
of walking started rocking the palanquin, the king got annoyed and ç
scolded him. But his reply couched in highly Ved<193>ntic terms, surprised ç
the king who begged for pardon. He requested the sage to teach him ç
spiritual wisdom.

@N1 = (<MS>A.<|>D.<D><|>1728-1809)<R>ç
(`servant of the Lord of the world')<MS>
The Harid<193>sas (`servants of God') of Karnataka have carved for ç
themselves an important place in the Bhakti Movement that helped the ç
rejuvenation of Hinduism in medieval India. The four, most important, ç
of these are: Purandarad<193>sa, Vijaya-d<193>sa, Gop<193>lad<193>sa ç
and Jagann<193>thad<193>sa.
His original name was <185>r<200>niv<193>s<193>-c<193>rya. Though ç
born in a small village called By<193>gava<219><219>e near M<193>navi ç
in the Raichur district of Karnataka, he lived most of the time in ç
the latter place. His house has now been converted into his shrine.
<185>r<200>niv<193>s<193>c<193>rya was a born genius in composing ç
poems in Sanskrit. In course of time he acquired astounding scholarship ç
in the scriptures, especially of the dvaita school of Madhv<193>c<193>rya ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1197-1276). Arrogance of scholarship made him slight ç
Vijayad<193>sa (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1682-1755) as a result of which he contacted ç
a severe disease of the stomach. By divine intervention he was directed ç
to go to Vijayad<193>sa himself for succour. Vijayad<193>sa sent him ç
to his own disciple Gop<193>lad<193>sa who not only cured him but ç
also initiated him into the Order of the Harid<193>sas christening ç
him as `Jagann<193>tha-Vi<219><219>halad<193>sa' or, more popularly, ç
`Jagann<193>thad<193>sa'. This was in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1754.
Jagann<193>thad<193>sa has composed many works, the magnum opus being ç
the <185>r<200>harikath<193>m<216>tas<193>ra which he is said tohave ç
completed in his 82nd year! It is a voluminous poetical composition ç
of a thousand verses in Kannada, in the meter called  `bh<193>min<200><218>a<219>pad<200>'.  He  has  also ç
composed more than seven hundred songs †both devotional and didactic†in ç
the Kannada language.
His biographers have credited him withmanypsychicandsupernatural ç
powers.

@N1 = (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1590-1670)
Author of a well-known work on Sanskrit poetics,theRasaga<209>g<193>dhara, ç
Jagann<193>tha  Pa<207><195>ita was the  son  of Perubha<219><219>a ç
and Lak<218>m<200>. He belonged to Andhra Pradesh but spent most of ç
his life in North India.
He was the court pundit of Jeh<193><209>g<200>r and á<186><193>hjeh<193>n. ç
It was probably the latter who gave him the honorific `pa<207><195>itar<193>ja' ç
(`the king of scholars').
Some of his well-known works are: Vi<218><207>ulahar<200>, Ga<209>g<193>lahar<200>, ç
Sudh<193>lahar<200>, Am<216>talahar<200> and Lak<218>m<200>lahar<200>.

@NT = Jagann<193>tha-Pur<200>
One of the celebrated places of pilgrimage for the Hindus since centuries ç
is the Jagann<193>tha-pur<200> or Pur<200> in the modern Orissa state. ç
It is situated at a distance of477 kms. (310 miles) from Calcutta ç
and is on the eastern sea-shore. Bhubaneshvar, the capital of Orissa, ç
is just 60 kms. (36miles) away.
@EMERGENCY = The famous temple of Jagann<193>tha stands on a gentle ç
slope known as N<200>l<193>cala or N<200>laparvata in the pur<193><207>as ç
and the dharma·<193>stras.
@EMERGEN1 = The temple town is also called `Puru<218>ottamat<200>rtha.'
@EMERGEN1 = Sometimes a verse from the <184>gveda (10.155.3) is ç
quoted to support the theory that this place with its temple of wooden ç
images, is a very ancient centre of pilgrimage.
Paur<193><207>ic accounts declare that Indra-dyumna, the pious king ç
of the M<193>lava country with his capital at Avant<200> (modern Ujjayin<200>) ç
came here and built the temple at the command of Lord V<193>sudeva ç
(K<216><218><207>a). The wooden images of K<216><218><207>a, Balar<193>ma ç
andSubhadr<193>werepreparedbythe heavenly architect Vi·vakarma ç
himself. Though  the  king  had  been  specially instructed not to ç
look at the working on the images by Vi·vakarma, he did so, unable ç
to control the temptation. Hence Vi·va-karma left the images unfinished ç
and retired to heaven. This is the explanation given by the traditional ç
lore for the half-finished images now worshipped in the temple.
Oriental scholars are of the opinion that this holy place with K<216><218><207>a ç
worship (including the use of the wooden images in the shrine) is ç
quite ancient though Buddhist influence reigned supreme for some time ç
before the 5th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>
The centre of attraction of this place is the temple of Lord Jagann<193>tha. ç
The enclosure of the temple is almost a square, 196 metres (652 ft.) ç
by 190 metres (632 ft.) with a massive stone wall 6 metres (20 ft.) ç
high. The vim<193>na or central tower over the sanctum is 58 metres ç
(192 ft.) high. There is a large gate-way on each side of the enclosure, ç
the one on the east (si<221>hadv<193>ra) being the best.
There are almost 120 temples dedicated to various aspects of God like ç
<185>iva, Dev<200>, S<220>rya and others, in this enclosure.
The main shrine of Puru<218>ottama is very ancient. Kings like Co<195>aga<209>ga ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1078-1148) and Ana<209>ga Bh<200>ma Deva (<MS>A.D.<D> ç
1174) added other structures during their reign.
In the main temple there are four chambers: bhogamandira (hall of ç
offerings), n<193><219>amandira (hall of dance and music), jaganmohanamandira ç
(hall of pilgrims, where the pilgrims can assemble) and the garbhamandira ç
(inner sanctuary).
The Jagann<193>tha temple has a large contingent of attendants, divided ç
into 36 orders and 97 classes. At the head, is the R<193>j<193> of ç
Khurda who calls himself `the sweeper of Jagann<193>tha'.
The greatest event of the temple is the temple-car festival, known ç
as the `Rathay<193>tr<193>'. It starts on °<218><193><195>ha ·ukla ç
dvit<200>y<193>, (2nd day of the bright fortnight of °<218><193><195>ha, ç
usually in July) and ends on the da·am<200> (tenth) day of the same ç
fortnight. (See <MS>RATHAY°TR°<D> for details.)
@SPACE1 = 
The other major festival is the `Sn<193>nay<193>tr<193>' (bathing ç
procession) conducted on the Jye<218><219>ha P<220>r<207>im<193> (full-moon ç
day in Jye<218><219>ha, generally in June) when the three images are ç
brought out on to a platform and anointed by 108 pitchers of sacred ç
water. (See <MS>SN°NAY°TR°<D> also.)
The  wooden  images  are  usually replaced by similar ones every twelve ç
years. This is called `Navakalevara' (new body). Some relics (believed ç
to be those of K<216><218><207>a) are transferred from the old images ç
into the new ones.
One special feature of this temple is that caste barriers have been ç
given the go-by.
<185>a<209>kara (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 788-820) has established one of his ç
four chief monasteries in Pur<200>. Itiscalled `Govardhana Ma<219>ha' ç
or `Govardhana P<200><219>ha'.
R<193>m<193>nuja  (<MS>A. D.<D>  1017-1137)  had visited this sacred ç
place. So also Kab<200>r (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1440-1518). <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a ç
Caitanya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1485-1533) lived here for quite a long time ç
and was closely associated with the temple and the king Prat<193>parudra ç
of Orissa.
In Pur<200> also five t<200>rthas or holy places are mentioned, which ç
every pilgrim is expected to visit. They are: the pool of M<193>rka<207><195>eya, ç
the Va<219>a tree, Balar<193>ma, the sea and the pool of Indradyumna.

In the Vedas, chandas or metre, has been given great importance. While ç
reciting a mantra, one of the three factors to be remembered and honoured ç
is the chandas.
Among the well-known Vedic metres, jagat<200> is also one. It has ç
twelve syllables per line and four lines in a stanza. Fifteen varieties ç
of this meter have been mentioned in the works on poetry of the classical ç
period.
Indrava<221>·<193>, to<219>aka, bhuja<209>ga-pray<193>ta, va<221>·asthavila ç
and sragvi<207><200> are the more common varieties.
The general terrace or platform on which a Hindu temple stands is ç
also called `jagat<200>'. The word means in Sanskrit, earth or a world.

@SPACE = 
The two great epics†the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a and the Mah<193>bh<193>rata†have ç
made such a deep impression on the Indian mind that the core part ç
of the stories in them have percolated into the literature of other ç
religions of Indian origin like Jainism and Buddhism.
In the Jaina tradition, there is no single R<193>m<193>ya<207>a as ç
such. Eleven well-known Jaina works, of fairly early period, deal ç
with the story of R<193>ma. Out of these, the Paumacariyam of Vimala ç
S<220>ri (circa <MS>A.D.<D> 300-500) in Pr<193>k<216>t is the most ç
famous.
Evolution of R<193>ma story and allied literature continued for several ç
centuries (7th to the 14th). Some of the works were in Sanskrit and ç
some in Pr<193>k<216>t and Apabhra<221>·a (crude forms of Sanskrit ç
and local variations) languages.
Vimala S<220>ri declares that the R<193>m<193>-ya<207>a stories (of ç
the Hindus) are full oflies, absurdities and contradictions. To remove ç
these, he undertook the composition of Paumacariyam! (Pauma <%22>=<%0>Padma ç
= R<193>ma.)
Though he follows the main outline of V<193>lm<200>ki's story he has ç
made several changes, giving the whole work a Jaina colour. For instance: ç
R<193>ma never killed the golden deer or V<193>li. He never ate meat. ç
The v<193>naras were actually vidy<193>dharas (a race of supernatural ç
beings possessing extraordinary powers) and not monkeys. The r<193>k<218>asas ç
were highly cultured persons. V<193>li handed over his kingdom to ç
his younger brother Sugr<200>va and became a Jain monk.It is Lak<218>ma<207>a ç
who killed R<193>va<207>a. Lak<218>ma<207>a ultimately went to hell ç
since he refused to become a Jaina monk whereas Kaikey<200>, S<200>t<193> ç
and other ladies became Jaina nuns.
Many other changes also have been introduced into the body of the ç
story, like S<200>t<193> being the daughter of R<193>va<207>a and ç
Ma<207><195>odar<200>, Lak<218>ma<207>a killing the ·<220>dra ascetic ç
<185>amb<220>ka by mistake and so on.
It is obvious that these R<193>m<193>ya<207>as or R<193>ma-stories ç
were used more to propagate Jainism than to narrate the story itself.
@SPACE = 
@NT = Jainism
@SPACE = 
One of the religions of the world† great in principles though the ç
number of adherents is small†is Jainism. It is sometimes considered ç
as a `rebel child' of Hinduism†if the word Hinduism is takenin a ç
geographical sense†or as an independent religion, though allied with ç
it closely.
The Jains claim great antiquity to their religion, the earliest T<200>rtha<209>kara† ç
propagator of spiritual wisdom†being the sage <184><218>abhadeva mentioned ç
as an ancient sage even in the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a. Recorded ç
history, however, recognises only two: P<193>r·van<193>tha (8th century ç
<MS>B.<|>C.<D>) and Mah<193>v<200>ra (599-527<MS> B.<|>C.<D>).
Mah<193>v<200>ra (also known as Vardha-m<193>na) left behind him a ç
well-organised religious Order of Jaina monks.
Due to the missionary activities of the Jaina teachers, the religion ç
attracted kings and nobles as well as the common people and spread ç
to many parts of India. The Mauryan emperor Candragupta is said to ç
have become a convert to Jainism and settled in <185>rava<207>abe<202>ago<202>a ç
(of Karnataka) during his last days.
Jainism has a philosophy and a way of life which is in consonance ç
with that philosophy. It recognises two fundamental principles†the ç
j<200>vatattva (living beings) and the aj<200>vatattva (non-living ç
objects). These two principles come into contact with one another ç
and forge certain energies that bring forth birth, various experiences ç
of life and death.
@SPACE1 = 
This process can be stopped and the energies already forged can be ç
destroyed by a course of discipline leading to salvation.
The prescribed ethical code is fivefold: ahi<221>s<193> (non-violence), ç
satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacarya (celibacy) and aparigraha ç
(non-acceptance of gifts).
Since certain relaxations are allowed to householders in the observance ç
of thesevows out of necessity, they become `a<207>uvrata' (`the small ç
vow'). But for monks their observance is absolute. They therefore ç
become `mah<193>vratas' (`great vows') in their case.
The anek<193>ntav<193>da or sy<193>dv<193>da is an important aspect ç
of Jaina philosophy.

@N1 = (`penance in or with water')
Expiation for sins committed, knowingly or unknowingly, by performing ç
the prescribed penances is an ancient practice in Hinduism. `K<216>cchra' ç
is a general term applied to many of these expiations. Jalak<216>cchra†also ç
called toyak<216>cchra, udakak<216>cchra or varu<207>ak<216>cchra†is ç
one of them.
It has been described in several ways. According to one version, it ç
consists in subsisting only on water mixed with ground barley, for ç
one month.
Another version is that the sinner should spend a whole day and night ç
fasting, and immersing himself in water. This should be followed by ç
the repetition of the G<193>yatr<200>mantra 1008 times the next day.
See also <MS>K<184>CCHRA.<D>
@NT = j<193>landharabandha
Works on Ha<219>hayoga concentrate on various exercises known as <193>sanas ç
and mudr<193>s or bandhas by which the longevity, health and stamina ç
of the body can be increased.
The j<193>landharabandha is one such exercise wherein the throat has ç
to be contracted and the chin pressed firmly against the chest.
It is capable of destroying a number of diseases of the throat.
More details†many of which quite complicated†are given in the treatises ç
like the Ha<219>hayogaprad<200>pik<193>, the Dhy<193>na-bindu Upani<218>ad, ç
the Yoga·ikh<193> Upani<218>ad and others. However the exercises ç
have to be practised under the direct care of experts.
@NT = jalpa
Indian philosophical systems generally adopt a twofold method in propagating ç
their teachings: statement of their principles and countering the ç
arguments of the opponents. Among the various methods of the latter, ç
jalpa is also one. In this type, each of the disputants tries to demolish ç
the arguments of the opponent and establish his own standpoint or ç
theory or principle using appropriate means of knowledge. In this ç
method, the desire to win is stronger than the desire to know the ç
truth!

@NT = Jamadagni
Listed among the Saptar<218>is†the groupof seven great sages†and ç
the gotrapravartakas (originators of lineages), Jamadagni was the ç
son of the sage <184>c<200>kaand the princess Satyavat<200>. He had ç
married Re<207>uk<193>, the daughter of a king, Prasenajit.
He had five sons, of whom the famous Para·ur<193>ma†considered  as  a  partial ç
incarnation of Vi<218><207>u†was the last.
Once,  Jamadagni  suspected  the fidelity of his wife Re<207>uk<193> ç
and ordered his sons to behead her. The first four refused and were ç
cursed by him. But, Para·ur<193>ma complied with the command. Pleased ç
at his obedience, Jamadagni granted him a boon. Then Para·ur<193>ma ç
asked for the revival of his mother, withdrawal of the curse against ç
his elder brothers and also requested that he give up his irascible ç
temperament. Jamadagni agreed for all.
Jamadagni was killed by <185><220>rasena, the son of K<193>rtav<200>rya-Arjuna, ç
since he had refused to hand over the celestial cow Kapil<193>. This ç
was the main reason for Para·ur<193>ma's tours of conquest against ç
the k<218>attriyas to destroy them.

@NT = J<193>mbav<193>n
The  R<193>m<193>ya<207>a  of V<193>lm<200>ki which describes ç
the story of R<193>ma, has many interesting personalities involved ç
in the story. One such†the wise old man†is J<193>mbav<193>n. He is ç
said to have sprung out of the mouth of Brahm<193>, the creator, when ç
he once yawned (j<216>bha<207>a = yawning). He was the king of bhall<220>kas ç
or bears. He had an unusually long span of life and had witnessed ç
many a battle between the devas (gods) and the d<193>navas (demons). ç
He had helped the gods during the churning of the ocean (samudramathana), ç
had drunk the am<216>ta (ambrosia or nectar) and had become very strong.
During a sacrifice performed by the asura king Bali, he was in charge ç
of medicinal herbs.
He was a great devotee of <185>iva and used to visit Kail<193>sa regularly ç
every day.
He was at first the commander-in-chief of V<193>li and later on switched ç
over his loyalties to Sugr<200>va after the latter's banishment. He ç
was one of the prominent members of the group of monkeys that was ç
sent to the south by Sugr<200>va, in search of S<200>t<193>. Itwas ç
he who encouraged and inspired themonkeys when they were very much ç
dejected by not finding S<200>t<193>. Again, it was he who inspired ç
Hanum<193>n to cross the ocean to bring the news of S<200>t<193>.
During the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a war, he rendered invaluable help, ç
especially by his sage counsels and timely intervention.
When K<216><218><207>a was implicated in the loss of the Syamantakama<207>i†a ç
jewel that used to give a lot of gold every day†he traced the jewel ç
ultimately to J<193>mbav<193>n's cave. K<216><218><207>a fought with ç
him for 28 days before vanquishing him. J<193>mbav<193>n had to concede ç
defeat and give, not only the jewel,but also his daughter J<193>mbavat<200>, ç
in marriage.

The king Nimi, the son of Ik<218>v<193>ku and grandson of Vaivasvata ç
Manu, gave up his body due to the curse of the sage Vasi<218><219>ha. ç
Since there was chaos in the kingdom, people churned the body of Nimi ç
and out came a person who was named `Videha,' `Mithi' and `Janaka'. ç
He was crowned as the new king. Hereafter, all persons born in his ç
lineage came to be known as Vaideha or Maithila or Janaka.
The original name of the Janaka of the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a was ç
S<200>radhvaja. When he was tilling his land as a part of the ceremony ç
connected with the Putrak<193>me<218><219>i sacrifice he got a female ç
baby inside a golden box.He named her `S<200>t<193>.' His own daughter ç
(born later) was <188>rmi<202><193>. His wife was Sumedh<193>.
When he arranged the svaya<221>vara (marriage by choice by the bride) ç
of his daughter S<200>t<193>, he had stipulated that whoever strung ç
the <185>ivadhanus (the bow of <185>iva which was in his possession) ç
would win her as his wife. <185>r<200> R<193>ma did it and married ç
S<200>t<193>.
Janaka's name appears in the Mah<193>bh<193>rata several times. ç
His sage talks with Pa<210>ca·ikha (about spiritual wisdom), Sumedh<193> ç
(on the need to follow the duties of a k<218>attriya even after attaining ç
j<210><193>na or knowledge), A·ma (on dharma in general) and Kahola ç
have been given prominence in that epic.
His equanimity due to the attainment of spiritual wisdom has been ç
described in the incident where he received the news of his capital ç
Mithil<193> being reduced to ashes due to a great fire.
His conversation with the sage Par<193>·ara has now become well-known ç
as the Par<193>·arag<200>t<193> (<185><193>ntiparva 290-298).
He stressed the importance of giving up <193>·<193> (desire) and mamat<193> ç
(attachment) for attaining true happiness.
According to the B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka Upani<218>ad (4th  Chapter)  he ç
received spiritual wisdom from the great sage Y<193>j<210>avalkya.

The sages Ca<207><195>abh<193>rgava, Pi<209>gala, Jaimini and A<209>girasa ç

As the sacrifice progressed, serpents in their thousands started falling ç

During the final stages, when Tak<218>aka was being forced towards ç
the sacrificial fire, the young sage °stika arrived on the scene and ç
successfully stopped the massacre of the reptiles by convincing the ç
king Janamejaya through his sweet speech and powerful logic. The king ç
