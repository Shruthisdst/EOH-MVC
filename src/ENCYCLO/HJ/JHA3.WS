This is a dissertation on the subjectof j<200>vanmukti or liberation ç
even while living in the body, by the famous Vidy<193>ra<207>ya who ç
was the founder of the Vijayanagara empire and a pontiff of the monastery ç
at <185><216><209>ger<200> (from <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1377 to <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1386). His place among the writers on Advaita Ved<193>nta philosophy ç
is very high.
This treatise is in prose and is spread over five chapters. The first ç
chapter (J<200>vanmuktipram<193><207>a-prakara<207>a) proves the ç
reality of the j<200>vanmukti state by quoting profusely from many ç
authoritative works like the Bhagavadg<200>t<193>, the Mah<193>-bh<193>rata, ç
the Bh<193>gavata, the Laghuyoga-v<193>si<218><219>ha and the ç
S<220>tasa<221>hit<193>.
The second chapter (V<193>san<193>k<218>aya-prakara<207>a) deals ç
with practical methods of overcoming and eliminating v<193>san<193>s ç
or evil tendencies carried over from many lives, by suggesting appropriate ç
remedies.
The third chapter (Manon<193>·a-prakara<207>a) deals in detail, ç
with the subject of manon<193>·a or `(apparent) destruction of mind' ç
by drawing heavily from the Yoga-s<220>tras of Pata<210>jali (200 ç
<MS>B.<|>C.<D>). `Manon<193>·a' simply means the destruction of the ç
tendency of the mind to rise by itself impelled by the old tendencies.
The next chapter (Svar<220>pasiddhi- prayojana-prakara<207>a) delineates ç
five kinds of advantages that a j<200>vanmukta-yogi gets in life which ç
includes great bliss.
The last chapter (Vidvatsa<221>ny<193>sa-prakara<207>a) is a detailed ç
commentary on the minor Upani<218>ad, the Paramaha<221>sopa-ni<218>ad ç
belonging to the <185>ukla Yajurveda. It  gives  practically  all  information ç
connected with sa<221>ny<193>sa including the code of conduct prescribed ç
for a sa<221>ny<193>sin.

@N1 = (`·r<193>ddha [of oneself<R>ç
performed by] a person still living')
<185>r<193>ddha (obsequial rite) is an ancient ritual. If a person ç
does not have children or successors who are eligible to perform his ç
·r<193>ddha after his death, or, if he feels that none of them may ç
do it properly, he may perform it himself for himself. This is called ç
`j<200>vat-·r<193>ddha' or `j<200>va·r<193>ddha'. It has to be performed ç
every month for a year and then every year for twelve years.
The procedure as described in some works like the Baudh<193>yana ç
G<216>hya·e<218>a-s<220>tras (3.19) is quite exhaustive and complicated. ç
Some of the steps involvedin it are: fasting, kindling the sacred ç
fireand offering oblations with certain mantras from the <184>gveda ç
(4.58.3), giving gifts of prescribed objects, burning an effigy of ç
his own. observing an a·auca (ceremonial impurity), performing ekoddi<218><219>a ç
rite and a few other rituals.

@NT = j<210><193>na
@N1 = (`knowledge')
Derived from the root-verb `j<210><193>' (= to know) the word `j<210><193>na' ç
is commonly interpreted as `knowledge'.
This knowledge is of two kinds: that which is got by the normal means ç
of sense perception and that which is obtained by intuition.
Most of the philosophical systems accept three sources of knowledge: ç
pratyak<218>a (direct perception), anum<193>na (inference) and <193>ptav<193>kya ç
(verbal testimony) or <193>gama (scriptural testimony).
Sometimes three more are added, taking the total to six. Those are: ç
upam<193>na (comparison), arth<193>patti (postulation) and anupalabdhi ç
(non-perception).
J<210><193>na as intuitive knowledge†called `aparok<218><193>nubh<220>ti' ç
(direct experience)† comes through the purification of the mind by ç
yogic disciplines and meditation on °tman/Brahman or God.
@NT = J<210><193>nak<193><207><195>a
@N1 = (`branch [of the Veda<R>ç
devoted to] spiritual wisdom')
The Vedas are the foundational scriptures of Hinduism. According to ç
one of the methods of dividing them, they comprise three parts: Karmak<193><207><195>a, ç
Up<193>san<193>-k<193><207><195>a and J<210><193>nak<193><207><195>a.
The Sa<221>hit<193> and the Br<193>hma<207>a parts of the Vedas deal ç
mainly with karma or Vedic rituals. Hence they are classified under ç
the heading `Karmak<193><207><195>a'.
The Upani<218>ads, which often form a part of the °ra<207>yaka section, ç
deal with j<210><193>na (spiritual knowledge or wisdom) and hence ç
are called `J<210><193>nak<193><207><195>a'.
The  portions  of  the  °ra<207>yakas, including some of the Upani<218>ads, ç
which teach  up<193>san<193>s  or  special  kinds  of meditations ç
(also called `vidy<193>s'), are grouped under the title, `Up<193>san<193>k<193><207><195>a'.
However, the last classification is, comparatively speaking, less ç
common.
@NT = j<210><193>na-karma-samuccaya-v<193>da
@N1 = (`The school [which accepts that] j<210><193>na or knowledge ç
and karma or ritualistic action can be combined')
At one stage, in the growth of the polemical literature of Ved<193>nta, ç
one of thebones of contention was whether j<210><193>naor knowledge ç
of the <193>tman and karma or ritualistic action could be combined. ç
The school that advocated the possibility of the combination came ç
to be known as `j<210><193>nakarmasamuccayav<193>da'. It was mostly ç
the Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita of R<193>m<193>nuja (<MS>A. D.<D> 1017-1137) ç
that subscribed to this view. The advaitins including <185>a<209>kara ç
(<MS>A.D.<D> 788-820) opposed it vehemently.
@SPACE1 = 
The doctrine needs some elaboration. According to the dualistic schools ç
of Ved<193>nta, Brahman (God), the j<200>vas (the individual souls) ç
and the world are all different from one another. Hence, even after ç
a j<200>va, the individual soul in bondage, realises his <193>tman-nature ç
through j<210><193>na, as the pure spirit different from the body- ç
mind complex, he continues to perceive the world and the other j<200>vas ç
as existing and as different from himself. Hence he has no problem ç
in performing karma or actions prescribed by the scriptures as his ç
duties, as long as he continues to live in the body which is a product ç
of his past(or pr<193>rabdha) karmas. So, combining karma or ritualistic ç
actions and ordained duties, with his j<210><193>na or subjective ç
realisation of his being the <193>tman or the pure spirit, is not ç
at all a problem.
However, according to the Advaita Ved<193>nta of <185>a<209>kara, ç
Brahman, °tman (the true nature of the j<200>va) and the world outside ç
are all one and the same. Since the j<200>vas and the world are illusory ç
perceptions†like the perception of a snake in a ropein semi-darkness†which ç
illusion will disappear on the rise of j<210><193>na or direct and ç
immediate perception of the truth as it is, a j<210><193>ni (man of ç
knowledge, the liberated soul) will not see anything outside himself ç
or as different from himself. He will see only one reality, the one ç
without a second. Hence it is impossible for him to do any karma ç
or rituals which presupposes the perception of duality. Consequently, ç
sarvakarma parity<193>ga or totally giving up all actions, will come ç
to him most naturally. So, j<210><193>nakarma- samuccaya is simply ç
out of question.
If K<216><218><207>a could teach the Bhagavad-g<200>t<193> to Arjuna ç
or <185>a<209>kara himself could do so much work in his life-time ç
as vanquishing the opponents or writing philosophical treatises or ç
making disciples or establishing Ma<219>has one will be forced to ç
concede that j<210><193>nakarmasamuccaya is possible. Otherwise ç
one has to come to the unpleasant conclusion that neither of them ç
was enlightened!
What <185>a<209>kara perhaps meant was that desire-motivated or selfish ç
action wasnot possible for a j<210><193>ni though lokasa<209>graha ç
or unselfish service to the world was always possible.
@NT = j<210><193>nam<193>rga
@N1 = (`the pathofj<210><193>naor knowledge')
Since very ancient times, two paths (m<193>rga = path) have been laid ç
out before human beings: the karmam<193>rga and the j<210><193>nam<193>rga ç
(the path of action and the path of knowledge).
In the former, a person has to perform all actions ordained by the ç
scriptures to attain progress in worldly life and also prepare for ç
spiritual enlightenment.
In the latter, which is supposed to be a continuation of the former ç
and superior to it, one is expected to give up all actions save those ç
needed for the maintenance of the body to continue s<193>dhan<193>s ç
or spiritual practices.

@NT = j<210><193>namudr<193>
@N1 = (`pose ofknowledgeand<R>ç

Mudr<193>s are poses of hands which indicate or signify some idea ç
or teaching. They are generally shown in the icons ofgods and goddesses, ç
sages and great persons.
J<210><193>namudr<193> is generally exhibited in the right hand of ç
images of divinities like Dak<218>i<207><193>m<220>rti and Subrahma<207>ya ç
as also of <193>c<193>ryas like <185>a<209>kara and Madhva.
In this mudr<193>, the top of the fore finger is made to rest on the ç
top of the thumb, the other three fingers being shown either straight ç
or slightly bent. It suggests the absorption of the j<200>va in Brahman ç
or God.
Sometimes, the right hand in this pose is kept on the heart and the ç
left hand with the palm facing upwards is placed on the left thigh. ç
This is said to be dear to <185>r<200> R<193>ma.

N<193>yanm<193>rs or N<193>yan<193>rs are the great <185>aiva saints ç
of Tamil Nadu who revived <185>aivism when Jainism was having its ç
heydays. Though 63 of them have been listed, only four of them have ç
been very famous. Perhaps, the most well-known even among them was ç
J<210><193>nasambandhar, also known as Tiruj<210><193>nasambandhar ç
or just Sambandhar.
It is said that when his parents† <185>ivap<193>dah<216>dayar and ç
Bhagavatiy<193>r†had left him, as a baby, on the bank of a Kaly<193><207><200> ç
(temple-tank) while taking their bath, he started crying and was breast-fed ç
by the Divine Mother P<193>rvat<200> herself. Since then he developed ç
the power of composing devotional poems of exquisite literary grace, ç
on Lord <185>iva.
He travelled extensively all over the land of Tamil Nadu, often with ç
other well- known saints like N<200>laka<207><219>hay<193><202> P<193>n<193>r ç
(an accomplished player of the V<200><207><193> or lute) and Appar ç
(a senior contemporary and himself a great saint).
He is credited to have performed many miracles, at the request of ç
the distressed people. Some of them are: curing the daughter of the ç
king M<193><202>ava, of her serious incurable disease; dispelling ç
the severe cold wave which had hit the village <185>a<209>gunr<220>r; ç
getting gold coins through divine intervention for his father who ç
wanted to perform a great sacrifice; reviving a dead merchant at a ç
place called Tirumarug<193><202>; converting the king of Madurai to ç
<185>aivism by exhibiting divine miracles and also curing him of a ç
fell disease;  converting  many  Jains  and Buddhists back to <185>aivism; ç
reviving P<220>mp<193>vai, the daughter of <185>ivane·ar to life, ç
from her ashes and so on.

J<210><193>nasambandhar was also known as Pi<202><202>ai N<193>yan<193>r ç

Human beings are essentially divine. The divinity within†called `<193>tman'†has ç
tobe rediscovered, fully manifested and experienced. Once this is ç
achieved, the cycle of transmigration ceases for ever. This is the ç
goal of life and is variously termed as mukti or mok<218>a, kaivalya ç
and nirv<193><207>a.
Traditional Hinduism, as reflected in the Ved<193>ntic scriptures ç
and their commentaries, generally accepts two paths of s<193>dhan<193>s ç
or spiritual disciplines, to this mok<218>a. They are j<210><193>na ç
(knowledge) andbhakti (devotion). (See <MS>BHAKTI<D> and <MS>BHAKTIYOGA.<D>)
Abandonment of selfish and desire- motivated actions and sincere performance ç
of ordained duties leads to citta·uddhi or purification of mind. Practice ç
of the a<218><219><193><209>gayoga (the yoga prescribed by Pata<210>jali, ç
consisting of eight graded steps) helps in developing concentration ç
of mind. Both these spiritual disciplines have been accepted as aids ç
to the practice of j<210><193>na and bhakti.
The basic texts of Ved<193>nta, viz., the prasth<193>natraya  (the  Upani<218>ads,  the ç
Brahmas<220>tras and the Bhagavadg<200>t<193>) have described ç
two types of mukti: the sadyomukti (instant liberation) and the kramamukti ç
(gradual liberation). Two more terms which are the approximate equivalents  of  these  are:  j<200>vanmukti ç
(liberation even while living in this body) and videhamukti (liberation ç
after the fall of the body).
Performance of one's ordained duties coupled with contemplation on ç
the Vedic deities results in kramamukti (gradual liberation) of the ç
j<200>va (the individual soul) by taking to the Arc<200>r<193>dim<193>rga ç
(the path of light) and going to Brahmaloka (the world of Brahm<193>, ç
the creator). Final liberation will come on the dissolution of the ç
Brahmaloka at the end of the cycle of creation.
Sadyomukti (instant liberation) however, comes from j<210><193>na ç
resulting from j<210><193>nayoga.  Though  the  word  `j<210><193>na' ç
derived from the verbal root j<210><193> means knowledge, it has ç
a higher philosophical connotation in Ved<193>ntic works. It is not ç
only intellectual knowledge but also intuitive experience. It starts ç
with the former and ends with the latter.
But this has to be accomplished gradually.
@SPACE1 = 
Firstly, a person has to attain citta-·uddhi or a fair degree of purity ç
of mind by discharging his duties and responsibilities as prescribed ç
by the holy books.
Secondly, he has to cultivate s<193>dhana-catu<218><219>aya or the ç
fourfold Ved<193>ntic discipline.
Thirdly, he has to approach a compe-tent guru, learn the truths of ç
Ved<193>nta from him and contemplate on them, whichwill ultimately ç
result in the direct experience of the <193>tman.
These three may now be described more fully.
Citta·uddhi or purity of mind is attained by avoiding all actions ç
and types of behaviour opposed to the principles of dharma or righteousness; ç
by giving up all actions motivated by selfish desires and, by performing ç
the ordained duties to the best of one's ability as service to mankind ç
as also to please God.
The s<193>dhanacatu<218><219>aya comprises the following disciplines:
Viveka or discrimination between the real (the <193>tman, the soul) ç
and the unreal (the evanescent world);
Vair<193>gya or the spirit of renunciation resulting in giving up ç
the evanescent things of the world, for the sake of realising the ç
<193>tman;
<185>am<193>di<218>a<219>ka or cultivation of the six qualities viz., ç
·ama (peace of mind), dama (control of senses), uparati (withdrawal ç
of senses and not allowing them to go towards the sense-objects once ç
again), titik<218><193> (forbearance), ·raddh<193> (faith in the scriptures, ç
in the teachers and in oneself) and sam<193>dh<193>na (concentration ç
of mind);
Mumuk<218>utva or intense desire for mok<218>a or liberation.
Once a person is fired by the intense desire for mok<218>a, he will ç
approach a guru or a competent spiritual teacher†this is called `gur<220>pasadana'†in ç
search of j<210><193>na or knowledge that can give him mok<218>a.
The guru should be not only well-versed in the scriptural lore, knowing ç
their true essence, but also be a person of spiritual attainment.
Once he is convinced about the fitness of the aspiring disciple, he ç
will teach him the Ved<193>ntic truths as described in the prasth<193>natraya ç
and also from his own experience. The disciple should do ·rava<207>a ç
or hear it attentively. After clearing his doubts through questioning ç
and manana or reflection, he should do nididhy<193>sana or meditation ç
on the truth as comprehended by him, viz., that the nature of his ç
own <193>tman or the Self is pure consciousness, completely separate ç
and different from the body-mind complex. This meditation will ultimately ç
result in the aparok<218><193>nubhava or the direct experience of ç
one's true nature as the <193>tman. Once this experience is gained, ç
he will become mukta or liberated. He may continue to live in the ç
body for some more time due to the effect of the pr<193>rabdhakarma ç
which has started the present birth. In this state he is known as ç
a j<200>vanmukta (one who is liberated even while living). Non-attachment ç
and universal love are his chief characteristics.
At the end of this life, when pr<193>rabdhakarma  gets  exhausted,  he ç
becomes a videhamukta, totally liberated from all future bodies too.

Acquisition of knowledge, whether temporal or spiritual, is basic ç
to life. Though spiritual knowledge is essential for attaining liberation ç
from sa<221>s<193>ra or transmigratory existence, temporal know-ledge ç
can never be ignored. It is this knowledge that helps us to live in ç
this world. If properly utilised, it can be an asset for spiritual ç
life too.
Since j<210><193>na or sensory knowledge is acquired through the five ç
sense-organs, viz., cak<218>us (organ of sight), ·rotra (organ of ç
hearing), ghr<193><207>a (organ of smell), rasan<193> (organ of taste) ç
and tvak (organ of touch), they are called j<210><193>nendriyas or ç
organs that bring knowledge to us. In common language they are the ç
eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue and the skin.
They are the evolutes of the sattva- part of the five primordial elements ç
or tanm<193>tras according to Ved<193>nta.
These are the subtle organs located inside the physical organs like ç
the eye, the ear etc.

If Hinduism has survived in spite ofexternal aggressions, and internal ç

the Bhakti Movement, over several centuries.
Sant J<210><193>ne·var (also known as J<210><193>nadev) is the brightest ç
jewel among the saints of Maharashtra. He was born as the second son ç
of Vi<219><219>hala Pant and Rakhum<193> B<193><200> in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1275 at °<202>and<200> near Pune in Maharashtra. Niv<216>tti was his ç
elder brother. Sop<193>na and Mukt<193>b<193><200> were his younger ç
brother and sister.
Vi<219><219>hala Pant had taken sa<221>ny<193>sa from the well-known ç
saint R<193>m<193>nanda of K<193>·i by telling him a lie that he had ç
no dependents. Actually, he had been married to Rakhum<193>b<193><200> ç
who had not permitted him for sa<221>ny<193>sa, which was necessary. ç
When R<193>m<193>nanda came to know of this, he was furious and sent ç
Vi<219><219>hala Pant back to his wife.
Since he had returned to the life of a householder after sa<221>ny<193>sa, ç
which wasconsidered as a heinous sin, the contemporary society had ç
boycotted him. Hence, the children born, could not be administered ç
the sacraments normal to the Hindu br<193>hma<207>as. So, he and his ç
wife drowned themselves in a river, leaving the children as orphans.
However, the children, by the dint of their learning and yogic powers, ç
earned the respect of the society.
Niv<216>tti, the eldest of them, was a highly evolved soul. He was ç
blessed with spiritual wisdom by a great saint Gayan<200>-n<193>th. ç
Niv<216>tti in turn initiated J<210><193>ne·var also into the mysteries ç
of spiritual wisdom.
Many miracles have been attributed to J<210><193>ne·var. Some of them ç
are: making a bison repeat the Vedic mantras; bringing a dead person ç
back to life; travelling in the air sitting upon an old brick wall, ç
to meet a ha<219>hayogi called C<193><209>gadeva, who was coming on ç
a tiger and so on.

j<200>v<193>tman as a fundamental aspect of creation and the created ç
world. He has three capacities: j<210><193>t<216>tva (the capacity ç
to know); kart<216>tva (the capacity to perform actions) and bhokt<216>tva ç
(the capacity to experience the results of these actions). Hence he ç
is called j<210><193>t<216> (the knower), kart<216> (doer) and bhokt<216> ç
(enjoyer or experiencer).
These three capacities distinguish himfrom prak<216>ti or the insentient ç
nature and are therefore a sign of life and consciousness.

One of the spoons used to pour oblations into the consecrated fire ç
in a Vedic sacrifice, the juh<220> is made of the pal<193>·a wood ç
(bastard teak, Butea frondosa) and has a cup-shaped bowl at the ç
end. It is held in the right hand.
All <193>jya offerings (offerings of ghee) are to be done with the ç
juh<220>. It can also be used when no other implement is mentioned ç
for pouring the offerings.

@NT = Jyauti<218>a
@N1 = (`sciencepertainingtolight', [astronomy and astrology])
Jyauti<218>a†also known as Jyoti<218>a or Jyoti··<193>stra†has two ç
aspects: Vedic and post-Vedic. The former is considered as a Ved<193><209>ga, ç
a subsidiary science of Veda, that helps in the performance of Vedic ç
sacrifices.
Since yaj<210>as or sacrifices had to be performed at certain auspicious ç
moments, these had to be determined first. Ved<193><209>ga Jyauti<218>a ç
was the result of such efforts.
°rcajyauti<218>a of the <184>gveda (with 36 verses) and Y<193>ju<218>ajyauti<218>a ç
of the Yajurveda (with 43 verses) are the two works available now ç
on this subject. They are assigned to the period 1400 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> ç
Lagadha is said to be the author of the latter work which also has ç
a commentary by Som<193>kara of South India. The verses are very terse ç
and even the commentary does not throw much light.
An Atharvajyauti<218>a also has come to light. It has 17 chapters ç
and 162 verses. It is considered as a much later work.
According to these works on Ved<193><209>ga Jyauti<218>a, the year ç
was solar and had 366 days. A yuga or a cakra or a cycle of 5 such ç
years had been accepted for purposes of calculations. These five years ç
were known as: sa<221>vatsara, parivatsara, id<193>vatsara, anuvatsara ç
and idvatsara.
A cycle of five years contained 1830 days and 124 fortnights (62 full-moons ç
and 62 new-moons). This type of calculation of the year was useful ç
in the perform- ance of the well-known Dar·a and P<220>r<207>am<193>sa ç
sacrifices. Once in five years two lunar months (60 days) used to ç
be added to the lunar year to make it equal to the solar year.
A few more points concerning Ved<193><209>ga Jyauti<218>a may now ç
be noted:
@SPACE1 = 
1.<+>This way of calculation probably disappeared by 100 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> ç
as the post-Vedic astronomy and almanacs developed.
2.<+>Even in the earlier period it was probably not very popular.
3.<+>The basis for this Jyauti<218>a was the 27 nak<218>atras or asterisms ç
and not the twelve r<193>·is or zodiacal signs.
Ved<193><209>ga Jyauti<218>a was gradually transcended by the works ç
of °ryabha<219>a I (b.<MS>A.D.<D> 476), Var<193>hamihira (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
580), Brahmagupta (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 628), Bh<193>skara I (7th century ç
<MS>A.<|>D.<D>), °ryabha<219>a II (circa <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 950) and Bh<193>skara ç
II (b. <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1114). This helped in the development of Hindu ç
astronomy and astrology.
Hindu astrology is generally known as `Phala Jyauti<218>a'. If astronomy ç
deals with the physical movement of the planets and the stars that ç
are seen directly by the eye, astrology (the phala-jyauti<218>a part ç
of the science of luminary cosmic objects) deals with the unseen results ç
and effects they have on our lives, to be experienced in course of ç
time.
The most important basis for this phala-jyauti<218>a or Hindu astrology ç
is the belief that the stars and the planets at the time of birth ç
of a child, have a profound influence on its life, determining the ç
duration of its life, general condition of its body and psyche, important ç
events in its life and so on.
This is determined by mapping the janmar<193>·i (the r<193>·i or zodiacal ç
sign based on the nak<218>atra or asterism at the time of birth) and ç
the janmalagna (the r<193>·i in the eastern horizon at the time of ç
sunrise, on the day of birth).
@SPACE1 = 
The zodiac comprises the 12 r<193>·is (from Me<218>a, or Aries to ç
M<200>na or Pisces) in which the 27 nak<218>atras or asterisms (from ç
A·vin<200> to Revat<200>) are distributed.
Each one of the seven planets, the two nodal points (designated as ç
R<193>hu and Ketu) and the twenty-seven asterisms, has its own effect†good ç
or bad†on the human being, depending upon the janmar<193>·i and the ç
janmaku<207><195>ali. The problem, however, is in interpreting their ç
combined effect at a given point of time, which depends not only on ç
the astrological calculations, but also on a certain degree of intuition.
Hence, determining and predicting the future is the most difficult ç
part of Hindu astrology. About 40 methods have been projected out ç
of which the one known as `Vi<221>·ottaripaddhati' has been more widelyaccepted, ç
mostly in South India. The A<218><219>ottaripaddhati is more common ç
in the North.
Based on the Ved<193><209>ga Jyauti<218>a, the `siddh<193>ntas,' secondary ç
works on Hindu astronomy and astrology, came into being in the later ç
period. Works of °ryabha<219>a, Var<193>hamihira and Bh<193>skar<193>c<193>rya ç
belong to this group. These works have their commentaries†generally ç
known as `k<193>rik<193>s'†further amplifying the subject.
Works of Par<193>·ara and Jaimini, the S<220>ryasiddh<193>nta (author ç
unknown), Var<193>hamihira's Pa<210>casiddh<193>ntik<193>, B<216>hat-sa<221>hit<193> ç
and B<216>hajj<193>taka are considered the  most  important  works  of  Hindu ç
astrology.
Another interesting aspect of Hindu astrology is the pra·na·<193>stra ç
or the science of answering questions. Here, a horoscope is cast for ç
the time the question is asked and the results predicted, based on ç
it.
Some findings from Greek astrology seem to have been borrowed by the ç
Hindu authors of astrological works, though most of the development ç
was indigenous.
@NT = Jye<218><219>h<193>
@N1 = (`the elder one')
See <MS>ALAK<186>M®.<D>
In Hindu astrology, it is the 18th nak<218>atra or constellation. ç
The stars of this group are: alpha, sigma, and tau scorpii. It has ç
a malefic influence. Persons born when the moon is in this nak<218>atra ç
are assigned to the r<193>k<218>asaga<207>a, prone to violence and ç
quarrels.
@NT = Jyotirli<209>gas
@N1 = (`li<209>gas of light')
When Brahm<193> and Vi<218><207>u were quarrelling about their mutual ç
greatness, <185>iva is said to have manifested himself as a jyotirli<209>ga ç
or li<209>ga (pillar) of light. He told them that, between them, whoever ç
succeeded in finding his (li<209>ga's) extremity, was the greater ç
one.
Twelve li<209>gas, spread all over India, are specially designated ç
as Jyotirli<209>gas. Pilgrimage to these is considered as very meritorious.
These Jyotirli<209>gas are: Soman<193>tha (in Gujarat), Mallik<193>rjuna ç
(in <185>r<200>·aila, Andhra Pradesh), Mah<193>k<193>la (in Ujjayin<200>, ç
Madhya Pradesh), Parame·vara or O<209>k<193>re·vara (in O<209>k<193>ra, ç
an island in the Narmad<193> river), Ked<193>ra (in the Him<193>layas), ç
Bh<200>m<193>·a<209>kara (at the source of the river Bh<200>m<193> ç
in Maharashtra), Vi·ve·vara (in K<193>·<200> or V<193>r<193><207>as<200>, ç
Uttar Pradesh), Tryambake·vara (near N<193>sik in Maharashtra), Vaidyan<193>tha ç
(in Cit<193>bh<220>mi, Bihar), N<193>ge·a (in Dv<193>rak<193>, Gujarat), ç
R<193>me·vara (in Setubandha, Tamil Nadu) and Gh<216><218><207>e·a ç
(in <185>iv<193>laya, near Daulata-bad of Maharashtra).
The <185>ivapur<193><207>a (Ko<219>irudrasa<221>hit<193>) narrates ç
the legends connected with these li<209>gas.
@NT = Jyotir Ma<219>ha
With a view to consolidating and continuing his work of rejuvenation ç
of Ved<193>ntic religion, <185>a<209>kara (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 788-820) ç
established four Ma<219>has or monasteries, in the four cardinal directions ç
of the country. The one he established in the north is known as Jyotir ç
Ma<219>ha or Uttar<193>mn<193>ya Ma<219>ha. To<219>ak<193>c<193>rya ç
(one of the four chief disciples of <185>a<209>kara) was its first ç
abbot.
The place where this Ma<219>ha is situated is called Jo·<200>ma<219>h. ç
It is 32 kms. (20miles) below and away from the well-known Him<193>layan ç
place of pilgrimage, Badar<200>n<193>tha or Badar<200>. It is at a ç
height of 1800 meters (6100 ft.).
Since it is impossible to stay at Badar<200> during winter, the chief ç
priest (known as `R<193>val') of the N<193>r<193>ya<207>a temple shifts ç
to Jyotir Ma<219>ha along with the Utsavam<220>rti (procession-image) ç
and other essential articles, generally in November. He shifts back ç
sometime during May.
There is an ancient temple of Narasi<221>ha here. There is also a ç
temple of <185>iva (known as Jyot<200>·vara). A cave where <185>a<209>kara ç
used to sit in meditation and a mulberry tree under which he used ç
to worship are also located here.

@NT = jyoti<218>mat<200>
@N1 =  (`Full of light')
The Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.C.<D>) describes ç
several methods to attain calmness and steadiness of mind. (vide ç
1.33-39). One of them is to meditate on the su<218>umn<193>n<193><195><200>. ç
This results in a knowledge of the citta or one's mind. This knowledge, ç
being full of sattva, is compared to a jyoti or light (jyoti<218>mat<200> ç
= full of light). As a result, the yogi is able to transcend all sorrows.
@NT = Jyoti<218><219>oma
@N1 = (`praise of light')
Of the several types of Vedic sacrifices, the Jyoti<218><219>oma is ç
also one, belonging to the Soma group. Its standard form is the Agni<218><219>oma.
Stoma (= praise) is a form of chanting the stotras (<184>gvedic chants) ç
in which the verses are increased by repetition to a certain number. ç
So, a stoma is known by a number. For example: triv<216>t-stoma (three ç
fold or nine).
In the Jyoti<218><219>oma sacrifice, the four stomas that are chanted ç
are: triv<216>t, pa<210>cada·a, saptada·a and ekavi<221>·a. These ç
are called four jyotis or lights. Hence the name Jyoti<218><219>oma.
