Hindu India when attacked by thebarbarous aliens, met in its own ç
characteristic way, the challenges against its cherished values of ç
life, which it considered as eternal. This was done mainly by the ç
galaxy of great saints from all parts of India and from the innumerable ç
cults, groups and sects.
In this, the part played by the saints of Maharashtra was considerable.
Jan<193>rdana Sv<193>min was one such great saint.
Born in C<193>l<200>sg<193>v, a small village, in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1504, ç
Jan<193>rdana was given a good education not only in the scriptures ç
and secular sciences but also in the use of weapons, horse-riding ç
and statecraft.
He was married to two girls at an early age. After his parents died, ç
he took over the responsibilities of the family spending much of his ç
time in worldly pursuits. However one strange spiritual experience ç
in a temple where he had a vision of Datt<193>treya, changed the course ç
of his life completely. He received special instructions from a sage, ç
Narasi<221>ha Sarasvat<200>, in s<193>dhan<193> (spiritual practice) ç
under a sacred tree. He spent quite a fewdays there practising austerities ç
and meditation.
A Muslim Nav<193>b was the ruler of that area during those days. He ç
recognised Jan<193>rdana's great qualities and appointed him as the ç
commander of the fort. Jan<193>rdana, by his efficient administration ç
brought peace and prosperity to the people under his care.
He generally lived in Dh<193>re·vara in Devagiri and used to hold ç
his court there.
His biographers state that he would often visit a cave on the nearby ç
hill and have the dar·an (`seeing') of his chosen deity Datt<193>treya. ç
He had many disciples including the local Muslims and the Arabs.
Thursday was the day he had set apart for meditation and worship and ç
hence was not available for any work. Noticing this, the Muslim Nav<193>b ç
had declared Thursday as the weekly holiday for all governmental work.
Another great saint of Maharashtra, Ekn<193>th, was his chief disciple. ç
It was at his command that Ekn<193>th composed the Bh<193>gavata ç
in Mar<193><219>h<200> poetry.
Jan<193>rdana Sv<193>min had many psychic powers which he judiciously ç
used when necessary, to help others.
He  has  composed  quite  a  few abha<209>gas (devotional songs) which ç
are sung even today.
He passed away in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1575.

@NT = J<193>na·ruti
J<193>na·ruti was a king. He was the son of Jana·ruta and the grandson ç
of Putra. Hence he was known as Pautr<193>ya<207>a also.
This J<193>na·ruti Pautr<193>ya<207>a was well-known for his generosity, ç
especially forgiving food to the needy, through thenumerous free ç
kitchens all over his country.
One night, when he was resting on the terrace of his palace, he heard ç
the conversation between two swans which were flying over his head. ç
While one swan warned the other not to cross the brilliant light above ç
J<193>na·ruti's head lest it be harmed, the latter spoke derisively ç
of him, comparing him to the sage Raikva who was far superior to him.
J<193>na·ruti who was upset by this conversation between the birds, ç
sent his men in the morning to search for Raikva. They finally found ç
him sitting under a cart and scratching his skin affected by scabies.
When the king approached Raikva for spiritual wisdom, the sage taught ç
him what is known as Sa<221>vargavidy<193>.
This incident is described in the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad (4.1 ç
to 4.3.4).
The  same  story  appears  in  the Skandapur<193><207>a (Brahmakha<207><195>a†Setu-m<193>dhava ç
29) in a slightly different, but in a more detailed form. Here, the ç
birds are actually devar<218>is (sages from among the gods). Raikva ç
was so great that he had made all the sacred rivers stay in his hermitage ç
as three small lakes. When J<193>na·ruti approached him for spiritual ç
wisdom, he was asked to bathe in these lakes first. Then, his mind ç
became quiet and fit enough to receive the teaching. When Raikva taught ç
him spiritual wisdom, he attained liberation.

@NT = ja<209>gama
@N1 = (`that which moves')
In the philosophical literature, the word generally signifies living ç
beings. This whole world comprises two types of things: The sth<193>vara, ç
and the ja<209>gama, the stationary (non-moving, lifeless, material ç
objects) and the moving (living beings).
In the V<200>ra·aiva or Li<209>g<193>yata sect of <185>aivism, the ç
word has a special signi- ficance. It represents a saint, a man of ç
realisation who is `dynamic knowledge' or`personification of knowledge, ç
who is moving, who is living'.
The `ja<209>gama' is the third `<193>vara<207>a' (shield of protection) ç
out of the eight, specified in this sect.
A v<200>ra·aiva (follower of V<200>ra·aivism) is ordained to honor ç
a ja<209>gama even as he honours his guru (spiritual teacher) and ç
the li<209>ga (emblem of <185>iva given to him at the time of his ç
initiation).

the birthday of <185>r<200> <$IKrsna>K<216><218><207>a, is a proof ç
of this.
<185>r<200> <$IKrsna>K<216><218><207>a, like <185>r<200> <$IRama>R<193>ma, ç
<$IIncarnation>incarnation of Lord Vi<218><207>u, has been commanding ç
the love and affection, reverence and devotion, of millions of <$IHindu/s>Hindus ç
for millennia.
The problem of the historicity of <$IKrsna>K<216><218><207>a, discussed ç
by erudite scholars over the centuries, is not at all relevant to ç
our study and exposition of the <$IKrsna>K<216><218><207>a festival ç
here. If a `person' or a `personality' has succeeded in capturing ç
the psyche and ethos of an entire nation for numberless years, he ç
is certainly the maker and shaper of history and not just a poor historical ç
entity!
The birthday of <185>r<200> <$IKrsna>K<216><218><207>a, though mentioned ç

(associated with the <$IRohini>Rohi<207><200> <$INaksatra>nak<218>atra, ç
the 4th asterism, comprising five stars) is sometimes assigned to ç
the month <$IBhadrapada>Bh<193>drapada or even to other months and ç
dates, which may be assumed to refer to some older traditions. The ç
date given here (eighth day in the dark fortnight in the month of ç
<$ISravana><185>r<193>va<207>a, usually in August/September) is now ç
the universally accepted one.

and the <$IVrata/s>vrata is observed on the same day. Otherwise, it ç
is to be observed on the a<218><219>am<200> day only. If both are ç
spread over two days, the latter day is chosen for the observance.
Since <$IKrsna>K<216><218><207>a was born at midnight, the observance ç
of the <$IVrata/s>vrata commences at midnight. Fasting, keeping vigil ç
the whole night, worship of Lord <$IKrsna>K<216><218><207>a, repeating ç
or listening to the recitations from the <$IBhagavata>Bh<193>gavata ç

are the main items in the <$IJanmastami>Janm<193><218><219>am<200> ç
<$IVrata/s>vrata. The <$ISankalpa>sa<209>kalpa <$IMantra>mantra may ç
mention the reward one wants (if the <$IVrata/s>vrata is observed ç
as <$IKamya>k<193>mya or with desire) or it can be done for self-purification.
Some works giving more detailed instructions about the <$IVrata/s>vrata ç
advise the performer to devise a temporary <$ISutikagrha>s<220>tik<193>g<216>ha ç
or delivery room! This caters to the popular sentiments even as the ç
creche in <$IChristianity>Christianity does. The <$IPuja>p<220>j<193> ç
includes  the  performance  of  certain sacraments to be done at the ç
birth of a child like the <$IJatakarma>j<193>takarma, and <$INamakarana>n<193>makara<207>a ç
or the naming ceremony.
Generally, the <$IRohini>Rohi<207><200> <$INaksatra>nak<218>atra falls ç

<$IKrsna>K<216><218><207>a <$IJayanti>Jayant<200>. It may be observed ç
either as a <$IVrata/s>vrata or as an <$IUtsava>utsava, a festival, ç
the latter being the rule.
Coming to the social aspects of the celebrations: In some parts of ç
the country like <$IMaharashtra>Maharashtra, <$IBoys>boys and common ç
folk hang up pots full of curds and buttermilk, play underneath them, ç
and get drenched by the curds and buttermilk running out of the holes ç
made by the <$IBoys>boys, in typical <$IKrsna>K<216><218><207>a fashion! ç
In some of the South Indian homes, some of the eatables prepared for ç
the occasion, are hung on a frame at the top of the <$IMandapa>ma<207><195>apa ç
(temporary shrine structure) and distributed among the devotees, especially ç
the children, after the festivities.
The celebrations are held on a grand scale in all the <$IKrsna>K<216><218><207>a ç
<$ITemple>temples, especially the  ones  in  <$IVrindavan>V<216>nd<193>ban,  Mathur<193>  (in ç
Uttar Pradesh) and <$IDvaraka>Dv<193>rak<193> (in Gujarat). Processions ç

@NT = japa
@N1 = (`repetition [of the mantra]')
Japa has been an integral part of Hindu religious practices even from ç
the Vedic days. Ceremonial repetition of Vedic passages has been a ç
part and parcel of not only the Vedic sacrifices but also other, post-Vedic, ç
rituals.
Derived from the root-verb jap (`to utter') `japa' means uttering ç
or repetition of mantras (sacred passages or esoteric syllables or ç
the names of deities of the Hindu pantheon). The word is sometimes ç
defined as that which destroys sins and puts an end to rebirth (ja ç
= janman<193>·aka, destroyer of future birth; pa = p<193>pan<193>·aka, ç
destroyer of sins).
The Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (10.25) considers japa as one of the special ç
manifestations of the Lord.
The japa of a mantra can be practised in three different ways. When ç
it is uttered loudly it is `v<193>cika' or `vaikhar<200>'. If done ç
inaudibly (like whispering) it is `up<193><221>·u'. If done mentally ç
it is `m<193>nasika'.
@SPACE1 = 
@NID = There are several classifications of japa:
@NID = nityajapa†
@NK-1LS = that which is done regularly everyday like the G<193>yatr<200>japa.
@NID = naimittikajapa†
@NK-1LS = that which is done on special occasions like the periods ç
of eclipses or festivals like <185>ivar<193>tri.
@NID = k<193>myajapa†
@NK-1LS = that which is done for the fulfilment of desires like regaining ç
health or earning wealth.
@NID = pr<193>ya·cittajapa†
@NK-1LS = that which is done as an expiation for sins.
@NID = ajap<193>japa†
@NK-1LS = that in which the process of breathing is coupled with the ç
ha<221>sa-mantra (`so'ham ha<221>sa<199>'). This is called `ha<221>sajapa' ç
also.
@NID = vilomajapa†
@NK-1LS = that in which the mantra is repeated in the reverse order. ç
For e.g., repeating `namas' ·iv<193>ya' as `ya v<193> ··i ma na'. ç
This is generally done in countering black-magical rites.
@NID = likhitajapa†
@NK-1LS = that in which the mantra is written.
This is common even now. However, it should be done observing silence ç
and with devotion.
Japa should be practised in a clean and quiet place, sitting erect ç
on a comfortable seat. It should be done at a medium speed.
Before  beginning  the  japa  of  a mantra, the disciple is advised ç
to remember gratefully the <216><218>i (the original sage to whom ç
the mantra was revealed), the chandas (the meter) and the devat<193> ç
(the deity). This must be followed by ny<193>sas (ceremonial purification ç
of the hands and the limbs) and the dhy<193>na·loka (a verse that ç
describes the form of the deity). Afterthe japa is over, there must ç
be japasamarpa<207>a (offering the fruits of the japa to the deity ç
itself).
A japam<193>l<193> (rosary) can be used for counting. Counting can ç
be done on the fingers also.

@NT = japam<193>l<193>
@N1 = (`rosary, [usedfor]japa[or repetition of mantra]')
Repetition of a sacred formula or a divine name, especially in a ceremonial ç
manner, is a part and parcel of many a religious practice. Such repetition, ç
generally done mentally, is called `japa'. (See<MS>JAPA<D> for more ç
details.)
Japa must be practised, keeping the count, either on the fingers or ç
with a japam<193>l<193> (a rosary). Hindu scriptural works prescribe ç
many rules for its preparation and use.
Rudr<193>k<218>a (Elaescarpus ganitrus) beads, beads prepared out ç
of dried sticks of the tulas<200> (holy basil) plant or of dried wood ç
of bilva (Aegle marmolos), gold, certain precious stones (crystal ç
or quartz, coral, ruby, emerald and so on), beads of bhasma or dried ç
holy ash†these are the materials used for preparing the japa-m<193>l<193>s. ç
For stringing the beads, cotton or silk thread, wire of copper or ç
silver, are used.
The number of beads should be 108, or 54 (and rarely 27). Sometimes ç
it may be 64 or 32 also.
Japam<193>l<193>s   made   of   different materials  are  prescribed  for  different ç
mantras. For instance, the rudr<193>k<218>a beads are used by the ç
<185>aivas and <185><193>ktas who repeat mantras connected with <185>iva ç
or Dev<200>. M<193>l<193>s of tulas<200> beads are used by the worshippers ç
of Vi<218><207>u.
Sometimes different types of m<193>l<193>s are prescribed for getting ç
different results. If m<193>l<193>s of rudr<193>k<218>a beads can ç
give mok<218>a, those of pearls give competence in the knowledge of ç
all sciences.
Generally, one bead will be extra in a m<193>l<193> and that will ç
be strung separately so as to stand like a crown. This is called `meru'. ç
While counting, this meru should not be crossed. And, for counting ç
on the m<193>l<193>, the thumb should be used, supporting the m<193>l<193> ç
on the middle finger.

Jar<193>sandha   was   the   powerful monarch of the kingdom of Magadha ç
and a contemporary of K<216><218><207>a and the P<193><207><195>avas. ç
His capital was Girivraja.
B<216>hadratha, his father, had no issues for a long time. Once, at ç
his request, a sage, Ca<207><195>akau·ika by name, gave him a mango ç
sanctified by a mantra and asked him to give it to his wife. Since ç
B<216>hadratha had two wives, he cut the fruit into two halves and ç
gave a piece to each of them. Each gave birth to half a baby. Alarmed ç
at this grotesque turn, the two queens threw away the `babies'. Jar<193>, ç
an ogress who was searching for food, found the pieces and joined ç
them when they became a baby-boy. She took it to the king B<216>hadratha ç
who suitably rewarded her. Since the boy was `joined' (sandha or sandh<193>na) ç
by the lady Jar<193>, he came to be known as `Jar<193>sandha'.
After Jar<193>sandha became a strong young man, capable of taking ç
over the kingdom, B<216>hadratha crowned him and left for the forest ç
to live as a v<193>naprasthin (forest-recluse).
Jar<193>sandha'sdaughtershadbeen married to Ka<221>sa. Since Ka<221>sa ç
was killed by K<216><218><207>a, Jar<193>sandha became his bitter ç
enemy. His several invasions of Mathur<193> (the capital of K<216><218><207>a) ç
and attempts at killing him proved infructuous.
Being a worshipper of Bhairava (a terrible aspect of <185>iva), Jar<193>sandha ç
had imprisoned a large number of princes from other kingdoms with ç
a view to sacrificing them to his deity. When K<216><218><207>a got ç

@NT = Ja<219><193>yu
There are not many persons in the history of the world who were prepared ç
to fight and lay down their lives for dharma or righteousness. And, ç
Ja<219><193>yu the bird-hero, is a glorious and inspiring example ç
that we come across in that immortal epic, the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
of V<193>lm<200>ki.
As per the details given in the Mah<193>bh<193>rata (°diparva ç
67) he and Sa<221>p<193>ti (his elder brother) were the sons of Aru<207>a ç
and <185>yeni. (Aru<207>a was the sonof Vinat<193> and Ka·yapa, and ç
the elder brother of Garu<195>a, the bird-mount of Lord Vi<218><207>u.)
Once Samp<193>ti and Ja<219><193>yu flew to great heights towards ç
the sun to test their flying powers. Since Ja<219><193>yu was getting ç
exhausted by the hot rays of the sun, Samp<193>ti spread his wings ç
over him to protect him but got his own wings burnt as a result, and ç
fell down. Ja<219><193>yu started living in the Da<207><195>aka forest, ç
but did not know the whereabouts of his brother.
When R<193>ma came to the Pa<210>cava<219><200> area of the forest, ç
to live there, Ja<219><193>yu introduced himself as the friend of ç
his father Da·aratha. At R<193>ma's request, Ja<219><193>yu started ç
living in the nearby area.
When R<193>va<207>a was abducting S<200>t<193>, Ja<219><193>yu ambushed ç
him, fought with him fiercely to rescue S<200>t<193> but died in the ç
effort.
R<193>ma, searching for S<200>t<193>, came across the dying Ja<219><193>yu, ç
got some information about S<200>t<193> and her abductor and performed ç
his last rites after his death.

@NT = j<193>ti
@N1 = (`that which comes by birth')
@EMERGENCY = In the Indian philosophical systems, categorisation of ç
things is an important item of discussion. One such is `s<193>m<193>nya' ç
or `j<193>ti'. It indicates the common quality of a number of things ç
which are similar in certain respects.
@EMERGENCY = For instance, in a number of cows, which may appear to ç
be different in size, colour or other features, there is a common ç
quality, which can be called `gotva-j<193>ti' or `cowness' which comes ç
to them by birth (=j<193>ti).
@EMERGENCY = In the Ny<193>ya system of philosophy the word `j<193>ti' ç
is used in the technical sense of `futility' (vide Ny<193>yas<220>tras ç
1.2.18). It means an unfair reply based on a false analogy. It consists ç
of basing a futile argument on any kind of similarity or dissimilarity ç
between two things to controvert another sound argument.
For instance: If one argues, `Sound is non-eternal, because it is ç
an effect like a pot,' and another person objects to it saying that ç
sound must be eternal, because it is incorporeal like the sky, this ç
objection is a kind of j<193>ti since there is no universal relation ç
between the incorporeal and the eternal.
As for j<193>ti or caste, see <MS>CASTE<D> <MS>SYSTEM.<D>
@NT = j<193>tij<210><193>na
@N1KERN = (`knowledge of [previous] births')
A yogi develops extraordinary powers by `sa<221>yama' or sam<193>dhi ç
(perfect concentration) preceded by dh<193>ra<207><193> (fixing the ç
mind on an object) and dhy<193>na (continuous meditation). If he practises ç
sa<221>yama on his own sa<221>sk<193>ras or residual potencies of ç
his mind, he will get a direct knowledge of his previous births or ç
lives (j<193>ti = birth, j<210><193>na = knowledge) because these ç
sa<221>sk<193>ras have been caused by the experiences in those lives ç
(vide Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali 3.18).
@NT = J<193>t<220>kar<207>ya
The dharma·<193>stra literature is very vast. Many writers quote the ç
earlier writers as authorities to support their own views. One such ç
ancient author is J<193>t<220>kar<207>ya (also spelt as J<193>t<220>kar<207>i ç
or J<193>t<220>kar<207>a). He perhaps lived earlier than the 3rd century ç
<MS>A.<|>D.<D>
J<193>t<220>kar<207>ya has been quoted (in verses as also in prose) ç
by Vi·var<220>pa (9th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>), in the Mit<193>k<218>ar<193> ç
of Vij<210><193>ne·vara (12th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>), Haradatta (circa ç
<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1100-1300), Apar<193>rka (12th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) ç
and others.
Some of the views attributed to him are: a pupil should not suddenly ç
put questions to his teacher in an assembly; prohibition of marrying ç
another wife of a lower caste when already having one wife of one's ç
own caste; pr<193>ya·citta for a boy before upanayana, for accidentally ç
drinking liquor and so on.
His work (not available now) was probably in the form of s<220>tras ç
and musthave dealt with subjects like <193>c<193>ra (conduct), ·r<193>ddha ç
(obsequial rites), some sacrifices and some aspects of astrology.
@NT = J<193>va
Hindu religion and culture started spreading to the various islands ç
of South East Asia even from the first century <MS>A.D.<D> Some of ç
the kings of South India who were defeated by their rivals, migrated ç
to the islands like J<193>va and established their own kingdoms there.
Known as Yavadv<200>pa, probably from the 10th cent. <MS>A.<|>D.<D>, ç
J<193>va was the home of well-known dynasties of kings like <185>r<200>vijaya ç
R<193>ja.
The work Aji·aka states that during the first century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>, ç
twenty thousand people from Kali<209>ga (Orissa, India) came and settled ç
down in the island of J<193>va.
A very large number of Hindu scriptu-ral works in Sanskrit (excepting ç
the Vedas) written in the Kawi script have been discovered. The following ç

Apart from these there is the famous R<193>m<193>ya<207>a Kakawin ç
in old Javanese. Works on medicines, astrology, stories and literary ç
classics and history works have also been found. The R<193>makavaca ç

@NT = Jaya
@EMERGENCY = Jaya and Vijaya†the twins†are two interesting personalities ç
we come across in the pur<193><207>as dedicated to the Vi<218><207>u ç
cult. They were the children of the sage Kardama and his wife Devah<220>ti.
@EMERGENCY = Being great devotees of Vi<218><207>u, they used to have ç
the vision of Lord Vi<218><207>u regularly at the time of worship.
@EMERGENCY = Once they conducted a Vedic sacrifice of the king Marutta ç
admirably well. However, differences arose between them as regards ç
the sharing of the wealth and fees that they had earned. This lead ç
to their mutually cursing each other. Jaya became an elephant and ç
Vijaya, a crocodile. They were the two, involved in the story of Gajendramok<218>a ç
(See <MS>GAJENDRA<D>). After both were liberated from the curses they ç
were taken as dv<193>rap<193>lakas (gate keepers) of Vaiku<207><219>ha, ç
the world of Vi<218><207>u.
@EMERGENCY = On another occasion, they rudely prevented the great ç
sages†Sanaka and others†from entering the Vaiku<207><219>ha and were ç
cursed by them. As a result they had to be born as the demons Hira<207>y<193>k<218>a ç
and Hira<207>yaka·ipu, R<193>va<207>a and Kumbha-kar<207>a, and, <185>i·up<193>la ç
and Dantavakra. In all these births, they were killed by Lord Vi<218><207>u ç
himself and liberated from the curse. Later they continued their service ç
as the gatekeepers of Lord Vi<218><207>u.
@NT = Jayadeva
One of the most popular Sanskrit poets of all time, whose G<200>tagovindak<193>vya ç
has made him immortal in the annals of Indian literature, Jayadeva, ç
was born in the village Kendubilva or Kend<220>li of Bengal as the ç
son of Bhojadeva and R<193>m<193>dev<200>. He is assigned to the 12th ç
century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>,  the  exact  date  being unknown. He was one ç
of the five court-poets of the king Lak<218>ma<207>asena of Bengal.
Though not much is known of him, legends abound in attributing many ç
mira-culous happenings to his life. Some of them are: acceptance of ç
his work, the G<200>ta- govinda by Lord Jagann<193>tha in preference ç
to the king's own work; marriage with Padm<193>vat<200> at the behest ç
of Lord K<216><218><207>a; regaining his limbs that had been cut off ç
by robbers, their destruction and redemption on Jayadeva's intervention; ç
death of Padm<193>vat<200> on hearing the (false) news of Jayadeva's ç
demise and subsequent revival by the Lord's grace and so on.
Jayadeva's works are: G<200>tagovinda, K<193>rakav<193>da, Ratima<210>jar<200> ç
and Tattvacint<193>-ma<207>i.
He is said to have composed a Mah<193>bh<193>rata in Hindi, closely ç
following the original by Vy<193>sa.
One more Jayadeva (also of the 12th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>), a br<193>hma<207>a ç
belonging to Vidarbha (in Maharashtra), is also known to the historians ç
of Sanskrit literature. Two  works  are  attributed  to  him: Prasannar<193>ghava ç
(a drama of seven scenes depicting the story of the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a); ç
Candr<193>loka (a scholarly work on ala<209>k<193>ra·<193>stra or ç
poetics, in ten chapters, comprising 350 stanzas).
The latter work is considered as an authority on poetics. Appayyad<200>k<218>ita ç
(16th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) has written a commentary on it called ç
Kuvalay<193>nanda.
@NT = Jay<193>khya Sa<221>hit<193>
The Vai<218><207>av<193>gamas have branched off into two streams: ç
The P<193><210>car<193>tra and the Vaikh<193>nasa.
Between these two, the former has produced a voluminous literature†more ç
than two hundred works†and is also being followed in most of the Vai<218><207>ava ç
temples, especially in South India.
The three most important treatises of this school are: The Ahirbudhnya ç
Sa<221>hit<193>, the Jay<193>khya Sa<221>hit<193> and the S<193>ttvata ç
Sa<221>hit<193>.
The Jay<193>khya Sa<221>hit<193> is a large work of 4592 verses ç
(in the anu<218><219>ubh metre) spread over 33 pa<219>alas or chapters. ç
It was perhaps composed between <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 300 and 600. 
A significant aspect of this treatise is that it gives a detailed ç
account of the philosophy of the P<193><210>car<193>tra system. (See<MS>P°<178>CAR°TRA ç
°GAMAS<D>.)
A very brief summary of its contents may now be given here:
@S10N = Chapter 1 (166 verses)
@EMERGENCY = This is an introductory chapter and deals with the paratattva ç
or the highest Truth. It starts with the conversation between the ç
sages Sa<221>vartaka and Aurva and later, <185><193><207><195>ilya. ç
The qualifications of the guru who is competent to give the spiritual ç
wisdom, as also those of the disciple fit to receive it, are set forth.
@S10N = Chapter 2 (75 verses)
This chapter deals with Brahmasarga or the creation of the four-faced ç
Brahm<193> from the navel-lotus of Lord Vi<218><207>u, creation of ç
the world by him, the story of the demons Madhu and Kai<219>abha and ç
their being killed by the Lord Vi<218><207>u, as also the recovery ç
of the Vedas.
@S10N = Chapter 3 (28 verses)
This is a small section dealing with the creation from the pradh<193>na, ç
comprising the three well-known gu<207>as, and the association of ç

out of himself, three subsidiary forms and some details about them.
@S10N = Chapter 5 (46 verses)
@EMERGEN1 = It is very difficult to know Brahman or God. However, ç
the practice of yoga and meditation, along with mantrajapa (repetition ç
of the divine name) will be of great help, which, of course, has to ç
be learnt from a competent preceptor. This is the gist of this chapter.
@S10N = Chapter 6 (250 verses)
@EMERGEN1 = This chapter is primarily devoted to the expounding of ç
the m<220>lamantra (basic mantra of N<193>r<193>ya<207>a) along with ç
many other related mantras such as those of Lak<218>m<200> (spouse ç
of N<193>r<193>ya<207>a), Jay<193>, M<193>y<193>, mantras for purifying ç
one's limbs, mantras of N<216>si<221>ha (man-lion incarnation of Vi<218><207>u) ç

like Ananta, K<220>rma, K<218>etrap<193>la, <185>r<200>, Ga<207>e·a, ç
Matsya, V<193>g<200>·var<200> and Vi<218>vaksena. These mantras should ç
be formally received from a qualified guru and should be kept a secret.
@S10N = Chapter 8 (117 verses)
This part of the work describes several mudr<193>s (poses of hand) ç
such as jaya, ·akti, h<216>daya, astra, kapila and so on. Fifty mudr<193>s ç

As against the internal or mental worship described in the last chapter, ç
this chapter deals with b<193>hyay<193>ga or external worship.
The various steps detailed here are: drawing the ma<207><195>ala (esoteric ç
drawing), establishing the kumbha (pitcher of water), arghya (water ç
for washing hands), worship of the deity Ga<207>e·a, meditations on ç
various deities, offering of dh<220>pa (incense), ringing of bell, ç
inviting the deity, worship and chanting of hymns.
@S10N = Chapter 14 (94 verses)
@EMERGENCY = This part of the work is devoted entirely to japa (repetition ç
of the divine name) and the ak<218>as<220>tra or japam<193>l<193> ç
(rosary), including the methods of preparing it.
@S10N = Chapter 15 (264 verses)

described here.
Some of the important items given in this section are: examining the ç
competence of the disciple, days auspicious for giving d<200>k<218><193>, ç
purifying the articles to be used in the ritual of d<200>k<218><193>, ç
establishing the kala·a (pot filled with water and other materials ç
as prescribed), homa, praying to the deity to be present there, giving ç
a new name to the disciple, some rites connected with the imparting ç
of the mantra, worship of the deity in and through the consecrated ç

investiture withthe sacred thread, of the images of gods, holy pots ç
(kala·as), the y<193>ga·<193>l<193> (sacrificial shed) and so on. ç

performance.
@S10N = Chapter 22 (80 verses)
This section is dedicated entirely to the description of the characteristics ç
and codes of conduct of the Vai<218><207>avas or devotees of Vi<218><207>u. ç

@S10N = Chapter 23 (155 verses)
This chapter deals with the topic of ·r<193>ddha (obsequial ceremonies) ç
in all its details.
@S10N = Chapter 24 (104 verses)
A topic allied to the previous section, viz., after-death ceremonies, ç
is discussed here.
They are purificatory and other rites for a dead person's body, preparation ç
of the funeral pyre, cremation, purificatory bath, collection of bones ç
later on, rules concerning the disposal of the body of a yati (monk), ç
and the rites for a person who dies elsewhere and whose body is not ç
recovered.
@S10N = Chapter 25 (159 verses)
The various pr<193>ya·cittas or expiatory rites for faults and sins†of ç
omission and commission†are described here. Some of the misdeeds mentioned ç
are: not performing the daily rituals like the sandhy<193>- vandana, ç
killing of a br<193>hma<207>a or a cow, drinking liquor, stealing, ç
eating the food offered by grave sinners, accepting prohibited gifts, ç
abusing respectable persons, defiling places of worship and so on.
@S10N = Chapter 26 (133 verses)

@N1 = (`birthdays')
Most of us live in this world in such a way that very soon we are ç
consigned to history. But there are a few, who are the `salt of the ç
earth' who create history! It is but natural for the posterity to ç
remember them with gratitude and pay their homage, especially on their ç
birthdays.
One of the prominent characteristics of the <$IHindu/s>Hindu race ç
is hero-worship, especially if they are religious or spiritual persons. ç
Hence, the number of such birthdays celebrated in our country by the ç
<$IHindu/s>Hindus is legion. Out of that, only a few can be mentioned ç
here since they are, comparatively speaking, a little more known than ç
the others.
First comes the celebration of the <$IJayanti>jayant<200>s of the ç
<$IAvatara>avat<193>ras, especially the Da·<193>vat<193>ras. Since ç
most of the <$IAvatara>avat<193>ras are <$IMythical>mythical personalities ç
and a few of them are of the non-human form, the only data that is ç
available and has to be relied upon, is the one provided by the <$IPurana>pur<193><207>as. ç
The usual dates of these jayant<200>s are:

The village Jayar<193>mb<193><219><200> is situated in the Bankura ç
district of West Bengal, 117 kms. (73 miles) to the west of the metropolis ç
Calcutta (now Kolkata). It has now become a place of pilgrimage since ç
it is the birth place of S<193>rad<193>dev<200> (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1853-1920), ç
the divine consort of <185>r<200> R<193>mak<216><218><207>a Paramaha<221>sa, ç
who is being worshipped as an incarnation of God by millions of devotees ç
all over the world.
The chief attraction of the place is the temple dedicated to her, ç
built on the spot where she was born, containing a beautiful marble ç
image of hers. The original shrine was built in <MS>A.<|>D. <D>1923 ç
and expanded later in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1954, adding a prayer hall as ç
also installing the marble image.
Apart from preserving the old structures associated with her life, ç
the Rama-krishna Math and Mission which is now in charge of the temple, ç
is conducting several rural welfare programmes like running schools ç
and a dispensary.
The following are some of the places the devotee-pilgrims normally ç
visit: the old and the new houses (huts) where S<193>rad<193>dev<200> ç
lived; the bathing gh<193><219> at the rivulet °modar; the temple ç
of goddess Si<221>hav<193>hin<200> the mud at which place is said ç

@SPACE = 
The chief adversary of the Advaita Ved<193>nta of <185>a<209>kara ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 788-820) has been the Dvaita Ved<193>nta propounded ç
by Madhva (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1238-1317). One of the topmost exponents ç
of this system was Jayat<200>rtha.
His premonastic name was Dho<207><195><220>pant. He was born in the ç
small town Ma<209>galave<195>e situated on the border of Karnataka ç
and Maharashtra. His father was Raghun<193>tha R<193>ya of the De·ap<193><207><195>e ç
lineage. Since the family was rich and also had political patronage, ç
Dho<207><195><220>pant grew up as a carefree young man. However, one ç
encounter with Ak<218>obhyat<200>rtha, a sa<221>ny<193>sin disciple ç
of Madhv<193>c<193>rya, changed hislife completely. He then and there ç
renounced the world and took to monastic life with the new name Jayat<200>rtha.
After a course of training under this able teacher, Jayat<200>rtha ç
gradually excelled him. His works on the Dvaita Ved<193>nta philosophy ç
are:
@SPACE1 = 
Ny<193>yasudh<193> (a commentary on the Anuvy<193>khy<193>na of ç
Madhva, which itself is a commentary on the Brahmas<220>tras);
Tattvaprak<193>·ik<193> (a commentary on the Brahmas<220>trabh<193><218>ya ç

Ny<193>yad<200>pik<193> (a commentary on the G<200>t<193>t<193>tparyanir<207>aya ç

Jayat<200>rtha was a contemporary of Vidy<193>ra<207>ya, the well-known ç
teacher and writer on the Advaita philosophy and the founder of the ç
Vijayanagara empire.
He passed away on the bank of the river K<193>gi<207><200>, in Ma<202>akhe<195>a ç
(or M<193>nya-khe<219>a).

J<200>m<220>tav<193>hana is one of the three most important writers ç

(<MS>A.<D><|><MS>D.<D> 1365-1445) and Raghu- nandana (<MS>A.<D><|><MS>D.<D> ç
1510-1580). He was a scion of the P<193>ribhadr<200>ya br<193>hma<207>a ç
family, had the title `Mah<193>mahop<193>dhy<193>ya' and was the chief ç
judge under the king Vi<218>vaksena of Bengal.
Three works of his have come to light. They are: Vyavah<193>ram<193>t<216>k<193>, ç
K<193>laviveka and D<193>yabh<193>ga.
The Vyavah<193>ram<193>t<216>k<193> deals with judicial procedures ç
like titles of law, fitness needed for appointing a person as a judge, ç
different grades of courts, four stages of vyavah<193>ra, divine and ç
human proofs and so on.
The K<193>laviveka discusses about the appropriate seasons and months ç
for the performance of religious rites and duties and other allied ç
subjects.
The D<193>yabh<193>ga is the most famous of his works. Matters concerning ç
inheritance, partition, str<200>dhana (a woman's share and property), ç
reunion and other related subjects are discussed in detail. There ç
seem to be at least a dozen commentaries on this work.

@N1 = (`individual soul')
Derived  from  the  root-verb  `j<200>v' (`having life') the word ç
`j<200>va' means any living being. However, in the Indian philo- sophical ç
systems the words j<200>va and j<200>v<193>t- man represent the individual ç
soul inbondage, subject to the cycle of transmigration.
@SPACE1 = 
There are differences among the various systems as regards the nature ç
and number of the j<200>vas. If the advaita system considers the j<200>va ç
as vibhu or all-pervading and ultimately identical with Brahman, other ç
systems consider it as a<207>u or atomic in size, infinite in number ç
and completely different from Brahman.
In the state of bondage, the j<200>va has three ·ar<200>ras or bodies ç
(sth<220>la·ar<200>ra or gross body, li<209>ga or s<220>k<218>ma·ar<200>ra ç
or subtle body and k<193>ra<207>a·ar<200>ra or causal body), five ç

@NT = j<200>vanmukti
@N1 = (`liberation [even] while<R>ç
living')
The scriptures of Ved<193>nta accept twotypes of mukti or liberation ç
from transmigratory existence: j<200>vanmukti and videhamukti.
When a person attains <193>tmaj<210><193>na or direct experience of ç
one's true nature as the <193>tman or the Self, he is liberated from ç
future births. Hence he is a `mukta'. However, since the pr<193>rabdhakarma ç
that started the present body is still there, he continues to live, ç
with all the experiences brought about by that karma. But his reactions ç
to the experiences are now completely different since he has known ç
from his mystic experience that he is the pure spirit and not the ç
material body in which he has temporarily made his abode. Such a person ç
is called a `j<200>vanmukta,' one who is liberated even while living ç
in the body.
@SPACE1 = 
When  the  pr<193>rabdhakarma  gets exhausted and the body falls, ç
he attains `videhamukti' (liberation from all bodies including the ç
present one) which is like a river entering into an ocean and losing ç
its identity.
