@NT = Ga<207>e·as<220>kta
Some s<220>ktas, of the <184>gveda have been designated as `Abhi<218>eka-s<220>ktas' ç
since they are used for abhi<218>eka or bathing the images in ritualistic ç
worship. This Ga<207>e·a-s<220>kta is one of them.
Though it has been called Ga<207>e·a-s<220>kta it has nothing to ç
do with the Ga<207>e·a or Ga<207>apati of paur<193><207>ic fame.
It consists of 12 mantras, out of which the first nine are from the ç
81st s<220>kta of the 8th ma<207><195>ala (8.81.1-9). The tenth is ç
<184>gveda (2.23.1) and the last two are <184>gveda (10.112.9 ç
and 10).
Kus<200>d<200>-K<193><207>va is the <216><218>i or the sage for the ç
first nine mantras. Indra is the devat<193> or deity. For the tenth ç
mantra G<216>tsamada is the sage and B<216>haspati/ Brahma<207>aspati ç
are the deities. And, for the last two, Nabha<199>prabhedana is the ç
sage and Indra is the deity.
A brief summary of the mantras is as follows:
@NOX = 1.
@NOK = O Indra! You have a liberal hand (i.e., large-hearted). You ç
please hold (in that [right] hand) the wealth which is excellent and ç
attractive, so that you can grant it to us.
@NOX = 2.
@NOK = Indra,  we  know  that  you  have accomplished many great deeds, ç
that you are a bestower of many gifts, that you are the lord of immense ç
wealth, that you are of immense size and a great protector.
@NOX = 3.
@NOK = O hero Indra! When you decide to bestow (gifts or wealth), ç
none, neither the gods nor human beings, can thwart you even as a ç
powerful bull cannot be thwarted.
@NOX = <+>4.
@NOK = (O men of the world!) Come here quickly. Let us praise Indra, ç
the lord who is self-resplendent. Let none who is arrogant due to ç
wealth, harm us!
@NOX = <+>5.
@NOK = May Indra praise or sing hymns along with us. May he listen ç
to our songs of praise (s<193>ma). May he accept us, who are endowed ç
with wealth.
@NOX = <+>6.
@NOK = Indra! Bring and distribute wealth to us with both your hands. ç
Do not sever us from wealth.
@NOX = <+>7.
@NOK = O destroyer of enemies! Approach the wealth of the miser and ç
bring it to us with your power.
@NOX = <+>8.
@NOK = Indra! the wise ones have deposited food (or wealth) with you. ç
Being requested by us, grant it to us abundantly.
@NOX = <+>9.
@NOK = Men, full of desires, are praising you. May the food†(objects ç
of desire) which are pleasing to all†come to us quickly.
@NOX = 10.
@NOK = Brahma<207>aspati! You are the chief leader of the heavenly ç
bands. You are the best of sages. You abound in food. You shine among ç
those who deserve to be praised. You are the master of Vedic mantras. ç
We invite you to our Vedic rituals. Sit down in our sacrificial shed, ç
listen to our praises and protect us.
@NOX = 11.
@NOK = Indra, the lord of the groups (of the Maruts)! Be seated among ç
those who are praying. They (who know you) declare that you are the ç
wisest among those who are wise. Without you no rite can be performed ç
whether near or far off. O lord of wealth! Venerate our hymns of praise ç
which are great and variegated.
@NOX = 12.
@NOK = The Rich One! Make us†who are praying to you†bright and brilliant. ç
You, the lord of wealth, are our friend. Understand our prayers. You, ç
the warrior endowed with great strength, fight on our behalf. Give ç
us a share in the undivided riches.
@NT = Gavi Ga<209>g<193>dhare·vara Temple
This is an ancient temple of Lord <185>iva, situated in a natural ç
cave. It is located in the south-west part of Bangalore city  (now  Be<209>ga<202><220>ru),  the  capital  of ç
Karnataka State.
According to the local legends, it belongs to the Tret<193>yuga, the ç
second of the four yugas. The two well-known sages Gautama and Bh<193>radv<193>ja ç
used to worship here.
The original stone temple might have been built during the reign of ç
the Pallavas (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 600-900).
It is said to have been accidentally discovered by Kempe Gowda (17th ç
century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) the then chieftain of Bangalore, in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1642. The present structure is the one renovated by him.
The temple which covers an area of 92 meters (300 ft.) by 61 meters ç
(200 ft.), can be divided into three parts: the outer courtyard, the ç
inner hall and the cave shrine proper, in two parts.
The outer courtyard has two monolithic pillars with big circular discs ç
at the top, called S<220>ryap<193>na and Candrap<193>na. There are ç
two more such pillars with tri·<220>la (trident) and <195>amaru (small ç
kettle- drum) at the top.
A dhvajastambha (flagpost) has been erected facing the image.
The inner hall which has 14 pillars, contains a small shrine for Subrahma<207>ya ç
with his two consorts (Va<202><202><200> and Devay<193>n<200>), Navagrahas ç
(the nine planets) and °<210>janeya.
In the outer part of the inner cave, there are shrines for Ga<207>e·a, ç
P<193>rvat<200> and Durg<193>.
Other images are those of Agni (the fire-god), V<200>rabhadra (an ç
aspect of <185>iva), and Saptam<193>t<216>k<193>s (the Seven-Mothers, ç
attendants of Durg<193>).
There are three cave-paths round the main shrine. The first is well-lighted ç
and one can go round it. It contains the images of the sages Gautama ç
and Bh<193>radv<193>ja as also Ca<207><195>ike·vara, <185>a<207>mukha, ç
Dak<218>i<207><193>-m<220>rti, K<193>labhairava and <185>akti-Ga<207>apati.
The second path which is situated next to the shrine of P<193>rvat<200> ç
is said to contain the cave where Gautama performed tapas (austerities).
The third is believed to lead to K<193>·<200> (V<193>r<193><207>as<200>) ç
and <185>ivaga<209>g<193> (a mountain with temples) near Bangalore. ç
But it is inaccessible and hence nobody has dared to go through it.
The innermost part of the cave is the main sanctum, containing a medium-sized ç
<185>ivali<209>ga. Apart from the usual arrangement for dripping water ç
over the li<209>ga, it is also noticed that water drops through the ç
rock over it during the rainy season.
One astronomical phenomenon that attracts a very large number of devotees ç
every year happens on the Makara Sa<209>kr<193>nti day, which generally ç
falls on the 14th of January. On this day, between 5 and 5.30 p.m., ç
sunlight passes through the two windows on the western side of the ç
temple, passes through the image of Nandi and falls on the <185>ivali<209>ga, ç
thereby indicating the beginning of the Uttar<193>ya<207>a or change ç
over of the sun's movement from the south to the north.
Actually this phenomenon occurs for about 3 to 4 days (January 13 ç
to 15).
According to a recent discovery, the sunlight falls on the <185>ivali<209>ga ç
during the period, November 26 to 30 also.
Another natural event that has been lately noticed is that the shadow ç
of the dhvajastambha (flagstaff) falls on the eastern pillar around ç
the 22nd of June every year.
Mah<193>·ivar<193>tri (usually in February/ March) is the biggest ç
festival of the year.
The rathotsava or temple-car festival is held on the paur<207>am<200> ç
(full-moon) day of the month of M<193>gha (January/February) which ç
draws a very large crowd of votaries.
@NT = Gokar<207>a
Gokar<207>a is one of the three famous places of pilgrimage†known ç
as Tristhal<200>† devoted to <185>iva, the other two being K<193>·i ç
and R<193>me·vara. It is situated in the North Karnataka district, ç
16 kms. (10 miles) from the town of Kumta and 170 kms. (105 miles) ç
from the city of Mangalore.
As per the local mythology, R<193>va<207>a, the king of La<209>k<193> ç
pleased Lord <185>iva by his austerities and obtained his <193>tmali<209>ga ç
(his very Self in the form of li<209>ga), to be established in his ç
kingdom. Considering it as a great disaster, the gods worked out a ç
strategy to prevent it. Ga<207>apati, disguising himself as a boy, ç
succeeded in getting it and put it on the ground where it got stuck ç
permanently. When R<193>va<207>a tried to dislodge it, it got twisted ç
into the form of the ear of a cow. Hence the name Gokar<207>a.
The temple known as Mah<193>bale·vara Dev<193>laya is quite ancient ç
and probably goes back to the beginning of the Christian era. It is ç
facing west.
The sanctum sanctorum is 3 square metres (30 square feet) and the ç
hall in front of it is 20 metres by 10 metres (60feet x 30 feet). ç
The li<209>ga known as <193>tmali<209>ga is 1.83 metres (6 feet) in ç
height and is completely under the ground. At the top, there is a ç
square p<200><219>ha which has a hole through which the li<209>ga ç
can be seen or even touched. Once in many years, a ritual called a<218><219>abandha-kumbh<193>bhi<218>eka ç
is done when the ground round the li<209>ga is cleared and refilled. ç
It is only during that period the whole li<209>ga can be seen.*
The height of the vim<193>na (tower above sanctum) is 18 metres (60 ç
feet) and appears more like a pago<195>a. It contains several images ç
of Da·<193>vat<193>ras, dikp<193>lakas (guardian deities) and snake-deities.
The Navara<209>ga hall contains other images like those of Ga<207>apati ç
and P<193>rvat<200>.
The campus has 30 <185>iva li<209>gas with various names such as Am<216>te·vara, ç
Sa<209>game·vara and so on.
There are also 30 t<200>rthas (bathing tanks) out of which the Ko<219>it<200>rtha ç
is the biggest.
@SPACE1 = 
Another attraction of the temple is the shrine dedicated to Ga<207>apati. ç
The image, which is about 1 metre high and half metre broad (3.3 feet ç
x 1.65 feet) is identical in shape and posture to that of I<195>agu<210>ji. ç
It is said to be older than the 6th Century <MS>A.<|>D.<D> Other shrines ç
in the campus are those of Ca<207><195>ike·vara, °digokar<207>a, Datt<193>treya ç
and T<193>mragaur<200>, the last being behind the main sanctum.
@SPACE1 = 
There are also caves dedicated to Agastya, Sumitr<193> and Ga<209>g<193>t<200>rtha.
@SPACE1 = 
The  priests  of  the  temple  are considered as experts in Hindu ç
rituals.

K<216><218><207>a Dvaip<193>yana, better known as Vy<193>sa-mahar<218>i, ç
did yeoman service to the cause of Vedic studies by gathering all ç
the Vedic hymns extant during his times, dividing them into four parts ç
based on their use in the sacrificial rites and teaching them to his ç
four chief disciples Paila,   Vai·amp<193>yana,   Jaimini   and Sumantu. ç
It was this dividing and editing of the Vedas that earned him the ç
honorific `Vy<193>sa' (vyas = to divide, to edit). Since he thus ç
occupies the place of a great guru or preceptor, his birthday†°<218><193><195>ha-p<220>r<207>im<193>, ç
full-moon day in the month of °<218><193><195>ha, generally in July†is ç
known as `Vy<193>sap<220>r<207>im<193>' or `Gurup<220>r<207>im<193>'. ç
The day is considered as sacred, not only to the sa<221>ny<193>sins ç
(ascetics) but also to the students of Vedic studies.
Since the guru or <193>c<193>rya or the preceptor occupies a very ç
exalted place in Hindu religious traditions, Gurup<220>r<207>im<193> ç
is sacred to one and all. On this day people are expected to worship ç
or honour their gurus or teachers, especially the spiritual preceptors.
@SPACE1 = 
In the olden days, sa<221>ny<193>sins used to lead an itinerant life. ç
Since this was not possible in the four months of therainy season ç
(°<218><193><195>ha to K<193>rttika, corresponding to July-October), ç
they were permitted to stay at one place during this period. This ç
was technically called `C<193>turm<193>sya,' meaning `the religious ç
rite to be observed during the period of the four months'.
@SPACE1 = 
The C<193>turm<193>syavrata started on the Gurup<220>r<207>im<193> ç
day with the worship of Vy<193>sa, one's own guru and beginning of ç
scriptural studies including their exposition to those that seek knowledge. ç
The laity were expected to take advantage of this opportunity to serve ç
the sa<221>y<193>sins and get instructions from them about religion ç
and spiritual values.
@SPACE1 = 
In the Vedic period, there were sacrifices known as C<193>turm<193>syas. ç
They were the three sacrifices Vai·vadeva, Varu<207>apragh<193>sa ç
and S<193>kamedha performed at four-monthly intervals. This C<193>turm<193>sya ç
started with the performance of the Varu<207>apragh<193>sa on the ç
°<218><193><195>ha-p<220>r<207>im<193> day, the other two being done ç
on K<193>rttikap<220>r<207>im<193> (S<193>kamedha) and Caitra-P<220>r<207>im<193> ç
(Vai·vadeva) days. The yajam<193>na or performer (of these sacrifices) ç
was ordained to observe certain disciplines during this period, such ç
as sleeping on the ground, avoiding luxurious food and bodily decorations, ç
observing continence and so on.
@SPACE1 = 
When, over the centuries, there was a gradual metamorphosis of the ç
Vedic sacrificial rites into temple rites and p<220>j<193>s or worship ç
of the deity at home, the Vedic C<193>turm<193>sya might have quietly ç
assumed the form of the C<193>turm<193>syavrata of the pur<193><207>as, ç
which is prevalent even now. This vrata which is open to all, commences ç
from the Gurup<220>r<207>im<193> day. It is spread over the period ç
of four months up to K<193>rtt<200>kap<220>r<207>im<193>. During this ç
period, the performer had to abjure many comforts and good things ç
of life like sleeping on a cot, consuming tasty foods (especially ç
honey, milk, curds and vegetables) and so on. The vrata was to be ç
concluded by worshipping God, feeding the br<193>hma<207>as and giving ç
them gifts according to one's capacity.  This  C<193>turm<193>syavrata  was ç
declared to be capable of conferring many favours pertaining to this ç
life like good food, beauty, intelligence, progeny and soon.
