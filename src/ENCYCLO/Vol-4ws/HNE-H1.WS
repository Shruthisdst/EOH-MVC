@SPACE = 
Whether Hanum<193>n†also known as M<193>ruti and °<210>janeya†was ç
a historical personality or not, there is no doubt that he has created ç
history by his exemplary life and behaviour. It is therefore but proper  ç
that  he  is  remembered  and honoured every year on his birthday, ç
known as `Hanumaj-jayant<200>'.
According  to  Hindu  mythological accounts, he was born as the son ç
of Kesar<200> and A<210>jan<193>dev<200> by the grace of <185>iva ç
and V<193>yu (the wind-god).
As regards the date, there are threedifferent traditions assigning ç
three different days for this event. They are: Caitra P<220>r<207>im<193> ç
(full-moon day during the lunar month of Caitra, generally in March/April); ç
K<193>rttika k<216><218><207>a caturda·<200> (the fourteenth day of ç
the dark fortnight in the lunar month of K<193>rttika, generally in ç
October/November); M<193>rga·ira ·ukla trayoda·<200> (thirteenth day ç
of the bright fortnight of the lunar month of M<193>rga·ira, generally ç
in November/December).
The first and second dates are more popular in North India. The last ç
is observed more in the South.
The observance of the vrata (religious vow) consists of fasting during ç
the day and worship of <185>r<200> R<193>ma followed by the worship ç
of Hanum<193>n, in the evening or night. Bathing the image of Hunum<193>n ç
with pa<210>c<193>m<216>ta (a mixture of five sweet things viz., cow's ç
milk, curds, ghee, honey and sugar) is an important item of worship.
Applying scented oil to the image as also vermillion powder are essential.
The food offering should include certain grams with jaggery.
Exhibition of wrestling talents by expert wrestlers before the image ç
is an interesting aspect of the celebrations.
In some places, a garland of betal leaves or fried eatables is put ç
on the image to ward off evils to oneself.
Ceremonial chanting of the Sundara-k<193><207><195>a (the fifth ç
book of V<193>lm<200>ki's R<193>m<193>ya<207>a) is also a part of ç
the rituals performed on this day.

@SPACE = 
@SPACE1 = 
It is an undeniable fact of history that the destiny of the world ç
has very often been shaped by great persons of sterling  character,  rather  than  the ç
mediocre mortals who were a hapless partofhistory. Man's innate ç
spirit†the personification  of  life,  energy  and consciousness†has ç
always been goading him to rise above nature by struggling against ç
it and not by being in conformity with it. It is this struggle that ç
results in his progress.
@SPACE1 = 
This  progress  can  be  in  two directions: external and internal. ç
External progress leads to a better standard of living, i.e., civilization. ç
Internal progress on the other hand, results in greater refinement ç
of the whole personality, i.e., culture.
@SPACE1 = 
Civilization  and  culture  do  not necessarily go together. Nor are ç
they mutually exclusive. They can be elegantly harmonized, provided ç
one knows the relative proportions in combining them. This is exactly ç
what the ancient <216><218>is or sages of India†whether the r<193>jar<218>is ç
like Janaka and <185>r<200> R<193>ma or the brahmar<218>is like Vasi<218><219>ha  and  Vy<193>sa†did  when  they ç
administered or guided the great kingdoms of their times.
@SPACE1 = 
World-history, whether of the ancient times or of the recent past, ç
is replete with conflicts and wars. In general, one can adduce the ç
following reasons for such conflicts:
@NO = a)
@NOK = Imperialism or dictatorship versus democracy.
@SPACE = 
@NO = b)
@NOK = The rich versus the poor.
@NO = c)
@NOK = Patriotism and nationalism versus humanism or internationalism.
@NO = d)
@NOK = Science versus religion.
@SPACE1 = 
However, the philosophy that the whole world is one family (vasudhaiva ç
ku<219>umbakam) as taught and practised byour great sages who were ç
the real socio-religious and cultural leaders, has practically eliminated ç
such conflicts in our country.
Records of ancient and medieval history of our country as given by ç
the foreign travellers and other foreigners* bespeak not only of a ç
high degree of civilization but also of culture as revealed in their ç
accounts of appreciation of ourpeople's deep devotion to truth and ç
ingrained honesty. This had been possible solely  because  the  ancient  and  the ç
medieval Hindus of India never forgot thatdharma (ethical values) ç
and adhy<193>tmavidy<193>  (spirituality)  were  the centre of gravity ç
of their life. This fact has been further buttressed by the modern ç
saints like R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, Vivek<193>nanda, Aurobindo ç
and Rama<207>a Mahar<218>i. Their life and teachings have shown us ç
the moderns, not only the need for and utility of a higher degree ç
of civilization but alsoits limitations and dangers, thereby showing ç
where to draw the border line. While they have taught us to be rightfully ç
proud of our past history and culture, they have also reminded us ç
very forcefully that we should take only the best from other nations ç
and integrate it with our basic culture.
@SPACE = 
Their advice of caution has come not a day too soon. During the last ç
few decades there has been a sickening tendency amongst  us†especially  the  younger ç
generation†to blindly imitate the Western culture, be it in hair-style ç
or dress or language or manners. All the dreadful vices of theirs ç
like consumerism, alcoholism, addiction to drugs and profligate promiscuity ç
are†fast catching us. If we do not wake up immediately to these dangers ç
and try vigorously to tread thepath blazed by our religio-spiritual ç
heritage, the future generations†if at allthey come into existence†can ç
never forgive us!
In the light of all that has been said till now, a basic study of ç
Hindu culture†as it was in the past and as it is at present†in order ç
to evolve a balanced combination of the true spirits of both the Western ç
and our cultures, has become an urgent necessity.
It is rather an uphill task to present such a comprehensive and complicated ç
subject in a capsule form, in an essay such as this. Yet, an earnest ç
attempt is being made in the following pages which, it is hoped, will ç
not be in vain.

@SB = 2.	Sa<221>sk<216>ti or Culture
@S10 = Definitions
@SPACE = 
Before undertaking a study of Hinduculture, one should understand ç
what exactly we mean by the word `culture.' Since it is being widely ç
used as the equivalent of the Sanskrit word `sa<221>sk<216>ti,' it ç
is better to study this word first, its connotations and implications. ç
The verbal root `k<216>' (to do) can give rise to several nouns when ç
associated with certain prefixes. Out of these, three words have a ç
direct bearing on our subject: prak<216>ti (basic matter or condition), ç
sa<221>sk<216>ti (refined matter or condition) and vik<216>ti (modified ç
or decayed matter or condition).
These can be explained further with suitable examples:
A block of stone is `prak<216>ti,' the basic raw material. When it ç
is sculptured into a beautiful image, it becomes `sa<221>sk<216>ti.'
A lump of gold is `prak<216>ti.' An elegant ornament made out of it ç
is `sa<221>sk<216>ti.'
Raw food articles like rice and sugar are `prak<216>ti,' whereas a ç
delicious pudding prepared out of them is `sa<221>sk<216>ti.'
On the other hand, if the block of stone is broken into chips or the ç
gold lump reduced to powder or the food articles get putrefied, they ç
become `vik<216>ti.'
The English word `culture' is derived from the Latin term cult or ç
cultus, meaning, `tilling, care, refinement and worship'. In sum, ç
it means cultivating and refining a thing to such an extent that its ç
end-product evokes our admiration and respect. This is practically ç
the same as `sa<221>sk<216>ti' of the Sanskrit language.
The word `cultivation,' also derived from the same Latin root, as ç
generally applied to the cultivation of crops from the earth, involves ç
several processes such as tilling and preparing the ground, sowing ç
the seeds, watering and manuring as alsoremoving the weeds and destroying ç
harmful insects. This will ultimately result in reaping a good crop.
This word also fits in very well with the concept of sa<221>sk<216>ti.
Another expression current in the Sanskrit language is `sa<221>sk<193>ra.' ç
It refers to the process of cultivating, preparing or refining. The ç
abstract quality in the end product is called `sa<221>sk<216>ti.' ç
But very often, the two words are used as if they are identical.
@S10 = Culture and Human Beings
The culture of a society depends on the culture of the individuals ç
comprising it, as also the relationship they have among themselves. ç
Hence great attention has to be paid to the growing and nurturing ç
of the basic values of culture in an individual.
Contrary to the vociferous assertions of the materialists or the dry ç
philosophers, a human being is the conglomeration of several parts, ç
apparently different from one another, but acting cohesively for a ç
common purpose, that of the j<200>v<193>tman or the individual soul ç
(a conscious entity) inhabiting them. They are: the physical body  including  the  sense-organs,  the ç
faculty of speech, the mind and the spirit. A proper training in culture ç
has to tackle each one of these singly, but in a way that it does ç
not interfere or overshadow the natural faculties of the others. For ç
instance, the arms should not be developed to such an extent that ç
they become a burden for the feet to carry them or allow the nose ç
to develop at the cost of the eyes and the ears! It is a balanced ç
development anda harmonious combination of all the limbs and faculties ç
that conduces not only to the health of the body but also to the well-being ç
of the personality as a whole.
Such a training as envisaged by a holistic attitude towards the development ç
of the human personality can be on the following lines:
@NO = a)
@NOK = Meticulously observing the rules ofhealth and sanitation. ç
Physical culture including yog<193>sanas.
@NO = b)
@NOK = Cultivating the faculty of speech through the study of languages ç
and grammar of those languages.
@NO = 
@NOK = Practising the art of speaking the truth at the right time ç
and place, including the knack of presenting even unpleasant truths ç
in a manner that is gracefully accepted.
@NO = c)
@NOK = Training the mind in developing discretion and discrimination ç
so that the right decision can be taken at the right time within the ç
limitations imposed by the circumstances.
@NO = 
@NOK = Exercising the intellect by the study of science, philosophy ç
and logic.
@NO = 
@NOK = Fostering a sense of justice.
@NO = d)
@NOK = Trying to develop a taste or interest in some of the arts such ç
as classical music and dance, good and elevating literature, drawing ç
and painting, drama and other theatrical arts that can rouse our finer ç
sentiments and so on.
@NO = e)
@NOK = Faith in God and a regular habit of prayer.
@SPACE1 = 
Coming to the social aspect of the training for culture, one should ç
start with greater and more intimate association with one's own family ç
members. Though this suggestion may appear a little strange† since ç
such an association seems to be taken for granted†it has become very ç
necessary to bring about a sense of togetherness and cohesion within ç
a family. Such a cohesion is almost absent now-a-days in most of the ç
families, thanks to the industrialization of the country and amechanical ç
way of life that it has engendered.
The royal secret of good human relationship with others is unselfish ç
love and genuine consideration for the needs and feelings of others. ç
This includes a sense of responsibility and duty towards others.
It goes without saying that this `charity that begins at home' should ç
gradually be extended to the neighbours, friends and relatives as ç
also other people, leading ultimately to the highest ideal of `vasudhaiva ç
ku<219>umbakam' (`the whole world is my family').
And, it can be assured that a cultured and refined individual will ç
easily succeed in his efforts at being in peace and harmony with the ç
society, for the very reason that he is a cultured and refined individual<|>!
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Basis of Culture
@SPACE = 
In the Upani<218>ads†the canonical texts of Ved<193>nta†we sometimes ç
come across the basic question, `What is that by knowing which, everything ç
else is known?' In a similar vein, we can ask, `What is that by possessing ç
which, culture can be possessed automatically?' The answer as given ç
by our <216><218>is, our wise ancestors, is `spiritual wisdom.' (And ç
it should be remembered that this spiritual wisdom, in the ultimate ç
analysis, evolves out ofspiritual experience and not out of book-learning!)
@SPACE1 = 
This question may be asked from another angle too. `In what way does ç
advancement of culture (or sa<221>sk<216>ti) leadto spiritual evolution ç
culminating in mature spiritual wisdom?'
@SPACE1 = 
A corollary that arises from this question is: `What is the basic ç
norm referring to which the evolution of cultural values is estimated?'
@SPACE1 = 
The answer is `mok<218>a' or emancipation through `<193>tmaj<210><193>na' ç
or Self-realization. This itself is adhy<193>tmavidy<193> or the science ç
of the Self within.
This is the norm for evaluation, nay, the final goal of life itself.
And, this point of view of our ancient leaders, the <216><218>is of ç
yore, has stood the test of time for several millennia!
@S10 = Training in Culture
They have advised us to follow the path of satya (truth that brings ç
about the welfare of all) and dharma (righteousness) which are eternal ç
values. For this, they have given us two parallel paths: prav<216>tti ç
(activism) and niv<216>tti (restraint). The ultimate goal of life ç
can be reached by starting with the first and passing through the ç
second, they being two phases and faces of life here. It is also possible ç
to have a balanced combination of these two and reach the same (final) ç
goal.
If the elite could learn about these truths by getting training in ç
the gurukulas (forest academies) the masses were educated by the wise ç
elders of the society through such popular devices as harikath<193>s ç
(musical discourses with ethico- religious themes), devotional music, ç
folklore, folksongs and folk-dramas, recitation of mythological works ç
and so on.1
That an ideal civilization-cum-culture can throw up an ideal person ç
has been proved by the sage V<193>lm<200>ki in his celebrated work, ç
the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a. Apart from <185>r<200> R<193>ma,2 the ç
principal hero, we come across a galaxy of great persons such as Lak<218>ma<207>a, ç
Bharata, Hanum<193>n, Vibh<200><218>a<207>a, S<200>t<193>, Sumitr<193> ç
and Ma<207><195>odar<200>, as also the sages like Vasi<218><219>ha, ç
Agastya and Atri.
Though adhy<193>tmavidy<193>†or, to put it in the modern language, ç
religion and philosophy†has been the primary basis of Hindu culture, ç
all other aspects of life here and now, that contribute to the attainment ç
of peace and joy, have also been given their due place. For instance: ç
social values; political institutions including the judiciary; economic ç
ideas; educational system; physical, chemical, biological and health ç
sciences; engineering sciences, arts like music, dance, drama, drawing, ç
painting and sculpture, and s<%22>o<%0>on.
It will be not only interesting and fascinating, but also rewarding, ç
to undertake a panoramic study of all these facets of Hindu culture. ç
Such an attempt on the one hand can boost our self-confidence and ç
public image; and on the other, further inspire us to do even better, ç
surpassing the other nations in the process, as we had done in an ç
earlier age.
@SB = <R>ç
3.	Religion and Philosophy
@S10 = Religion is Adhy<193>tmavidy<193>
Religion, in its truest sense of adhy<193>tmavidy<193>, has been the ç
basis ofHindu culture. Vivek<193>nanda has an interesting description ç
of the Hindu:*
`He does everything in a religious manner. He eats religiously; he ç
sleeps religiously,  he  rises  in  the  morning religiously, he does ç
good things religiously; and he also does bad things religiously!'
According to him, religion is not just belief in certain dogmas or ç
observing some rituals but realizing the divinity that is already ç
there in everyone of us. Whatever helps us to manifest this latent ç
divinity is also religion. As already pointed out, it is this that ç
has been termed `adhy<193>tma-vidy<193>' or the science of the Self ç
within.
@S10 = Its Two Aspects†<R>ç
The Dar·anas and the Yogas
This adhy<193>tmavidy<193> has two aspects: theory and practice. Theoretical ç
speculations have led to the evolution of several schools of philosophy. ç
The practical application of their findings has led to the formation ç
of several systems of s<193>dhan<193>s or spiritual exercises, generally ç
called `yogas'.
The well-known schools of Hindu philosophy are six. Hence the name ç
`<218>a<195>-dar·anas' (<218>a<195> = six; dar·ana = philo- sophy). ç
They are: Ny<193>ya of Gautama, Vai·e<218>ika of Ka<207><193>da, S<193><209>khya ç
of Kapila, Yoga of Pata<210>jali, M<200>m<193><221>s<193> of Jaimini ç
and Ved<193>nta of B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a.
The Ny<193>ya system of Gautama and the Vai·e<218>ika system of Ka<207><193>da ç
envisage creation by Param<193>tman (God) out of a<207>us (atoms) ç
which are eternal. The shape of things is directly related to the ç
ad<216><218><219>a (unseen deserts) of the j<200>vas (individual souls) ç
left over unredeemed, from the previous cycle of creation. Combination ç
of these atoms causes creation and their disintegration results in ç
the dissolution ofthis universe. The j<200>va has got into thebondage ç
of transmigration due to ignorance of its real nature as an eternal ç
entity different from the body, the senses and the mind. He attains ç
mok<218>a or liberation (a state of absolute negation of all pain ç
and suffering) through tattvaj<210><193>na (knowledge of the realities) ç
by listening (·rava<207>a) to the truths mentioned in the scriptures, ç
by reflecting on the same (manana) and by meditation on his true nature ç
(nididhy<193>sana).
The S<193><209>khya system of Kapila and the Yoga system of Pata<210>jali ç
are complementary to each other. They advance thetheory that prak<216>ti ç
(the fundamental matrix of matter) evolves into this universe in the ç
presence of the puru<218>as (the individual souls) who act as catalytic ç
agents. In fact, the whole process of creation is for the benefit ç
of the puru<218>as, for their spiritual upliftment, resulting finally ç
in their emancipation. The pa<210>cabh<220>tas (the five elements ç
like earth, water and fire) are evolutes of this prak<216>ti. The  universe  is  a  permutation  and ç
combination of these. Though essentially detached from prak<216>ti, ç
the puru<218>a involves himself in bondage by getting attached to ç
it and its products. This leads to repeated transmigration. Detachment ç
from it through vivekakhy<193>ti (discriminaion and wisdom) aided ç
by the eight steps of Yoga leads him finally to emancipation.
The M<200>m<193><221>s<193> system of Jaimini advocates the theory ç
that prak<216>ti or insentient nature evolves by itself into this ç
universe, impelled by the pr<193>rabdha karma (actions done by the ç
individual souls in the previous lives and about to be fructified) ç
of the j<200>vas. Their liberation (described as total cessation of ç
pain and suffering) is achieved by strictly following all the directions ç
given in the M<200>m<193><221>s<193> works with regard to karmas (Vedic ç
rituals and other actions).
According to the Ved<193>nta system ofB<193>dar<193>ya<207>a (also ç
known as Vy<193>sa), Brahman  the  Absolute,  projects  this universe ç
out of Itself, sustains it and withdraws it into Itself in each cycle ç
of creation. It is something akin to a web coming out of a spider's ç
mouth or sparks emitted out of fire. Hence, everything that exists ç
is really Brahman and there is nothing that is not Brahman. The j<200>va ç
gets liberated through j<210><193>na (knowledge of his real naure) ç
and bhakti (devotion to Brahman) regaining his original state of infinite ç
bliss.
Coming to Yoga, the practical aspect, there  are  four  of  them:  Karmayoga, ç
Bhaktiyoga, J<210><193>nayoga and R<193>jayoga. All these yogas cleanse ç
the mind and makeitso pure that the <193>tman within (Self or God) ç
is automatically revealed. If Karmayoga advocates the performance ç
of all ordained actions with a desireless andselfless attitude, Bhaktiyoga ç
teaches devotion to God and attaining him through his grace. J<210><193>nayoga ç
advises constant reflection and meditation on the true nature of oneself ç
as the <193>tman, ultimately resulting in its experience. R<193>jayoga ç
(based mainly on Pata<210>jali's Yoga system) prescribes an eightfold ç
path leading finally to sam<193>dhi or superconscious experience of ç
the Self within.
It should be specially stressed here that all these philosophical ç
speculations and practical spiritual disciplines are based almost ç
entirely on the basic scriptures of Hinduism, viz., the Vedas, the ç
Upani<218>ads, the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> and allied works.
@S10 = S<193>m<193>nya Dharmas or Basic Moral Values
These works, while dealing with philosophical principles or modes ç
of spiritual practice, have also vigorously stressed the need for ç
inculcating s<193>m<193>nya-dharmas or certain basic moral and ethical ç
values in one's life, to refine oneself and to create social harmony. ç
Both of these conduce to quick spiritual progress. They are: ahi<221>s<193> ç
(nonviolence), satya (truth), asteya (nonstealing), d<193>na (giving ç
gifts to deserving persons), k<218><193>nti (forbearance), dama (control ç
of passions), ·ama (inner peace), ak<193>rpa<207>ya (not demeaning ç
oneself), ·auca (purity) and tapas (austerity).
@S10 = The Four Puru<218><193>rthas
While stressing mok<218>a as the ultimate goal of human life, the ç
scriptures advocating adhy<193>tmavidy<193> have not forgotten the ç
legitimate desires and aspirations of the average human beings. They ç
are: artha (wealth) and k<193>ma (instinctive desires of the flesh). ç
However, these can be earned and enjoyed only when they are in conformity ç
with dharma (righteousness) and do not transgress it. What dharma ç
is and what it is not, can be known only through the holy books and ç
the holy persons. Of course, mok<218>a as the final goal of life is ç
never omitted from such lists. These four together†dharma, artha, ç
k<193>ma and mok<218>a†are called puru<218><193>rthas (the four ends ç
of life desired by all human beings).
@S10 = The Guru
One of the most important things repeatedly stressed in our religio-philosophical ç
works is that no progress is ever possible in any field of life†much ç
less in the field of adhy<193>tmavidy<193>†without the active help ç
and guidance of the guru or teacher. A thorough knowledge of the religious ç
works, practical experience, a sinless life and a loving concern for ç
the welfare of the disciple are the qualifications expected of a guru. ç
Humility, eagerness and earnestness to learn and devoted service to ç
the guru are the desired qualities in a ·i<218>ya or a disciple. When ç
the disciple advances to great heights in religio-spiritual life, ç
he is required to pass on that knowledge to worthy disciples thus ç
keeping alive a great tradition for the benefit of humankind.
From all this we can easily understand  that  the  basic  scriptures  of ç
Hinduism†of all hues and views†never ignored the social aspects of ç
life even while constantly stressing the ultimate spiritual goal.
And, this is a very significant contri- bution to the development ç
of our culture.
@SB = <R>ç
4.	Hindu Society
@S10 = Introduction
It is the culture of a country that converts a denizen into a citizen ç
and a citizen into a national. Again, it is the individual human being ç
that is called a denizen or a citizen or a national. A society comprises ç
of families and, families, of individuals. Hence, a study of the culture ç
of the Hindu society has to embrace all aspects of the individual ç
and the social life.
The puru<218><193>rtha principle, the var<207>a system and the <193>·rama ç
scheme of life are the three legs of the tripod that gave stability ç
and vigour to the Hindu society †whenever they were understood properly ç
and  implemented  rightly†during  the ancient and medieval periods. ç
If the puru<218><193>rtha principle (as explained on p.33) has fulfilled ç
the aspirations of an individual and given him a goal and a direction ç
to his life, the <193>·rama scheme of life has given it a concrete ç
and practical shape. And, the var<207>a system has given him an organizational ç
structure to work out the same. Therefore it is necessary to describe ç
briefly these two facets of Hindu social life: the var<207>a system ç
and the <193>·rama scheme.
@S10 = The Var<207>a System
The fourfold var<207>a system goes back to the <184>gvedasa<221>hit<193> ç
(vide 8.35.16.7; 1.10.8.7) itself. To make a living by choosing a ç
profession as per one's desire and aptitude is a common phenomenon ç
seen in all civilized societies. It is the duty of the society to ç
provide suitable opportunities for its members to choose and pursue ç
those vocations that agree with their nature. This is the philosophy ç
behind the var<207>a system. The Vedas, including the Puru<218>as<220>kta ç
(wherein this fourfold division of the society has been enunciated ç
very clearly) have only recognized its existence and not created ç
it.
As a society grows in size and civilization, there has got to be a ç
division of labour, since all persons cannot do all things. In the ç
early Vedic period, this division of labour might have taken place ç
on a voluntary basis, even as the members of a family do so on any ç
important occasion affecting the whole family. Some chose the occupation ç
of acquiring knowledge, wisdom and culture, and training the younger ç
generation in them. They became the br<193>hma<207>as. Those who were ç
physically sturdy and strong, took to arms to protect the society ç
from external aggression as also maintain internal law and order. ç
Theywere the k<218>attriyas. A great majority of the rest devoted ç
themselves to the production and distribution of wealth and goods ç
through agriculture, dairy farming, trade and commerce. They were ç
called the vai·yas. The others who could not fit into any of these ç
vocations made a living by supplying manual labour and serving others. ç
They became the ·<220>dras. In course of time, each of these var<207>as†from ç
the br<193>hma<207>as to the ·<220>dras†acquired hierarchical superiority ç
over the succeeding ones.
Though this was a natural process based on gu<207>a (aptitude) and ç
karma (vocation chosen as per that aptitude), it was more a general ç
rule and an ideal one at that. Hence, birth in a var<207>a became ç
an easier and a more practicable principle to fix up the var<207>a ç
of that individual. This was the beginning of the j<193>ti or the ç
caste system wherein the var<207>a got automatically fixed by birth ç
(j<193>ti = birth).
India is a continent of different races. But the people of these races ç
have been welded together into an integrated, though federal, society ç
by the var<207>a-j<193>ti system. Even the foreign invaders like the ç
<185>akas and H<220><207>as never tried to destroy it but gracefully ç
accepted it. The system has protected the Hindu society by preserving ç
the various professions, by preventing unhealthy competitions and ç
by democratizing institutions. It has thus preserved the unity of ç
the country in spite of the diversities.
As for the caste-conflicts, they are mostly of the post-British era. ç
The problem has sometimes been compounded by selfish and narrow-minded ç
political and social leaders, ever eager to fish in troubled waters.
Some interesting sidelights of the var<207>a-caste-system may now ç
be stated here which give us an idea of the society of the ancient ç
and medieval days:
Performing Vedic sacrifices was an integral part of a br<193>hma<207>a's ç
professional life. He could not refuse to eat, when invited, at the ç
houses of sac-ch<220>dras (good ·<220>dras who followed the s<193>m<193>nya ç
dharmas or the basic moral code in their life) especially if they ç
were his employees orfamily friends. During national emergencies ç
or calamities he could take to the vocations of other castes. He was ç
relegated to the group of ca<207><195><193>las (lowest among the ·<220>dras) ç
if he gave up the br<193>hminical way of life without valid reasons.
Evidence is not wanting to show that many br<193>hma<207>as went to ç
foreign countries such as Egypt, Greece, Rome, Mexico as also the ç
South-East Asian countries to preach religion, philosophy and various ç
aspects of Hindu culture.
As for the k<218>attriyas, many of them were not only good kings but ç
also experts in the field of Vedic lore and saintly in their personal ç
life.
Indian k<218>attriya soldiers are said to have participated in the ç
Marathon and Plataea battles (in Greece) in 490 <MS>B.C.<D>
The kings had built huge armies and navies. The armies included the ç
use of horses and elephants.
The vai·yas were generally divided into two groups: the g<216>hapatis ç
and the ·re<218><219>h<200>s. The former lived by agriculture and ç
dairy-farming. The latter were devoted to trade and commerce. They ç
had successfully built huge corporations and had alsoestablished ç
trade links with foreign countries such as China and J<193>va in the ç
east, and, Egypt, Greece and Rome in theWest.
The ·<220>dras were divided into two classes: the sacch<220>dras (the ç
good) and the asacch<220>dras (the not-so-good). The former who led ç
a good life†honouring the general moral principles†had been permitted ç
even to undergo the upanayana ceremony and perform certain kinds of ç
yaj<210>as or sacrifices. They could learn and teach religious truths ç
except the Vedas. They could adopt various professions such as fighting, ç
agriculture, mat-making, fishing, laundry, haircutting and so on.
Asp<216>·yat<193> or untouchability, though unknown during the Vedic ç
days, might have gradually started during the 8th century <MS>B.C.<D> ç
Certain vocations considered as unclean and a health hazard, committing ç
of heinous sins, people of certain countries whose ways of life radically ç
differed from those of the people here, certain cults considered as ç
heretical and hence dangerous†these seem to be the various reasons ç
for the origin and spread of the idea of untouchability over the centuries. ç
But even they were given enough scope for moral and spiritual development ç
by exhorting them to follow the s<193>m<193>nya dharmas as also the ç
worship of gods like Vi<218><207>u or Bhairava (an aspect of <185>iva).
Work   for   their   emancipation, especially by the religious teachers ç
of devotional  schools,  has  gone  on  for centuries, though the ç
results achieved are not commensurate with the efforts put in.
@S10 = The °·rama Scheme
The <193>·rama scheme of life, designed to sublimate the basic instincts ç
of a human being, may now be described briefly. According to this, ç
the life of an individual was divided into four <193>·ramas or stages ç
of life. They are: brahmacarya (student-hood), g<193>rhasthya (married ç
state), v<193>naprastha (the state of forest recluse) and sa<221>ny<193>sa ç
(monkhood).
Brahmacarya, the first stage of life, was usually of twelve years' ç
duration (from the seventh or eighth to the nineteenth or the twentieth ç
year). It was mainly devoted to study and discipline. The student ç
was required to stay in the gurukula or the house of his teacher and ç
learn the sciences†sacred as well as secular†and the arts.
These  teachers  in  ancient  India usually lived in hermitages not ç
far from the towns. The children under their care lived under the ç
same roof without any distinction of wealth and status, all leading ç
a hard, austere life. Serving the teacher and actively participating ç
in the household duties were as much part of their life as learning ç
the Vedas and mastering secular sciences. Begging the food, eschewing ç
the pleasures of life (in which brahmacarya or celibacy was the most ç
important) and abstaining from the affairs of the world were a prominent ç
part of their training.
After returning home, the student, now a young man, was expected to ç
marry and raise a family. Since marriage was considered as a sa<221>sk<193>ra ç
or a sacrament, and the wife as a life-mate in righteous living, it ç
was not considered as an obstacle to spiritual evolution. The g<216>hastha ç
or the householder was expected to earn well by righteous means and ç
live a happy and decent life which had to be socially useful. Among ç
his principal duties were the pa<210>cayaj<210>as or the five daily ç
sacrifices: devayaj<210>a (offering oblations to Indra and other deities ç
into the duly consecrated Vedic fires), <216><218>iyaj<210>a (appeasing ç
the <216><218>is or the sages by study and teaching of the Vedas), ç
pit<216>yaj<210>a (obsequial offerings to the departed manes), n<216>yaj<210>a ç
(feeding guests and hungry persons) and bh<220>ta- yaj<210>a (feeding ç
the domestic animals).
At the approach of old-age, the householder was to hand over the responsi-bilities ç
of the family to his children and retire to the forest along with ç
his wife if she was willing, or alone, if she was not. In this stage ç
known as v<193>naprastha (vana= forest; prasth<193>na = going) he ç
was to lead a contemplative life, in spiritual pursuits. It was actually ç
a life preparatory to the final stage, sa<221>ny<193>sa.
When this vanaprasthin or the forest recluse felt enough inner strength ç
to totally renounce all possessions and lead the life of an itinerant ç
monk, he could embrace sa<221>ny<193>sa or the monastic life, after ç
sending his wife to be taken care of, by the children. In this stage ç
of life, he had to move about constantly from place to place, begging ç
his food and spending his entire time in contemplation on God. He ç
was to practise self-control, freedom from desires and attachments, ç
and, universal love.
Though these four <193>·ramas were intended to be adopted successively, ç
excep- tions were allowed in special cases, so that one could take ç
sa<221>ny<193>sa even from the first or the second stage.
It appears that only the br<193>hma<207>as were considered competent ç
or eligible to adopt sa<221>ny<193>sa.
Some additional†but useful†information about the four <193>·ramas ç
may now be given here:
A brahmac<193>rin, living in the house of his guru, as a celibate, ç
could, if he so desired, continue specialization in Vedic studies ç
for 24 or even 48 years.
Eight types of marriage have been mentioned out of which only four ç
were considered as pure and legal. They are: br<193>hma (the gift ç
of a daughter by the father to a man learned in the Vedas and of good ç
conduct), daiva (the gift of daughter to the presiding priest of a ç
Vedic sacrifice), <193>r<218>a (giving away one's daughter after receiving ç
from the bridegroom [for the fulfilment of the sacred law] a cow and ç
a bull) and pr<193>j<193>patya (gifting of the daughter by the father, ç
stipulating the condition that the bridegroom remain monogamous and ç
be faithful to her).
Tying of the ma<209>galas<220>tra (or ma<209>galapratisara) (the thread ç
with an amulet, signifying auspiciousness to the bride) by the bridegroom ç
seems to be a later social custom, not mentioned in the dharma·<193>stras.
@S10 = Status of Women
Here, we can dilate a little, on the status and condition of women ç
in India. During the Vedic age they were given a high place in the ç
society. The mention of women sages like V<193>c, Ambh<216><207><200>, ç
Roma·<193> and G<193>rg<200> in the Vedic lore corroborates this view. ç
Women could undergo the upanayana sacrament and pursue Vedic studies. ç
Those who chose this path were called `brahmav<193>din<200>s.' The ç
others who did not pursue this path but chose to enter into the married ç
life straight-away, were called `sadyovadh<220>s.' Co-education seems ç
to have existed in the earlier period. K<218>attriya ladies got training ç
in the use of arms and other martial arts. Both kany<193>viv<193>ha ç
(marriage of a pre-puberty girl arranged by her parents) and prau<195>haviv<193>ha ç
(marriage after attaining puberty) were prevalent. Under certain circumstances, ç
the girl had the freedom to choose her husband.
The wife known as `g<216>hi<207><200>' was considered as `hal<%22>f<%0>' ç
of the husband and constituted the real `g<216>ha' or home. She was ç
called `s<193>mr<193>j<210><200>' (the queen or the mistress of the ç
home) and had an equal share in the performance of religious rites.
Divorce and remarriage of women were allowe<%26>d<%0>under very special ç
conditions.
Shaving of the hair and wearing red saries by the widows or their ç
committing sahagamana (dying on the funeral pyre of their dead husbands) ç
was never compulsory. The former custom seems to have been confined ç
to a small section of the br<193>hma<207>as, that too in South India. ç
The idea, perhaps, was that their life should be similar to that of ç
the sa<221>ny<193>sins.
It is interesting to note that ve·y<193>s (prostitutes) were allowed ç
to make a living, in the society, but were regulated by a code of ç
conduct specially made for them!
The devad<193>s<200>-system (devad<193>s<200> = a girl or a woman ç
`married' to the God in a temple and expected to spend her life as ç
his servant-maid) seems to be a later development.
@S10 = Some More Aspects of Social Life
Now, a few more aspects of Hindu social life, may be described:
Though <193>tmahaty<193> or suicide was severely condemned as a sinful ç
act, it was allowed as a ritual under very special conditions such ç
as old-age decrepitude, incurable diseases causing much suffering ç
to oneself and to others, as a pr<193>ya·citta or expiation for heinous ç
sins, for protecting one's religion and honour and so on. As far as ç
possible, such ritual suicides were to be committed in t<200>rthak<218>etras ç
(holy places, places of pilgrimage).
Formal conversions into Hinduism from alien religions do not seem ç
to have existed. Foreigners just adopted the Hindu way of life and ç
were absorbed into the society.
However, patitasa<221>sk<193>ra and ·uddhi (expiations and purification ç
for those fallen from the Hindu way of life) (patita = one who is ç
fallen) were very much prevalent and appropriate rites had been prescribed ç
for the same.
Many taboos existed with regard to food since it was believed that ç
food affected the mind also. Pure food was conducive to purity of ç
mind. Hence, rules and regulations were set out about food and eating†what ç
to eat and what not to eat; how to eat and how not to eat and so on.
M<193><221>sabhojana (eating of flesh) wascommon during the Vedic ç
period. However, it was later on discouraged† though tolerated†due ç
to the influence of Jainism and Buddhism.
Though sur<193>p<193>na (drinking of wine) existed, it was severely ç
condemned as a heinous sin.1
P<193>ka·<193>stra (the culinary art) was well-developed, Nala and ç
Bh<200>ma being the legendary experts in this field.
Dh<220>map<193>na (smoking of fragrant substances) and use of snuff ç
(special medicinal powders, only for curing certain diseases) have ç
been mentioned. Smoking and taking snuff, as we know them today, did ç
not exist.2
Cotton, woollen and silk cloths were in use since several centuries ç
before the Christian era. Unstitched clothes were preferred. Though ç
dhoti and c<193>dar (or chaddar or uttar<200>ya, upper wearing cloth) ç
were common, long shirts, pyjamas and coats were not unknown. Several ç
types of head-dresses, saris and bodices for women were in use.
Several attractive styles of dressing hair and wearing of ornaments ç
(by both men and women) existed, reflecting the zest for life.
Wrestling, polo, playing of cards had their origin in India and were ç
quite popular. There were many other games† simple but exciting and ç
exhilarating† inculcating and embellishing good sportsmanship.
From the foregoing portrayal of the Hindu society one thing stands ç
out as supreme: Life is not a curse but a great gift of God. It ç
must therefore be lived well. Though mok<218>a is the ultimate goal ç
of life, all aspects of life should be taken into consideration, ç
each being given its due place, but always in harmony with all the ç
other aspects.
It is this understanding and conviction of the Hindu religious and ç
social leaders that has imparted stability as well as resilience to ç
the society over the millennia.

5.	Hindu Educational System
@S10 = Introduction
The Upani<218>ads aver that whatever good is done with full knowledge ç
and awareness becomes forceful and fruitful in life. Bhart<216>hari, ç
a well-known Sanskrit poet, compares a man without any education to ç
a brute. Albert Einstein (<MS>A.D. <D>1879-1955) seems to concur with ç
him when he likens a man with a specialized knowledge, but lacking ç
in values, to a well-trained dog!
Vivek<193>nanda, the great patriot-prophet of Modern India, who could ç
feel the pulse of the Indian nation, states that:
@NO = a)
@NOK = Education is the panacea for all ourills.
@NO = b)
@NOK = It is the manifestation of the perfection already in man.
@NO = c)
@NOK = It is the training by which the current and expression of will ç
are brought under control and become fruitful in life.
@NO = d)
@NOK = It  is  life-building,  man-making, character-making assimilation ç
of ideas.
It is rather astonishing that many Western savants* have practically ç
echoed Vivek<193>nanda's ideas though in different words.
These can be briefly summarized as follows:
@NO = a)
@NOK = Education should teach our children self-control, the art of ç
holding one's passions and prejudices.
@NO = b)
@NOK = It should instil true and worthy motives, a profound religious ç
feeling and inspire the formation of a great character.
@NO = c)
@NOK = It should help us to understand the laws of God in nature and ç
to shape our lives to be in consonance with those laws.
@NO = d)
@NOK = It should pay much greater attention to the development of ç
the powers of the mind than mere learning of facts.
The ancient and medieval systems of education recognized all these ç
aspects while formulating the policies guiding them. Accordingly all ç
fields of vidy<193> or knowledge were divided into two broad streams:  the  par<193>vidy<193>  (the  higher ç
knowledge, the spiritual wisdom) and the apar<193>vidy<193> (the lower ç
knowledge, the secular sciences). The latter is needed to live a comfortable ç
life here. The former helps one to be fully prepared for the hereafter. ç
Hence a balanced combination of both, is advocated so that both civilization ç
and culture are imparted.
It is very interesting to note that even an ancient Upani<218>ad†the ç
Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad†assigned to the period 4000 <MS>B.C.<D> ç
to 2500 <MS>B.C.<D>, mentions as many as fifteen branches of knowledge ç
apart from the four Vedas! Some of them are: Vy<193>kara<207>a (grammar), ç
Pitrya (science of obsequial rites), Ga<207>ita (mathematics), Daiva ç
(knowledge of the portents), Tarka (logic),  Ek<193>yana  (ethics),  Bh<220>tavidy<193> ç
(science  of  the  spirits),  Dhanurveda (martial  arts  and  sciences),  Jyauti<218>a ç
(astronomy) and Devajanavidy<193> (the art of preparing perfumes, ç
music, dancing and sculpture).
@S10 = Constituents of an Educational System
The three constituents of an educational system are: the teacher, ç
the student and the content as also the methods of education.
A spiritual teacher†generally called `guru' or `<193>c<193>rya'<|>1†was ç
expected to be a `·rotriya' (learned in the Vedas and allied scriptures) ç
and a `brahmani<218><219>ha' (well- established in Brahman or God). ç
As applied to other fields of knowledge it could mean that he should ç
be an expert both in theory and in practice. An impeccable character, ç
earnestness to teach and a genuine love towards the student were the ç
additional qualities expected in him.
Eagerness to learn, humility, obedience to the teacher, self-control, ç
absence of laziness in the pursuit of knowledge and willingness to ç
do personal service to the teacher†these were the essential traits ç
a student must possess, to qualify for admission.
@S10 = Gurukulas
The teachers kept their students in their own houses. When the number ç
of students became large, these houses would grow into institutions ç
called `gurukulas,' established by the society, the kings and the ç
rich endowing them with sufficient property and funds so that they ç
could provide quality education, free of cost, to all the students.
As a result, these gurukulas or educational academies grew to enormous ç
dimensions†both in quality and quantity †thus fulfilling the significance ç
of their very names: guru<|>=<|>enormous, kula<|>=<|>institution. It was ç
not uncommon to find as many as ten thousand students in some of these ç
bigger institutions. Not only out of necessity, but also as a good ç
practice,the senior and better qualified students were made to teach ç
the novices and also supervise over their life and discipline. Though ç
punishments for transgressions existed  they  were  not  very  severe. ç
Incorrigible students were expelled to savethe discipline and reputation ç
of the institution.
For imparting par<193>vidy<193> or spiritual wisdom, an earnest desire ç
to learn and a willingness to undergo tapas or austerity were the ç
only requirements. Neither var<207>a nor <193>·rama nor age seems ç
to have mattered.
However, for the study of the Vedas and allied sciences like the Ved<193><209>gas,2 ç
some restrictions had been imposed. Itwas open only to the dvijas ç
(the `twice-born,' the members of the first three castes) and that ç
too after the boys had undergone the upanayana1 ceremony.
Now, some additional, but miscellaneous, information can be given ç
to get a more complete picture of the system over the centuries:
Scholarly disputations and philosophical discussions used to take ç
place even in the Vedic period, in meetings generally known as `samiti' ç
or `sam<193>ja' or `pari<218>ad'.
V<193>r<193><207>as<200> or K<193>·<200> and Tak<218>a·il<193> were ç
well-known as great centres of learning even from the 8th century ç
<MS>B.C.<D> Some cities like P<193><219>al<200>putra, Vidi·<193> and ç
K<193><210>c<200>puram were  called  `gha<219>ik<193>sth<193>nas,'  centres ç
capable of measuring the scholarship of the savants. In such centres ç
there was provision to get training in 14 to 18 branches of learning.2 ç
Students were free to acquire a deep knowledge of their religion without ç
any hindrance from the followers of other religions.
The universities of Tak<218>a·il<193> (400 <MS>B.C.<D>), Vikrama·il<193> ç
(<MS>A.D.<D> 800) and N<193>land<193> (<MS>A.D.<D> 600) had attained ç
phenomenal growth and fame. These universities had several mah<193>p<193><219>ha·<193>l<193>s ç
(colleges) and each of these again comprised several lecture halls. ç
There were three huge buildings housing  big  libraries  of  invaluable ç
manuscripts.
Admission tests were very strict and only 20% of the aspirants could ç
succeed in getting admission!
In the N<193>land<193> University alone there were 8500 students, ç
taught by 1500 teachers  with  at  least  100  lectures delivered ç
per day! Professors like N<193>g<193>rjuna, Vasubandhu and Di<209>n<193>ga ç
were  internationally  reputed  scholars attracting a large number ç
of students from many foreign countries like China, Japan, Korea, ç
Turkestan, Burma, G<193>ndh<193>ra (Afghanisthan), Sum<193>tra and ç
Persia. Though education was mostly residential and free, students ç
who could afford to pay, did so.
Among  the  residential  students Buddhist nuns were also there. However, ç
according to Hiuen Tsang (<MS>A.D.<D> 600-664) and I-Tsing (<MS>A.D.<D> ç
635-713), not even a single instance of misconduct had been noticed ç
or discovered, thanks to the high degree of moral discipline kept ç
up by the teachers and the administrators.
Apart from these Buddhist univer- sities, we learn from Kau<219>ilya ç
(300 <MS>B.C.<D>) and others that there were industrial andvocational ç
training institutions too, imparting specialized training in those ç
branches.
From all these accounts we find that the education system of the ancient ç
andmedieval India was not only highly developed but also capable ç
of delivering to us a lesson or two even now.
@S10 = Script, Language and Literature
A passing reference may now be made to some allied topics like the ç
evolution of the script, language and literature. The art of writing ç
was known even during theVedic age though memorization was preferred ç
and encouraged. The two scripts †Br<193>hm<200> and Kharo<218><219>h<200> ç
are known to have existed even in600<MS>B.C.<D> Both the Devan<193>gar<200> ç
and some of the South Indian scripts are its evolutes. T<193>lapatra ç
(palm-leaf), Bh<220>rjapatra (birch-bark), wooden plates, cloth (of ç
cotton or silk), leather, stone and bricks were used for writing.
Evidence is not lacking to conclude that Sanskrit works existed even ç
as earlyas 600 to 100 <MS>B.C.<D> Apart from the Vedas, the epics†the ç
R<193>m<193>ya<207>a and the Mah<193>bh<193>rata†stand out as ç
monuments of exquisitely beautiful literature of a very high standard. ç
The ease and facility with which the Sanskrit language has been used ç
even in the composition of technical subjects bearing on liturgy, ç
medical and health sciences, ethics or linguistics, is astounding.
The  Pr<193>k<216>t  language†a  popular derivative of Sanskrit†also ç
had been fairly well-developed even by 500 <MS>B.C.<D>
The following table gives the approximate periods of the evolution ç
of the earliest literary works in other Indian languages:
@SPACE1 = 
@L3 = Assamese	:	<MS>A.D.<D> 1300<R>ç

A few important literary works in these languages composed during ç
the early and the medieval periods may now be cited:
Works of Hemasarasvat<200>, Harihara Vipra and <185>a<209>kara Deva ç
in Assamese; the Ma<209>gala and the Vijaya literature in Bengali; ç
works of Naras<200> Meht<193> and R<193>m<193>nanda in Gujarati; compositions ç
of Tulas<200>das, M<200>r<193>, Vidy<193>pati and Kab<200>r in Hindi; ç
grammar and mythological literature of Ke·ir<193>ja, Pampa, Ranna ç
and Harihara as also the religious literature of the <185>iva·ara<207>as ç
and Harid<193>sas of Kannada; works of J<210><193>ne·var, Ekn<193>th, ç

of Tamil saints in Tamil; the poetical works of <185>r<200>n<193>tha, ç
Potana, Vemana and A<207><207>am<193>c<193>rya in Telugu.
From all these, we can conclude thatthe Indian languages and literature ç
had attained considerable growth and refinement even by the middle ç
ages.

6.	Hindu Political Institutions
@S10 = Introduction
Politics in the modern period seems to have become the science of ç
exigencies, mainly because politicians have perfected the art of circumventing ç
God himself<|>!
But, look at how Atri, one of the seven great sages of the saptar<218>i-group, ç
defines the duties of the ruler of a country:
<%16>`<%0>The five duties of a king are: punishing the wicked, honouring ç
the good,filling up the treasury by right means, meting out justice ç
impartially and protecting the kingdom by all means at his disposal.' ç
(Atrisa<221>hit<193> 1.28).
The Hindu tradition divides the ·<193>stras†authoritative texts of ç
religion and culture†into four broad groups: tray<200> (the Vedas), ç
<193>nv<200>k<218>ik<200> (logic), v<193>rt<193> (economics and politics) ç
and da<207><195>an<200>ti (statecraft). However, the Artha·<193>stra ç
of Kau<219>ilya (assigned tothe period 300 <MS>B.C.<D>) deals with ç
the last two topics together and is easily the best work on this subject. ç
Henceany study of the Hindu political system or its institutions ç
will be on a safe track if it follows this ideal text.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Generalities
@SPACE1 = 
Before dealing with the r<193>jy<193><209>gas or the constituents ç
of the State as detailed by Kau<219>ilya, a few generalities may now ç
be described. The ancient and medieval writers on statecraft and political ç
science had recognized the absolute need for theauthority of the ç
State without which`matsya-ny<193>ya' (the jungle-law) would prevail. ç
They had also solved the problem of individual freedom versus social ç
order and discipline, by applying, the fundamental principles of the ç
dharma-·<193>stras.* While it was conceded that a system was meant ç
to bring about the general good of the individuals comprising it, ç
no individual or coterie was allowed to usurp the power, boss over ç
or harass the others.
Democracy was not at all an unknown system in ancient and medieval ç
India. The various public institutions such as the gr<193>mapa<210>c<193>yats, ç
sabh<193>s and samitis, pari<218>ads and mah<193>n<193><195>us practised ç
it fairlyextensively. Detailed instructions regarding elections to ç
such institutions are to be found in some works and stone edicts.
In the Vedic age, the kings were actually social leaders elected by ç
the people. The office of the king as a hereditary institution seems ç
to be a later development. Even then, peoples' consent was taken before ç
the appointment of the Yuvar<193>ja (the crown prince, successor to ç
the throne).
The kingdom was not the personal property of the king. However, ç
he could own lands, buildings and other property from his earnings.
Republics too were known to have existed even as early as the time ç
of the Aitareya Br<193>hma<207>a (3000 <MS>B.C.<D>). The rulers ç
were expected to be devoted to truth and righteousness. They were ç
always obliged to obey the dictates of the cabinet, called `mantripari<218>ad'. ç
Instances are not wanting where the evil rulers were dethroned or ç
even killed!
@SPACE = 
@S10 = The<|><|>R<193>jy<193><209>ga<%8>s<%0><|>or the<|><|>Constituents ç
of a State
@SPACE1 = 
A brief study of the r<193>jy<193><209>gas or the constituents of ç
a State may now be taken up. They are: sv<193>min (king), mantripari<218>ad ç
(council of ministers), janapada (people), durga and bala (fort and ç
armed forces), ko·a (treasury), and mitra (allies).
@S8ITAL = SV°MIN <%12>(<%0>The Kin<%12>g<%0>)
The ancient and medieval works onpolitical science recognized the ç
great necessity for the office of the king or the supreme Head of ç
the State. Since everything concerning the State ultimately depended ç
upon him, he was expected to possess some basic qualities and proficiency ç
in some specified fields. They were: physical strength and stamina, ç
expertise in the use of astras (missiles) and ·astras (weapons) and ç
a good knowledge of the four branches of learning. To understand the ç
basic principles of dharma and act according to them he must have ç
been properly educated, refined and cultured. Needless to say that ç
self-control was an essential part of this training.
@SPACE1 = 
@EMERGEN1 = Since the stability of the society depended on the strict ç
maintenance of dharma by all concerned, and since the var<207>a-<193>·rama-system ç
was considered pivo-tal to it, the king was expected to enforce it ç
strictly. In the process he was obliged to deal with the transgressors ç
very sternly.
@SPACE1 = 
@EMERGEN1 = Contrary to the Western concept that the king was the ç
owner of all the land over which he ruled, the Hindu dharma-·<193>stras ç
ordained that the land did not belong to him as he was only its ç
trustee. However he could have a private property built up from the ç
funds allotted to him in the management of the State. Consequently ç
he could give gifts only from this!
@SPACE1 = 
The king had a fixed, but strenuous, daily routine. Sufficient time ç
was allotted for all legitimate activities such as these: examining ç
the income and expenditure position, preparing a balanced budget, ç
tax-collections, planning welfare schemes for the people, consultations ç
with the ministers, secret meeting with the spies bringing information, ç
inspection of the armed forces and consultation with its officers, ç
spending some time with the family members and personal prayers.
It goes without saying that elaborate and strict arrangements were ç
made for the personal safety of the king.
Kings  who  aspired  to  become emperors cherished a great desire ç
to perform sacrifices like the R<193>jas<220>ya or A·vamedha.
@S8ITAL = MANTRIPARI<186>AD (Council of Ministers)
The ministry was usually in two tiers †the inner or core group and ç
the outer, larger, council. The inner, the core, group comprised the ç
crown-prince, the prime minister, the royal preceptor (r<193>jaguru) ç
and the commander-in-chief. All policy decisions and framing of laws ç
were done by this inner group. The outer circle could consist of 8 ç
to 23, or even more, persons. They were important officers and heads ç
of departments. This outer circle was mainly concerned with the implementation ç
of the decisions taken by the inner circle.
The king was advised not to go against the majority decisions.
@S8ITAL = JANAPADA (People)
Since  the  kingdom,  the  entire governmental system, is meant for ç
the welfare of the people, they must be kept happy and contented. ç
For this they need security and all opportunities for development. ç
The primary means of achieving this is by giving them food, clothing, ç
shelter,   health-care,   education   and avenues for employment. ç
Hence, the king and his government must support and encourage  all  organizations  of  public ç
service such as trade guilds, labour unions, educational institutions ç
and self-government agencies like the pa<210>c<193>yats. As far as ç
possible, all welfare activities must be undertaken through them or ç
with their cooperation.
@S8ITAL = DURGA AND BALA (Forts and Armed Forces)
During  those  days,  forts  were extremely  important  for  the  defence ç
system. They used to be built in important places, including the inaccessible ç
ones, for emergencies. Vantage points were always preferred. They ç
would have outer and inner structures, secret tunnels, proper places ç
for the soldiers, weapons, treasury, food and other essential commodities, ç
and even secret places for hiding. Food and essential commodities ç
were always kept in stock.
The  espionage  system  was  well- organized.
There were proper provisions and methods for the raising and training ç
of the armed forces which consisted of four divisions: infantry, cavalry, ç
chariot-force and elephant-force.
Since ship-building was well-known even in the early period, powerful ç
navies formed part of the armed forces.
During wars and invasions, very strict rules were followed. A few ç
of these are:
The soldiers should not fight with unarmed persons. Weak persons, ç
women and children, sick people and refugees must never be harmed. ç
No damage should be caused to agricultural fields and civilian industries. ç
There should be no looting or molestation in the conquered territory. ç
Local religions and customs must be honoured  and  never  interfered  with. ç
Closest relative of the conquered king, if found fit, may be installed ç
as the new king. He was to be a s<193>manta (feudatory chief) paying ç
tributes and supplying the army when the conquering king needs it. ç
He had complete autonomy in all other respects.
People of the conquered country had to be befriended by proper means.
@S8ITAL = KO<185>A (Treasury)
No activity of the State can be undertaken unless there is enough ç
money and wealth to back it up. Hence, collection of taxes was a primary ç
duty of the State.
The taxes levied were generally light or moderate, and never heavy. ç
Land revenue was the main tax. Irrigation tax was also collected wherever ç
irrigation had been provided. The tax was generally one-sixth or one-fifth ç
of the produce. Arts,crafts and trades were also taxed. Religious  and  educational  institutions, ç
disabled persons, unemployed people, s<193>dhus (recluses and monks) ç
and br<193>hma<207>as (devoted to Vedic learning and an austere life) ç
were exempted. During droughts, famines and other national emergencies ç
taxes were either abolished or deferred.
Emergency funds were built up in a separate treasury and were never ç
touched except in grave and critical situations.*
There was a constant and strict supervision of accounts. Tax-collectors ç
were expected to behave humanely and invited severe punishments for ç
cruelty.
The tax money was apportioned to various  public  purposes  by  proper ç
budgetary procedures.
@SPACE = 
@S8ITAL = MITRA (Ally)
@SPACE1 = 
For the consolidation of the State and help in emergencies, friends ç
and allies were considered absolutely necessary. The first two of ç
the four up<193>yas or means, viz., s<193>ma (a spirit of reconciliation) ç
and d<193>na (the spirit of give and take), come in handy in this ç
regard. (The other two† bheda [splitting the enemy ranks] and da<207><195>a ç
[violent means including war]† were meant to be used against enemies ç
and that too as a last resort.)
Potential enemies, when not amenable to s<193>ma and d<193>na, were ç
to be neutralized.
Friendly countries were to be helped in their hour of need. Pacts ç
signed were strictly honoured. There was to be no invasion on a king ç
who was virtuous and was ruling according to dharma!
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Some Salient Features
@SPACE1 = 
It will be interesting to note some more salient features of the Hindu ç
political system here.
Though the king generally appointed all the important officers of ç
the State, local officers in the villages and towns were elected by ç
the people, the process of election being described in detail in the ç
concerned works. The central government never interfered in the local ç
affairs. Thelocal customs and traditions were honoured.
The system of census, not only of people but also of domesticated ç
animals, existed.
Administration of justice was in the hands of upright and important ç
officers. The var<207>a-<193>·rama-dharmas and the duties of the various ç
castes were enforced as strictly as possible. However there was also ç
the freedom to choose one's profession.
Punishments of various types for the transgression of the laws†both ç
civil and criminal†existed. They ranged from finesand confiscation ç
of property up to banishment and even death.
All efforts were made to maintain peace in the society since it was ç
conducive to the development of culture.
Temples and places of worship were looked upon with respect and jealously ç
guarded.
It is thus seen that the political system of Hindu India was never ç
inferior to any other similar system in the world.

7.	Hindu Economics
@S10 = Importance of Artha or Wealth
`A sound mind in a sound body' is a sound saying. We can perhaps adopt ç
it to describe a welfare State as: `A sound State in a sound economy!' ç
And, what is economy but the art of spending less than what is earned? ç
Does it not prove to be the philosopher's stone ultimately?
The proverbial wealth of ancient andearly medieval India as eloquently ç
described by many a foreign traveller was not a little due to the ç
wholesome economic policies of the State as well as the industriousness ç
of its people. The basis of this was the philosophy of the four puru<218><193>rthas†ends ç
or goals of human life †which gave artha or wealth also a decent place ç
in life, though subservient to dharma or righteousness.
@SPACE1 = 
Wealth, called `artha', is material in form. It can be acquired and ç
consumed. Since it can become scarce unlike air or water, is attractive!
@SPACE1 = 
Goddess Lak<218>m<200> is the presiding deity of wealth. Allegorically ç
speaking, material wealth, professions that bring wealth and persons ç
practising those professions are the three legs of the tripod upon ç
which the goddess rests. Hindu works dealing with the artha-·<193>stra ç
(the science of wealth) cover all these aspects.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Characteristics of Hindu Economics
@SPACE1 = 
The general characteristics of Hindu economics may be stated as follows:
@SPACE1 = 
The entire State or the society is more important than the individual. ç
Hence, the individual good may have to be, sometimes, sacrificed for ç
the good of the society as a whole.
@SPACE1 = 
Economic polices should not generally go against the principles of ç
dharma though it may not always be possible to follow all of them ç
strictly.
@SPACE1 = 
There  are  quite  a  few  special characteristics too. They are, ç
according to the Artha·<193>stra of Kau<219>ilya (300 <MS>B.C.<D>):<192>
@SPACE1 = 
Though the State as a whole should be given supreme importance vis-a-vis ç
the subjects, it was obligatory on its part to:
@SPACE = 
@SPACE = 
@NO = 1)
@NOK = treat the subjects as its children and devise welfare schemes ç
for them;
@NO = 2)
@NOK = help them in periods of crises like war  and  natural  calamities  like ç
famine, floods, earthquake etc.;
@SPACE1 = 
@NO = 3)
@NOK = moderate the prices of commodities so that people are not exploited;
@SPACE1 = 
@NO = 4)
@NOK = control the quality of goods;
@SPACE1 = 
@NO = 5)
@NOK = help trade and commerce by providing means of transport, communication, ç
security, tax-concessions in foreign trade and so on;
@SPACE1 = 
@NO = 6)
@NOK = protect agriculture in all its aspects;
@SPACE1 = 
@NO = 7)
@NOK = create  job-opportunities  for  the people.
@SPACE = 
We thus see that all the important economic aspects of a modern welfare ç
Stateare covered by this scheme.
@S10 = Planning and Budgeting
Planning a properly balanced budget was a very important aspect of ç
administration. Revenue from various sources had to be estimated and ç
allotment of funds for essential expenditure made by the State officials, ç
personally supervised bythe king himself. Daily checking of accounts ç
by competent authorities was recommended.
Land revenue seems to have been the major source of income. Generally, ç
one-sixth of the produce was collected in kind. Excellent irrigation ç
system is known to have existed even during Candragupta Maurya's time ç
(325 <MS>B.C.<D>). Hence irrigation cess was also laid where it had ç
been provided.
Other sources of income were trade, commerce, industry and mines. ç
The rate of taxation used to be around one-tenth. Sometimes, a few ç
mines and industries were also run directly by the governments to ç
augment their income. Defence industries were directly under the State. ç
Forest wealth also was tapped by the government itself. The concept ç
of nationalisation was not unknown.
Apart from fines levied for the transgressions of the laws of the ç
land, special cesses collected during emergencies like war or victory ç
expeditions were also a source of income.
Before levying a tax, the king was expected to study the time, place ç
and circumstances connected with it. The level of taxation had to ç
be bearable and not hurt the people too much. Though enough income ç
had to be generated for the State, means and methods employed were ç
to be fair and just.
Details regarding expenditure given in the Hindu works on political ç
science and economics are, comparatively speaking, less than those ç
concerning income. Major part of the income†sometimes ashigh as 50%†was ç
apportioned for defence, including internal law and order. Unsettled ç
conditions in the country due to frequent foreign invasions as also ç
ambitions of the rulers for conquests might have been responsible ç
for this. A lot of money was therefore spent on building up and the ç
training of the five limbs of the armed forces, the stores, secret ç
services, armoury and so on.
A reserve fund for emergencies had to be built up by saving one-sixth ç
or one-fourth of the income. A part had also to be given as privy-purse ç
to the king for his personal expenses.
Other items of expenditure were almost the same as we have today: ç
general administration, department of justice, roads and bridges as ç
also navigation, grants to local self-governments, religious and  cultural  institutions,  hospitals, ç
maintenance of orphans and other helpless persons.
Banking system was well-organized. Loans usually carried an interest ç
of 15% or even more.
@S10 = Trade and Commerce
Trade and commerce†both internal and external†were very flourishing ç
even in the pre-Christian era. Contacts had been established with ç
China, Mongolia, Japan, Korea, Egypt, Troy, Babylonia, Assiria, Greece, ç
Crete, Rome, Mexico and other countries.
Trade by sea was thriving well. Several seaports have been mentioned ç
in the ancient works including the Buddhist J<193>taka tales and travellers' ç
accounts. The Vijayanagar empire itself had 300 ports!
Great encouragement was given to foreign trade by providing tax-concessions ç
and other facilities. The passport-visa system existed. Foreigners ç
coming for trade were given sufficient protection.
The transport and communication system kept pace with trade.
@S10 = Merchant Organizations
There were trade-guilds and merchant-organizations of several types ç
known by different nomenclatures such as: ·re<207><200>, mah<193>n<193><195>u, ç
ma<207>ima<209>gala, sa<209>gha, p<220>ga and ga<207>a. They had their ç
special constitutions to control their professions in all aspects. ç
They were even permitted to have their own private armies. They were ç
quite powerful in national life. The rulers rarely interfered with ç
their working.
@S10 = Arts and Crafts
A large number of arts and crafts have been mentioned in the ancient ç
and medieval works thereby signifying a high degree of industrial ç
development. Some of them, for instance, are: weaving, laundry, tailoring, ç
carpentry, oil-extraction, goldsmithy, blacksmithy, flower-garland ç
making, mat-making, leather industry, potmaking and so on. These crafts ç
were generally assigned to or undertaken by the castes known for them. ç
In bigger towns and cities there were separate streets for each craft ç
and its products. Finished goods were examined by experts and seals ç
were put on them for certifying the quality. If and when necessary, ç
prices were also controlled.
Partnerships in general, and also between the capitalists and workmen, ç
existed.  They  were  well-regulated  by appropriate laws and rules.
@S10 = Units of Money and Measurements
Coins made of gold, silver and copper did exist even by 600 <MS>B.C.<D>, ç
and were used as money, though the barter system too existed, perhaps, ç
side by side. Known bysuch names as hira<207>yapi<207><195>a, ni<218>ka, ç
suvar<207>a, ·atam<193>na, p<193>da, pur<193><207>a, k<193>r<218><193>pa<207>a ç
and pa<207>a, they were of various shapes†square, rectangular and ç
circular. Certain signs and symbols were embossed on these coins, ç
some of which resemble the Harappan seals. Tables of values of these ç
coins have been given in some books like the L<200>l<193>vat<200> ç
of Bh<193>skara (12th cent.)
Units of measurement whether of length (like a<209>gula, hasta or ç
yojana), or of weight (like gu<210>ja, pala and dro<207>a) orof time ç
(like nime<218>a, k<218>a<207>a or gha<219>ik<193>) had also been ç
well-developed. It is interesting to note that the unit of length ç
(or scale) shown by the sculptor of the image of Goma<219>e·vara at ç
<185>rava<207>abe<202>ago<202>a (Karna-taka) is almost the same as ç
the French meter!
@S10 = Epilogue
At a time when the average Indian's admiration for the West is growing ç
at an alarming pace, that too at the cost of one's national pride ç
and self-respect, an earnest study of our ancient and medieval history ç
can be of great help to boost it.
A sound economic philosophy, expansive trade and commerce, well-organized ç
trade-guilds, a good coinage system, sensi-ble taxation laws, building ç
up reserves for emergencies†which have characterised our political ç
and social administration, should instil righteous pride in the mind ç
and heart of every true Indian.

8.	The Hindu Judicial System
@S10 = Introduction
No society can survive for long, despite immense wealth and military ç
might, if it does not have a proper system of jurisprudence that can ç
give justice impartially to all its members. Impartiality is the life ç
of justice, and justice, of good government. There can never be any ç
justice without mature wisdom which alone knows how to strike a balance ç
between individual liberty and social good. This is exactly what the ç
sources of Hindu law have done, right from the Vedas upto the sm<216>tis ç
and dharma·<193>stras, as also the various nibandhas (digests).
However, the Artha·<193>stra of Kau<219>ilya (300 <MS>B.C.<D>) being ç
the oldest among the best organized works on secular codes of law, ç
can throw a lot of light on Hindu jurisprudence. It refers to more ç
than 12authors of the earlier period. It mayhence be safely relied ç
upon while discussing or presenting this subject.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Origin of the Hindu Judicial System
@SPACE1 = 
`Sabh<193>s' were known to have existed even from the Vedic times. ç
They were judicial assemblies consisting of good people†called V<216>ddhas ç
or the wise ones† who were experts in the observance of satya  (truth)  and  dharma  (righteous ç
conduct).
Four kinds of courts of justice are sometimes described in the ancient ç
works: prati<218><219>hit<193> (one established in a place), aprati<218><219>hit<193> ç
(a mobile court), mudrit<193> (the court of a judge appointed by the ç
king who is authorised to use the royal seal) and ·<193>sit<193> or ç
·<193>strit<193> (the court in which the king himself presides).
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Independence of the Judiciary
@SPACE1 = 
The outstanding feature of the judiciary in any civilized society ç
is its independence from the control of the executive. This has jealously ç
been guarded by the Hindu works on political science. According to ç
them even the prince is equal to a private citizen before law. This ç
is because dharma is considered supreme and inviolable!
As at present, the judges used to beappointed from among the lawyers. ç
Generally br<193>hma<207>as of learning and character were selected, ç
though members of other castes also could be appointed ifqualified. ç
The qualifications generally insisted upon were: self-control, reputation ç
of the family (from which he comes) for satya and dharma, impartiality, ç
absence of excitement, steadfastness and energy in the performance ç
of duties.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = The Court
@SPACE1 = 
The court generally comprised of a judge who presided and an odd number ç
of juries (3 or 5 or 7). Persons well-versed in law were often invited ç
to attend the Sabh<193> (or meeting) and were expected to speak if ç
called upon to do so. However, there was to be no public participation.
Though the king might be present he would not decide the cases directly.His ç
council would include the Chief Justice. He would of course see that ç
the sentence, once pronounced, is carried out faithfully.
Full records of the proceedings were kept. Justice was administered ç
openly. Earlier judgements were given due weightage before new ones ç
were delivered.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = System of Judiciary and<R>ç
Judicial Administration
@SPACE1 = 
The Chief Justice (called pr<193><195>viv<193>ka) and Minister of ç
Justice (known as dharm<193>dhikara<207>a) formed the core of the ç
judicial system and of the judicial administration. The Chief Justice ç
presided over the Supreme Court at the capital. The Minister of Justice ç
prescribed the law and the procedure after consulting the jury.
Before finally deciding a case, all material connected with pratyak<218>a ç
(direct evidence), anum<193>na (inference) and upam<193>na (analogy) ç
were to be gathered and thoroughly examined.
Justice was meted out at several levels with a provision for appeal ç
to the next higher authority. They were:
1) The Kula Courts: They consisted of kinsmen only and were confined ç
to personal and family laws and customs.
2) The <185>re<207><200> Courts: They comprised representatives ç
of traders and artisans belonging to different tribes but practising ç
the same profession.
3) The P<220>ga Courts: They were an assemblage of townsmen or meetings ç
of persons belonging to various tribes and professions, but inhabiting ç
the same place.
The decisions of the Kula courts could be revised by the <185>re<207><200> ç
courts and of the <185>re<207><200> courts by the P<220>ga courts. ç
The court of the pr<193><195>viv<193>ka was the next higher authority, ç
the court of the monarch or the sovereign being the highest.
There were also the Ga<207>a courts, courts administering the laws ç
of the Hindu republics which have been praised highlyby the Greek ç
writers on India. The laws framed by these courts were called `samaya' ç
(decision taken together in an assembly).
@S10 = Judicial Procedure
No civil action could be started without a complaint, which again, ç
could be lodged only by the aggrieved person. A regular petition to ç
the court was necessary. This was taken down by a `lekhaka' or a writer, ç
well-versed in the legal terms. He could put questions to the plaintiff ç
for clarifications if necessary. Then  summons  were  issued  to  the ç
concerned  person.  Obedience  to  the summons was enforced, by sanctions ç
or legal restraint, called `<193>sedha'.
This restraint could be of four kinds, as to: sth<193>na or place; ç
prav<193>sa or journey; time or period; and, certain actions. In other ç
words, till the dispute was settled, the defendant (or respondent) ç
should not go out of his house or place of residence, should not undertake ç
any journey, should present himself at the court on the day and at ç
the time fixed for it and should not do certain actions connected ç
with the dispute.
The plaintiff was required to repeat the charges in detail in the ç
presence of the defendant. This was taken down again by the lekhaka. ç
Any discrepancy between the earlier and later versions of the complaint ç
could lead to the dismissal of the case.
Pleading had to be precise, comprehensive,  unequivocal,  consistent  and ç
susceptible of proof.
Defence had to be confined only to the   points   raised,   answers   being ç
unhesitating, clear and consistent.
The defence could take any one of these four forms: 1) Confession; ç
2) Denial; 3) Special exception; 4) Plea of a former judgement.
The   judicial   proceedings   were generally in four stages: the ç
plaint, the reply, the trial and the deliberations followed by a decree.
There were rules guiding the trial. A surety had to be given by both ç
the parties before the trial. The plaintiff had the right to begin ç
the arguments but had to give enough evidence in support of his cause. ç
Counter claims by the defendant were not entertained until the original ç
case was disposed off.
@SPACE1 = 
Once a litigation was started, the parties involved could not evolve ç
any compromise formula between themselves without the consent of the ç
court.
There were rules concerning evidence. Generally three types of evidence ç
were recognised: 1) documents; 2) witnesses; 3)conduct.
Of conduct, possession was always taken  as  evidence  giving  rise  to  a ç
presumption of title.
Persons coming from respectable families, deeply religious by temperament ç
and hence devoted to truth, who were straightforward  were  considered  as ç
reliable witnesses.
Interesting descriptions of an untruthful witness are given. Some ç
of them are: shifting the position constantly; licking the corner ç
of one's own lips; sweat on the forehead; change of colour of the ç
countenance; faltering speech; contradictory statements.
@S10 = Judgement
The judgement†called vidh<193>na or jayapatra†was given at the end ç
of thetrial. Enough time was taken for considering all the aspects ç
of the case. But unnecessary delays were also avoided.
A typical judgement was expected tocontain:
a)
@NK = a summary of the proceedings;
b)
@NK = evidence of all the concerned parties;
c)
@NK = deliberations thereon, by the court;
d)
@NK = the law applicable in the case; and
e)
@NK = the signature of the judge with the royal seal.
@S10 = Punishment
Equality of all, before the law of the land, was not only stressed, ç
but also vigorously implemented. Even the king was not exempted. In ç
fact, for the same offence, persons with higher social status were ç
given more severe punishments. The principle was: greater the position ç
and authority, greater were the responsibility and the standard of ç
behaviour expected.
Punishment  meted  out  was  of variouskinds andtypes: public censure ç
and rebuke; fines and confiscation of property; banishment; corporal ç
punishment including branding or severing limbs or even death.
The primary object of punishment was always the protection of the ç
law- abiding people. If the evil-doers were kept under check by the ç
fear of punishment, the chances of social security and order would ç
be much more.
@S10 = Conclusion
The Hindu judicial system, many of whose features are found even in ç
the modern days, offers a good field of research. Its findings can ç
certainly enrich our field of jurisprudence helping us further towards ç
the goal of ideal justice through human agencies.
@SB = <R>ç
9.	Contribution of the<R>ç
	Hindus to Science
@S10 = Introduction
The contribution of Hindu India to the field of science is no less ç
significant than its contribution to the field of spiritual wisdom. ç
The sages of India never considered religion and science as two conflicting ç
areas of knowledge. To them both were equally important, one being ç
the quest for the truth within and the other, without. They were actually ç
two facets of the same vidy<193> or science. Thatiswhy they were ç
called par<193>vidy<193> (higher knowledge) and apar<193>vidy<193> ç
(lower knowledge).
The word `<216><218>i'†generally translated as a `sage'†just signifies ç
a man of knowledge, in any field for that matter, since it is derived ç
from the root verb `<216><218>' (`to know'). Thus, if Vasi<218><219>ha ç
and Vy<193>sa were <216><218>is in the field of spiritual wisdom, ç
Dhanvantari, Var<193>hamihira and Bh<193>skara were <216><218>is in ç
the fields of medicine, astronomy and mathematics.
One thing which was basic to allthese <216><218>is was that their ç
j<210><193>na or knowledge was always meant to be used within the ç
perimeters of dharma, for the universal good of mankind.
It is necessary to stress one more point here. The discovery by these ç
sages that Brahman, the basis of the external universe and °tman, ç
the basis of the internal world, are ultimately one and arepure consciousness, ç
has obliterated the walls between these two fields of knowledge.
A brief account of the various sciences as developed in this country ç
during the ancient and medieval ages may now be given, arranging them ç
in the English alphabetical order for easy reference.
@S10 = Architecture and Town Planning
The  Harappa  and  Mohenjad<193>ro excavations (3000 <MS>B.C.<D>) ç
and the ancient temples (<MS>A.D.<D> 325)†including the cave temples†have ç
shown the highly developed state of Hindu architecture and town planning. ç
There is a lot of advanced scientific literature on these subjects ç
such as: M<193>nas<193>ra, Mayamata, M<193>nasoll<193>sa, Sanatkum<193>ra ç
V<193>stu·<193>stra and so on. Some of the pur<193><207>as like Vi<218><207>udharmottara ç
also deal with these subjects.
The word `V<193>stu·ilpa' used to indicate this science is comprehensive ç
in scope and includes all types of building construction, forts and ç
other military structures as alsotown planning. The burnt bricks, ç
wood-work, houses, wells, public tanks, sewerage system, swimming ç
pools and granaries discovered at the Harappan sites bespeak of the ç
highly developed state of this science.
Megasthanes (300 <MS>B.C.<D>) has given aninteresting account of ç
Candragupta's palace, fort and other structures. Thest<220>pas and ç
pillars<|>* of A·oka, the various images of Buddha and the cave architecture ç
belonging to the Mauryan Period (3rd century <MS>B.C.<D>) stand as ç
monumental proof of the development of architecture of that period.
Apart from buildings like palaces or defence structures like the forts, ç
temples have always been a source of strength and inspiration for ç
the rulers of Hindu India. Hence there was a steady growth of temples†both ç
in quality and in artistry †over the centuries. The temples of the ç
Gupta period (4th to 7th centuries <MS>A.D.<D>), the temples of Bhubaneshwar ç
and Puri as also Konarak in Orissa (8th to 13th centuries <MS>A.D.<D>) ç
are cases to the point. The huge temples of South India built by the ç
various dynasties like the Pallavas (7thto 10th centuries <MS>A.D.<D>), ç
the Co<202>as (10th to 12th centuries <MS>A.D.<D>), by the Vijayanagara ç
kings (14th to 16th centuries <MS>A.D.<D>) and by the N<193>yaks of ç
Madurai (17th century <MS>A.D.<D>) are monuments of marvel. Mention ç
should also be made of the cave temples of B<193>d<193>mi(in Karnataka) ç
belonging to the 6th century <MS>A.D.<D>, the Goma<219>e·vara image ç
cut out of a single rock of granite (nearly 20 metres or 57 ft. in ç
height) in 983 <MS>A.D.<D> and the famous temples at Belur, Halebid ç
and Somanathpur (all in Karnataka) known for their exquisite carvings ç
in stone (12th century <MS>A.D.<D>) built by the Hoysa<202>as.
@S10 = Astronomy
At a time when Vedic sacrifices were all important, there was a great ç
need to determine the correct times for performing them. This gave ç
rise to a new branch of knowledge called `Jyoti<218>a' or `Jyauti<218>a' ç
which was deemed as a Ved<193><209>ga, a subsidiary science of Veda. ç
This was the origin of Hindu astronomy and dates back to 1400 <MS>B.C.<D> ç
The Vedic sages were fully aware of the following astronomical facts ç
and phenomena:
1)
@NK = The earth is round, rotates onits own axis and also round the ç
sun.
2)
@NK = Sunlight  has  seven  colours, allegorically described as seven ç
horses.
3)
@NK = The twelve signs of the zodiac.
4)
@NK = There are 366 days in a year.
5)
@NK = The number of days per month is 29<P8M><|><P7W1><$E16 over 21><P8> ç
<P255D>or 29.762.
The S<220>ryasiddh<193>nta, considered as a revealed work, is the ç
earliest of the available works on Hindu astronomy. It was thoroughly ç
revised by Var<193>hamihira (6th century <MS>A.D.<D>). The works attributed ç
to him are: B<216>hajj<193>taka, Laghuj<193>taka, Pa<210>casiddh<193>ntik<193> ç
and B<216>hatsa<221>hit<193>. Other great names in the field are: ç
°ryabha<219>a I (b. <MS>A.D.<D> 476), Brahmagupta (7th century <MS>A.D.<D>) ç
and Bh<193>skara (12th century <MS>A.D.<D>)
@S10 = Botany
A  fairly  good  knowledge  of  the botanical sciences existed in ç
the Hindu India not only in the post-Vedic period, but also in the ç
Vedic. The Vedic °ryans were aware of what is now termed `photosynthesis.' ç
The Artha·<193>stra of Kau<219>ilya  (300 <MS>B.C.<D>)  refers  to  gulma- ç
v<216>k<218>a-<193>yurveda (science of bushy plants and trees). A ç
lot of information regarding soils, seed selection, sowing, germination, ç
grafting and cutting, rotation of crops, plant classification and ç
so on, is found insome pur<193><207>as like the Agnipur<193><207>a ç
(<MS>A.D.<D>800).
An account of the different parts of a plant body like the roots and ç
shoots, stem and branches, leaves, flowers andfruits are found in ç
the <184>gveda, Atharva-veda, Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> ç
and V<193>jasaney<200> Sa<221>hit<193>.
Indian literature of the post-Vedic period (600 <MS>B.C.<D><192><MS>A.D.<D> ç
600) bears ample evidence to a knowledge of morphology, physiology, ç
ecology and taxonomy of plants. The famous Sanskrit lexicon, the Amarako<218>a ç
of Amarasi<221>ha (<MS>A.D.<D> 400), has enumerated more than three ç
hundred species of plants. Medicinal herbs and plants naturally received ç
great attention due to their being closely associated with °yurveda, ç
the science of medicine and surgery. All the methods of propagation ç
now known to us were common knowledge. To mention a few: propagation ç
by seeds,roots, cuttings, graftings and leaves. Treatises such as ç
Artha·<193>stra, B<216>hatsa<221>hit<193> and Manusa<221>hit<193> ç
refer to all of them.
Plants had been regarded, even from the Vedic times, as living organisms.
In the naming of plants, a rational and scientific procedure was followed, ç
which was in no way inferior to the modern methods.
During the medieval period (<MS>A.D.<D> 600 to 1500) botanical research†including ç
the possibilities of developing new species† got further fillip, as ç
evidenced in the <185><193>r<209>gadhara Paddhati of <185><193>r<209>gadhara ç
(14th century).
@S10 = Chemistry
The beginnings of the science of chemistry in India may be traced ç
to the philosophical speculations of certain schools like the Ny<193>ya-Vai·e<218>ika ç
and development of certain practical arts likedecorated earthenware ç
and porcelain, burnt bricks, glass beads, alloys and medicines, which ç
presuppose a practical knowledge  of  the  chemical  processes involved.
The Ny<193>ya-Vai·e<218>ika schools put forth the atomic theory of ç
matter, the permutation and combination of which atomic particles ç
ultimately lead to the whole creation.
The  people  of  the  Indus  Valley Civilization (2500 <MS>B.C.<D>) ç
were skilled in employing a wide range of chemical processes. Materials ç
recovered from the excavation   sites   at   Harappa   and Mohenjod<193>ro ç
such as water-pots, vessels, earthenware, pottery (ordinary and glazed), ç
jewellery and seals, confirm this conclusion.
References to tanning of hides, dyeing of garments with certain natural ç
vegetable colouring materials and to preparation of fermented drinks ç
found in the Vedic texts bespeak of a knowledge of chemistry, however ç
elementary that may be.
There was a phenomenal growth of °yurveda, the science of medicine ç
and surgery, during the period 600 <MS>B.C.<D><192><MS>A.D.<D> 800. ç
This automatically led to the develop-ment of the science of chemistry ç
too.
The fact that chemical reactions generated heat and vice versa was ç
known even by <MS>A.D.<D> 400.
The Artha·<193>stra of Kau<219>ilya (300 <MS>B.C.<D>) and the Sa<221>hit<193>s ç
of Caraka (<MS>A.D.<D> 300) and Su·ruta (<MS>A.D.<D> 500) contain ç
a wealth of information regarding chemistry also,along with that ç
of metallurgy and medicine. Procedures for extracting and purifying ç
metals like gold, silver, copper and lead, preparation of various ç
kinds of fermented liquors and anhydrous alcohol by distillation, ç
formation of sulphides, preparation  and  properties  of  alkali carbonates ç
and caustic alkali as well as of neutralization of the alkali by an ç
acid†these and many more things have been described in these works. ç
Other subjects referred to are: processes of calcination, distillation, ç
sublimation, and steaming; grouping of organic substances; vegetable ç
as well as animal oils; poisons of several varieties and so on.
An elaborate discussion about the chemistry of digestion of food in ç
human beings is found in the Carakasa<221>hit<193> and A<218><219><193><209>gah<216>daya-sa<221>hit<193> ç
of V<193>gbha<219>a II (<MS>A.D.<D> 650).
The process of melting, refining, and colouring glass was known even ç
as early as the sixth century <MS>B.C.<D> as borne out by the discovery ç
of the earliest specimen of glass at the Bhirmound in Tak<218>a·il<193> ç
or Taxila (now in Pakistan). The art of making painted, decorated ç
and glazed pottery was current even by 300 <MS>B.C.<D> So also the ç
use of indigo, lac, turmeric, resin and red ochre.
In medieval India, the rise of T<193>ntric cults interested in alchemy ç
gave a further push to the development of the chemical sciences and ç
engineering. Preparation of an elixir of life and conversion of base ç
metals  into  gold  were  the  twofold objectives of the alchemists.
The Ras<193>r<207>ava (12th cent.), the Dh<193>tuv<193>da (8th ç
cent.), the Rasendra-c<220><195><193>ma<207>i (13th cent.) were ç
some of the treatises composed during the middle-ages which dealt ç
with subjects like extraction of copper, purification of mercury by ç
distillation, making of cuprous sulphide and sulphuric acid.
Though chemistry was developed more as a handmaid of other streams ç
of knowledge like the health sciences or mining and metallurgy, the ç
contribution of ancient and medieval India to it is significant.
@S10 = Mathematics
The  Vedic  Hindus  were  deeply devoted to y<193>gas or sacrifices. ç
Performance of these sacrifices needed a fair degree ofknowledge ç
in two fields of science: geometry and astronomy. The former was needed ç
in designing and building suitable Vedis or altars, generally with ç
bricks. The latter became necessary while fixing the correct time ç
or period for the performance of the sacrifice itself. The <185>ulbas<220>tras ç
developed the former and the Jyauti<218>a, the latter. Signs for numbers, ç
counting up to very huge quantities like par<193>rdha (1014), the ç
decimal and the duodecimal systems, the concept of zero and infinity, ç
quadratic equations, surds and indeterminate analysis were all familiar ç
subjects to the ancient and medieval Hindus.
Another unique development in India has been the use of word-numerals ç
such as kha, <193>k<193>·a (the sky or space) or ·<220>nya (void) ç
to represent zero, k<218>iti, dhar<193> and p<216>thv<200> (the earth) ç
to represent the figure1 and so on. This system has enabled theauthors ç
of mathematical treatises to versify their ideas and express them ç
concisely.
The methods of extracting the square and the cube roots of integral ç
numbers can be traced to °ryabha<219>a I (<MS>A.D.<D> 499) and Brahmagupta ç
(7th cent. <MS>A.D.<D>).
So far about arithmetic.
Let us now turn to algebra.
The construction of sacrificial altars and the arrangements for laying ç
bricks for them posed serious problems to the Vedic °ryans. While ç
attempting to solve them, they discovered geometrical methods of algebra. ç
The <185>ulbas<220>tras of °pastamba (400 <MS>B.C.<D>), Baudh<193>yana ç
(600 <MS>B.C.<D>), K<193>ty<193>-yana<|>(<MS>A.D.<D> 400) and others ç
give the solutions of linear, quadratic, simultaneous or even indeterminate ç
equations.
Algebra was called `Ku<219><219>akaga<207>ita' first. The term `B<200>jaga<207>ita' ç
used in the modern period was given by one P<216>th<220>daka Sv<193>min ç
(<MS>A.D.<D> 860).
In the Sth<193>n<193><209>gas<220>tras (100 <MS>B.C.<D>) simple, ç
quadratic and cubic equations are given.
Coming to geometry as such, it had its origin in the building of Vedic ç
sacrificial altars. The so-called Pythagoras theorem had already been ç
enunciated by Baudh<193>-yana (600 <MS>B.C.<D>). Problems like the ç
area of a quadrilateral or the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral ç
have been successfully solved by Brahmagupta in his Brahmasphu<219>a-siddh<193>nta.
Trigonometry evolved as an integral part of Astronomy. The functions ç
of sine and cosine were called `jy<193>' and `kojy<193>'. Anumber ç
of elementary formulae†such as sin (90-<F128M>q<F255D><|>) = cos<|><F128M>q<F255D><|>; ç
sin 2<F128M>q<F255D> = z sin cos<F128M>q<F255D><|>†as also trigonometrical series ç
had also been developed.
Rudimentary ideas of Integral and Differential calculus are found ç
in the works of Brahmagupta and Bh<193>skara II (<MS>A.D.<D> 1150).
It is thus seen that the Hindus of ancient and medieval India were ç
familiar with almost all branches of mathematical sciences to a greater ç
or lesser extent.
@S10 = Medicine and Surgery
A sound body is fit to house a sound mind. A balanced combination ç
of these two is in a far better position to manifest the spirit within†the ç
<193>tman†which is always sound! Realizing this, a great and useful ç
science of health in all its aspects, called  `°yurveda'  or  the  Science  of ç
Longevity, was handed over to us by Brahm<193> the Creator, through ç
the twin deities A·vins and then the sages like Bharadv<193>ja. This ç
is how Hindu tradition traces the origin of the medical sciences.
Though the elements of °yurveda are found even in the <184>gveda, ç
it is in the Atharvaveda that a more detailed and a systematic account ç
is found. Treatment of diseases like leucoderma, leprosy, tuberculosis, ç
jaundice as also the sciences of dentistry, making and fixing of artificial ç
limbs, means of virilification and treatment of the diseases of the ç
eye were known to exist. A fairly good practical knowledge of human ç
physiology was possessed by the vaidyas or the doctors. Even transplantation ç
of eye-ball has been mentioned in some works!
Among the best known classical texts of °yurveda are the Sa<221>hit<193>s ç
of Caraka (<MS>A.D.<D> 200) and Su·ruta (<MS>A.D.<D> 400). The A<218><219><193><209>gah<216>daya ç
of V<193>gbha<219>a II (early 8th century) is another well-known and ç
authoritative treatise.
The standard texts generally deal with a<218><219><193><209>gas or ç
eight subjects. They are: K<193>yacikits<193> (therapeutics), <185>alyatantra ç
(major  surgery),  <185><193>l<193>kyatantra  (minor surgery  including  <MS>E.N.T.<D>),  Bh<220>tavidy<193> ç
(psychiatry),     Kaum<193>rabh<216>tya-tantra (paediatrics), Agadatantra ç
(toxicology), Ras<193>yana-tantra (geriatrics) and V<193>j<200>-kara<207>a-tantra ç
(virilification).
Some additional information given in these texts as also the Artha·<193>stra ç
of Kau<219>ilya may now be listed: details of the various bones and ç
n<193>l<193>s or n<193><195><200>s (blood-vessels and nerves) in the ç
human body; duties of the toxicologists and nurses; rules and regulations ç
for the surgeons; certain modes and methods of treatment like the ç
application of oils and ointments; bandaging techniques; surgical ç
instruments and how to use them and so on.
Foreign travellers like Megasthanes (302-288 <MS>B.C.<D>) and Strabo ç
(54-24 <MS>B.C.<D>) have declared that: 1) the Hindus of India attained ç
longevity due to good food, pure air and good habits; 2) the Hindu ç
physicians and surgeons were greater experts in their field than their ç
contemporary Greeks; 3) even Alexander preferred to employ the Hindu ç
physicians to look after his army-men; 4) A·oka had established hospitals ç
not only for human beings but also for animals.
It is interesting to note that a very strict code of conduct has been ç
laid down in these medical works for the doctor. They are:
1) He should treat his patients to the best of his ability since they ç
trust him for their lives.
2) He should refuse to treat morally depraved persons since they are ç
a scourge to the society.
3) He should not take up terminal cases where he is sure that death ç
is imminent, as also refuse to treat persons suffering from incurable ç
diseases.
4) Once he agrees to treat a patient, he should provide him with proper ç
medical and nursing facilities and also treat him kindly.
5) He should never attend to a woman patient in the absence of her ç
husband or guardians.
6) All professional information should be kept strictly confidential.
Many of these Indian medical treatises were translated into the Arabic ç
language and their practices introduced into Europe by the Arab physicians.
@S10 = Military Science
Even from the most ancient times the Hindu soldiers of the various ç
armies of the Indian kings were wellknown for their valour as well ç
as the use of weapons. The weapons in use were bows and arrows, swords ç
and shields, lances, javelins and tridents, armours and similar objects ç
specially designed for combats and battles.
Chariots were greatly in use. Driving chariots during battles had ç
been developed into a special art. So also the use of horses and elephants. ç
The latter were employed like the modern tanks.
The use of words like ·ataghn<200> (that which kills one hundred persons ç
at a time) and sammohan<193>stra (a weapon that makes people unconscious) ç
have induced some scholars to presume that the use of cannons and ç
poison gases was also known.
The weapons were generally classified into three groups:
1)
@NK = Yantramukta†those discharged from a machine or mechanical device;
2)
@NK = Hastamukta†those discharged by hand;
3)
@NK = Mukt<193>mukta†those used by hand or discharged from hand.
The names of some weapons like vajra and <193>gney<193>stra give rise ç
to the surmise that fire-arms might have been in use. However, it ç
is difficult to come to any definite conclusion.
The detailed descriptions of the vy<220>has or formations of the armed ç
forces given in our epics, also help us to appreciate the degree of ç
perfection that our ancient and medieval military science had achieved.
@S10 = Mining and Metallurgy
Mining  for  precious  metals  and precious stones have been described ç
by Megasthanes as wellknown to the Hindus.
The archaeological excavations at Baragunda (Singhbhum), Mosabani ç
(Singhbhum), Agnigu<207><195>ala (Andhra Pradesh)  and  Wynad  (Kerala)  have ç
revealed extensive, abandoned, copper and gold mines.
Even the Vedic °ryans were familiar with the use of several metals ç
such as gold, silver, copper, lead, tin, bronze and iron. This presupposes ç
that they had a fair knowledge of mining and metallurgy.
The wrought-iron pillar at Delhi, near the Qutb Minar, assigned to ç
the period, early 4th century <MS>A.D.<D>, is considered as a marvel ç
even today. Not only its dimensions1 but also its rustless shining ç
surface, speak volumes about its quality and the technical perfection ç
attained by its makers. The copper image of Buddha2 found at Sultangunj ç
(Bihar) is another marvel. Huen Tsang (<MS>A.D.<D> 600-664) refers ç
to a colossal 24 metres (80 ft.) copper statue of Buddha established ç
by the king P<220>r<207>avarman near the N<193>land<193> University ç
in Bihar.
There is enough evidence to show that embossed or cast copper coins ç
were issued by the Mauryan and other kings.
Silver and gold jewellery with granulation and filigree work made ç
on copper and bronze moulds have been found at the Tak<218>a·il<193> ç
site (circa 3rd century <MS>B.C.<D>).
Thus, we can say that smelting of copper and other metals on an extensive ç
scale was known to the Hindus even about two thousand years ago.
Specimens of iron implements and a large variety of weapons discovered ç
at Tirunelveli or Tinnevelly (Tamil Nadu) have been assigned to the ç
period 4th century <MS>B.C.<D> Radio-carbon dating of some of the ç
samples of iron objects obtained in the archaeological excavations ç
in parts ofNorth India near Delhi varies from 1025 to 537 <MS>B.C.<D>
The king Porus is said to have gifted a piece of steel weighing 13.6 ç
kgs. (30lbs.) to Alexander. The Su·ruta Sa<221>hit<193> refers ç
to many surgical instruments made of steel. Indian steel used to be ç
exported to Western countries even at the beginning of  the  Christian  era  and  was  used ç
for preparing the famous Damascus blades.Var<193>hamihira (6th cent. ç
<MS>A.D.<D>) in his B<216>hatsa<221>hit<193> mentions about the ç
tempering of steel.
It can therefore be safely concluded that not only smelting of ores ç
but also preparation of various metallic objects were well-known to ç
the Hindus of ancient and medieval times.
@S10 = Veterinary Sciences
Being an agro-centered society, the Hindus depended heavily on cows, ç
bulls and other animals of the bovine species. The rulers of the land ç
needed horses and elephants for their armed forces. Hence these three ç
animals attracted great attention of the society and a veterinary ç
science centred round them developed in course of time. They are: ç
Gav<193>yurveda (<193>yurveda pertaining to the cows or bovine species ç
of animals), A·v<193>yurveda (<193>yurveda pertaining to the horses) ç
and Hasty<193>yurveda (<193>yurveda pertaining to the elephants).
The Gav<193>yurveda attributed to the sage Gotama, was the standard ç
work current until the middle ages. Apart from diseases and their ç
treatment, the text contained information about diet, breeding, calving, ç
lactation and milk.
The principal work on A·v<193>yurveda is the <185><193>lihotra-sa<221>hit<193> ç
of uncertain date.Extracts from itare found in the Agnipur<193><207>a. ç
The <185><193>lihotra-samuccaya of Kalha<207>a (12th century <MS>A.D.<D>) ç
is believed tobe a redaction of the Sa<221>hit<193>. It is avoluminous ç
work throwing light on different aspects of the horse like anatomy, ç
physiology  and  pathological  conditions requiring medical and surgical ç
treatment. It also contains information relating to breed, sex, age ç
and so on.
The P<193>l<193>kapya-sa<221>hit<193> attributed to the sage P<193>l<193>kapya, ç
is an exhaustive treatise on Hasty<193>yurveda. It is a workin the ç
form of questions and answers between the sage and his disciple Romap<193>da. ç
It deals with anatomy, physiology, pathology, major and minor diseases ç
with medical and surgical treatments, drugs and diet. Another work ç
on the same subject is the M<193>ta<209>gal<200>l<193> of N<200>laka<207><219>h<193>c<193>rya. ç
The dates of both these works are not known.
It may be of interest to mention here, though in passing, that there ç
was a regular veterinary hospital in the campus of the N<193>land<193> ç
university.
@S10 = Zoology
Zoology in ancient India was confined to a very general classification ç
of animals as gleaned from Vedic literature.
The Sa<221>hit<193>s of Caraka and Su·ruta give some information ç
about carnivorous and non-carnivorous land quadrupeds and birds such ç
as lions, tigers, bears, camels, elephants, dogs, wolves, asses, vultures, ç
ospreys, hawks and so on. The other animals mentioned are: frogs, ç
lizards, various kinds of reptiles, water birds like swans, ducks, ç
cranes, flamingos and pelicans, other birds such as pigeons and kingfishers, ç
as also different kinds of insects.
The Artha·<193>stra of Kau<219>ilya (300 <MS>B.C.<D>) has several ç
references to fish and fisheries, to rearing of animals such as cows, ç
buffaloes,  goat,  sheep,  horses  and elephants.
If the Garu<195>apur<193><207>a (<MS>A.D.<D> 900) treats of certain ç
diseases of animals, particularly of horses and elephants, the Nibandha-sa<209>graha ç
of £alla<207>a (10th century <MS>A.D.<D>) gives a detailed and astonishingly ç
precise description of several animals, birds and insects.
Being in constant communion with nature, the Hindus of ancient and ç
medieval India had keenly observed the flora and the fauna around ç
them. The literature that has come down to us in this regard is definitely ç
useful.

10.	Hindu Fine Arts and Music
@S10 = Introduction
The goddess Sarasvat<200> of the Hindu pantheon†the goddess of learning ç
and wisdom†is generally pictured as having four arms. With one, she ç
is holding a book. With two, she is playing on a v<200><207><193> ç
(lute). With the last she is holding the ak<218>am<193>l<193> (rosary).
This representation of her form, has a great symbolical significance. ç
The book stands for all secular knowledge, the lute for fine arts ç
and the rosary for spiritual wisdom. Secular knowledge helps a human ç
being to earn his livelihood. Fine arts enrich his life, giving aesthetic ç
pleasure and emotional satisfaction. Spiritual wisdom fulfils the ç
ultimate purpose of life.
By thus depicting the goddess of learning and wisdom, Hinduism has ç
elevated all fields of knowledge to divine levels.
For a Hindu, his art has originated from God himself. And, his art ç
is also the best means of worshipping God!
Hindu art has several facets: drawing and painting; sculpture; dance ç
and drama; music.
Actually these arts are sometimes enumerated as 64! Some of them, ç
for instance, are: floral designs, preparing various kinds of beds, ç
magic, culinary arts, reading from books, carpentry, goat-fighting, ç
composing poems, physical exercises, hair dressing and so on.
But, the five streams mentioned above are highly developed and hence ç
deserve a more detailed treatment.

@S10 = Drawing and Painting
@SPACE1 = 
@SPACE1 = 
Hindu tradition always attributes a divine origin to all the sciences ç
and arts. The original propagators may be gods like the four-faced ç
Brahm<193> or sages like Bharata. Citrakal<193> or drawing and painting, ç
is said to have originated from the sage N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, the ç
eternal companion of the sage Nara. He is said to have created <188>rva·<200>, ç
the best of heavenly nymphs, by drawing a picture on the urv<200> ç
or earth and then infilling it with life. His work, the Citras<220>tras, ç
which he taught to Vi·vakarma, is not available now.
According to the standard works on this art, a good drawing or painting, ç
must have several features like form, proportion, expression of emotion, ç
grace, and colours. These works are: Ku<219><219>an<200>mata of ç
D<193>modara Gupta, Vi<218><207>udharmottara Pur<193><207>a (<MS>A.D.<D> ç
500), M<193>rka<207><195>eya Pur<193><207>a (<MS>A.D.<D> 300). Abhila<218>it<193>rtha-cint<193>ma<207>i ç
(of Some·vara, <MS>A.D.<D> 1129) and <185>ilparatna.
There are four stages involved in the preparation of a painting: a) ç
preparing the basic surface like a white cloth; b) making it stiff ç
by smearing with a paste of rice or similar material; c) drawing the ç
outlines with charcoal or a black pencil; d) finishing with appropriate ç
colours.
Several varieties of drawing and painting are described in these works. ç
Though paintings can be prepared depicting all the nine sentiments ç
(navarasas*) one can keep in one's home only those that depict humour, ç
amour and peace and not the others. However, in public places, pictures ç
depicting all the nine can be exhibited.
These works also give detailed instructions regarding painting, whether ç
they are objects of nature like uneven surfaces of earth, waves of ç
ocean, fire, smoke and clouds or living beings including every limb ç
of the human beings.
Let us now turn our attention to the ancient pictures and paintings ç
discovered till now in various parts of India.
The oldest pictures so far discovered are located in the caves of ç
Kaimur andVindhya hills as also Raigarh and Mirzapur, all in Madhya ç
Pradesh. They belong to the prehistoric age and were drawn using crude ç
implements of stone. They mostly depict hunting scenes.
The paintings in the Jogimara caves of the Ramgadh hills (Surguja ç
district, Madhya Pradesh) (200 <MS>B.C.<D>) and the ones at Ajant<193> ç
(Maharashtra) (100 <MS>B.C.<D>) are the earliest ones discovered so ç
far.
The Ajant<193> paintings are the creation of expert artists and must ç
have been done during the period 100 <MS>B.C.<D> to <MS>A.D.<D> 700. ç
Their influence seems to have spread to other parts of Asia like Tibet, ç
Afghanistan, China, Korea and even Japan. These paintings are outstanding ç
due to their perfection in the shape of the lines, proportion and ç
combination of colours, variety  and  expression  of  emotions. Various ç
aspects of nature like trees, flowers, animals, human beings including ç
kings and queens, gods of the heavenly regions, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas ç
are the themes of these paintings.
Another variety of paintings has been discovered in the B<193>gh Caves ç
(Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh) and they too resemble the Ajant<193> paintings. ç
The other well-known art-works are: in the B<193>d<193>mi caves of ç
Karnataka (<MS>A.D.<D> 700); in Sittaniv<193>sal of Puduko<219>e (Tamil ç
Nadu; <MS>A.D.<D> 750); in Ellora (Kail<193>sa Temple; <MS>A.D.<D> ç
800) of Maharashtra; in the B<216>had<200>·vara temple of Tanjavur ç
(<MS>A.D.<D> 1100); in some of the temples of Kerala belonging to ç
the erstwhile States of Travancore and Cochin (<MS>A.D.<D> 1100-1700).
The period <MS>A.D.<D> 800 to 1200 seems to have been a dark one since ç
no paintings of  significance  have  been  unearthed. Historians feel ç
that the Muslim invaders of this period might have destroyed such ç
paintings.
The next phase of development in the Hindu art is the evolution of ç
the Rajasthan school, known as R<193>japutra or Rajput style of art. ç
This school of art has earned for itself a unique place in thepanorama ç
of Hindu culture. It has successfully achieved a balanced combination ç
of the secular and the sacred side of life. Jaipur was the nerve-centre ç
of this art. The period of development was from the 15th to the 18th ç
centuries.
While depicting the various aspects of human emotions, due place has ç
been given to natural sense-attractions as also to the struggle against ç
them to achieve self control. Scenes from the epics†the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
and the Mah<193>bh<193>rata†various incidents culled from the R<193>dh<193>-K<216><218><207>a ç
episodes, traditions of the worshippers of K<216><218><207>a as also ç
of <185>iva, form the basic themes of these paintings.
Another speciality of this school is the pictorial representation ç
of the various tunes of Hindu music†the R<193>gas and the R<193>gi<207><200>s†basing ç
them probably on the description of these tunes as given in the standard ç
works on music.
The Rajput art gradually extended to Punjab and some sub-Himalayan ç
regions like N<220>rpur, Camb<193>, Jammu and K<193><209>gra. It gradually ç
acquired a new name†the Pah<193><195><200> school. It reached the ç
summit of its glory during the reign of the K<193><219>och rulers ç
(15th to 17th centuries).
@S10 = Sculpture
Allied with the art of drawing and painting is that of sculpturing. ç
Since there are references to the images of gods in all the four Vedas, ç
it can safely be concluded that the art of sculpturing was current ç
even around 3000 <MS>B.C.<D> The Baudh<193>yana G<216>hyas<220>tras ç
(600 <MS>B.C.<D>) clearly mentions not only about the images of Vi<218><207>u, ç
Ga<207>e·a and Yama, but also gives the details regarding their establishment ç
and worship. Bronze images have been unearthed at the Harappan site ç
of excavation (3000 <MS>B.C.<D>).
During the Vedic age, images were being fashioned out of wood, stone, ç
metal, clay and precious stones.
Images for private worship at home and temples for public worship ç
had already made their appearance even during the Mauryan period (300 ç
<MS>B.C.<D>)
With the growth of images, m<220>rti·ilpa or sculpturing, developed ç
into a regular science. Some of the standard treatises onthis are: ç
<185>ukran<200>tis<193>ra, Mayamata, M<193>nas<193>ra,  B<216>hatsa<221>hit<193>, ç
 <185>ilparatna, <185>ilpas<193>ra, Suprabhed<193>gama and K<193>ra<207><193>-gama.
They give all the relevant details needed in the process of preparing ç
the images.
Images of gods and goddesses are broadly dividedinto two groups: ç
<185>aiva and Vai<218><207>ava. Each of these, again, can be subdivided ç
into three groups: 1)calaprati-m<193>s or movable images; 2) acalapratim<193>s ç
or immovable images; 3) cal<193>calapratim<193>s or movable and fixed ç
images.
The calapratim<193>s are made of metal and are used during utsavas ç
(festivals). They  are  hence  called  `utsavam<220>rtis' (processional ç
images). The acalapratim<193>s also called `dhruvaberas' or `m<220>lavigrahas' ç
†are generally prepared out of stone and fixed to the ground in temples. ç
If the same image is kept in the temple for worship and also taken ç
out in procession it is called `cal<193>cala'. The wooden images in ç
the Jagann<193>tha temple at Pur<200> (in Orissa) belong to this category.
The images may also be in three postures:  sth<193>naka  (standing),  <193>sana ç
(sitting) and ·ay<193>na (reclining or resting). Only the images of ç
Vi<218><207>u are shown in the third posture.
Images may also be ugra (terrible) and ·<193>nta (benign).
The particular aspects of the deities represented by the images can ç
be recognized by observing the mudr<193> (position of the hand and ç
the fingers), <193>sana (posture of legs and feet), cihna (symbol), ç
vasana (dress) and <193>bhara<207>a (ornaments). Among the mudr<193>s ç
and <193>sanas, abhayamudr<193> (assuring protection) and varadamudr<193> ç
(granting boons), padm<193>sana (lotus posture) and yog<193>sana (meditation ç
posture) are most common. <185>aiva and <185><193>kta images (images ç
of <185>iva and Dev<200>) have <195>amaru (drum), tri·<220>la (trident), ç
p<193>·a (noose), a<209>ku·a (goad), b<193><207>a (arrow), kha<195>ga ç
(sword) and so on, as their symbols. Cakra (discus), ·a<209>kha (conch), ç
gad<193> (mace) and padma (lotus) are most common forVai<218><207>ava ç
(Vi<218><207>u and related deities) images.
There are elaborate rules guiding the sculpturing of images. The height ç
or the length, width, girth as also the proportion of the various ç
limbs†each one of these is fixed according to the t<193>lam<193>na ç
system. A `t<193>la' is the measurement of the palm of the hand (from ç
the tip of the middle finger to the wrist) and is equal to the length ç
of the face. The navat<193>la system wherein the total length or height ç
of the image is nine times (nava = nine) the length of the face, is ç
recommended for the images of gods.
In course of time, four distinct styles of sculpturing evolved. They ç
are: the Madurai style; the K<193><210>c<200> style; the C<193>lukya-Hoysa<202>a ç
style; the Bengali style (current in Bengal, Assam and Orissa).
Though all of them follow the general rules of iconography as given ç
in the standard works, they also exhibit their special features.
@S10 = Music
If drawing and painting can strike the eyes, music has the power to ç
rouse the heart. It has the potential to express the moral and spiritual ç
sentiments to the highest degree. It is not only the medicine that ç
can cure an aching heart but also help a spiritual aspirant to raise ç
his soul to God. That is why the Hindu sages have sometimes christened ç
it as `n<193>dayoga' and God as `N<193>dabrahma'. And, music has almost ç
always allied itself with religion and spiritual values.
The three basic notes of Vedic chanting†ud<193>tta, anud<193>tta and ç
svarita† are the fundamental notes of Indian music. These three notes ç
developed later into seven in the S<193>maveda. They are: kru<218><219>a, ç
prathama,  dvit<200>ya,  t<216>t<200>ya,  caturtha, mandra and atisv<193>ra. ç
They correspond to the notes pa<210>cama (pa), madhyama (ma), g<193>ndh<193>ra ç
(ga), <216><218>abha (ri), <218>a<195>ja (sa), daivata (da) and ni<218><193>da ç
(ni), in modern Indian music. Hence, the S<193>maveda has been considered ç
to be the origin of Indian music.
During the earliest period, sa<209>g<200>ta or music was considered ç
to be an integral part of n<216>tya or n<193><219>ya or dancing. Dancing, ç
music and drama (n<193><219>aka) were treated as one unit†N<193><219>ya·<193>stra ç
or the science of dramaturgy. And, Bharata's N<193><219>ya-·<193>stra ç
(<MS>A.D.<D> 100) is considered to be the original systematic treatise ç
on this subject. The other standard works often referred to are:

                 	Todaramalla <MS>(A.D.<D> 1600)
In Indian music the two invariable basic notes are sa and pa. The ç
others†ri, ga, ma, da and ni†are of two varieties each, making a total ç
of 12 notes. Sometimes 16 notes are described, though, for all practical ç
purposes 12 are enough.
A permutation and combination of these notes produce a variety of ç
r<193>gas or tunes. Those tunes in which all the seven notes are present ç
are called `melakart<193>' or `janaka' r<193>gas. The derivatives ç
are known as `janya' r<193>gas.
Ve<209>ka<219>amakhi (<MS>A.D.<D> 1600) in his magnum opus, the ç
Caturda<207><195>iprak<193>·ik<193> (written in Sanskrit verses) ç
has grouped the 72 janaka-r<193>gas into two groups of 36 each. He ç
has also dealt with many other fundamental aspects of music in this ç
great work which has remained as an invaluable guide to all musicians.
As far as the janya or the derived r<193>gas are concerned, they can ç
be limitless. Even now, talented musicians are inventing new r<193>gas.
The various r<193>gas or tunes are capable of expressing a variety ç
of feelings and sentiments such as love, anger, tenderness, sorrow, ç
disappointment, pity, joy and so on.
Another speciality of Indian music is that specific r<193>gas are ç
assigned to specific periods of the day or night. If certain r<193>gas ç
like M<193>y<193>m<193><202>ava-gau<202>a (or Bhairav) are to be sung ç
early in the morning, Kaly<193><207><200> (or Yaman) is to be sung ç
in the night. The very atmosphere at that time is said to enhance ç
its power to rouse the particular sentiment to which it is tuned.
If symphony is the heart of Western music, ·ruti (drone or basic musical ç
sound as the one produced by the t<193>np<220>ra), r<193>ga (tune), ç
t<193>la (fixed number of beats for each unit) and laya (uniform speed ç
for the beats) are the basics for Indian music. Thirty-five varieties ç
of t<193>las have been evolved.
Though Indian music had been one for several centuries, due to the ç
Persian influence  exerted  during  the  Mughal period, there was ç
a gradual branching into two schools: the uttar<193>di or the North ç
Indian and the dak<218>i<207><193>di or the South Indian (also called ç
Carn<193><219>ic). There are many similarities as also notable distinctions  between  the  two  schools.  The ç
uttar<193>di school further got subdivided into ghar<193><207><193>s ç
or traditions which are alive and active even today.
A music performance is generally centred round the vocalist. In the ç
South Indian classical music the vocalist is accompanied by the violinist ç
and another who plays on the m<216>da<209>gam (a percussion instrument). ç
Of course, the t<193>np<220>ra should always be there as the basic ç
instrument. Sometimes other percussion instruments like gha<219>am ç
(a mud pot), kha<210>j<200>ra (a disc-like percussion instrument) ç
and morsing (a small stringed instrument played by mouth) are also ç
added.
In the North Indian classical music performances, the vocalist is ç
generally accompanied by the harmonium and thetabal<193> (a percussion ç
instrument in twopieces) players. Occasionally stringed instruments ç
(similar to the violin) like the s<193>ra<209>g<200> or the dilr<220>b<193> ç
are also used. T<193>np<220>ra is, however, a must.
Apart from vocal music, Indian music system is rich in instruments ç
too. Even in the Vedic and allied literature there are references ç
to v<200><207><193> (lute), v<193><207>a (an instrument with 100 strings), ç
dhanurv<200><207><193>, dundubhi (drum), <193><195>ambara and so on. ç
The dhanurv<200><207><193> is said to be the precursor of the violin ç
now imported from the West. Many other instruments like b<193>nsur<200>, ç
flute, sit<193>r, sarod, go<219>uv<193>dyam, pakhv<193>j, khol, clarionet, ç
n<193>dasvaram and shehanai have also come into use over the years.
@S10 = Dance
Dance, like music, has always been a means by which human beings have ç
tried to express their inner feelings. For instance, the rustic villagers ç
express their gratitude to the deities of nature even now, through ç
their folk-dances during the harvest season. In most of the societies ç
there are dances for every important social occasion.
Indian dance is said to have originated from <185>iva and P<193>rvat<200>, ç
the divine couple, the parents of the world. Gods like Ga<207>apati ç
and K<216><218><207>a, minor deities like Nandi and Bh<216><209>gi, ç
goddess Sarasvat<200>†all of them are fond of dancing.
The Sa<209>g<200>taratn<193>kara of <185><193>r<209>gadeva (<MS>A.D.<D> ç
1260) calls the art of dancing as N<193><219>yaveda and declares ç
that the four faced Brahm<193>, the creator, taught it to Bharata ç
who exhibited it before <185>iva himself in Kail<193>sa. Then <185>iva, ç
who had taught the t<193><207><195>ava dance to the sage Ta<207><195>u, ç
asked him to teach that also to Bharata. Then P<193>rvat<200>, <185>iva's ç
spouse, taught the l<193>sya dance (specially suited to women) to ç
U<218><193>, the daughter of B<193><207>a. This is how the science ç
and art of dancing was spread in this world.
Vedas refer to dancing as also to several musical instruments. Figurines ç
in the dancing pose have been found in the Indus valley excavations ç
(3000 <MS>B.C.<D>). The two epics also speak of dancing as a flourishing ç
art.
Encouragement given to dancing right from the times of the Mauryan ç
emperors helped it to grow to phenomenal proportions. The devad<193>s<200> ç
custom, whatever might have been its evil effects, also helped in ç
the development of the dancing arts.

The standard works dealing with the art of dancing are:

Both the authors seem to be legendary figures. The extant N<193><219>ya·<193>stra ç
maynot be the original. A commentary Abhinayabh<193>rat<200> on ç
it by Abhinavagupta has been discovered, but only in fragments.
Outward expression of inner emotions is the heart of the dancing art. ç
It is done by abhinaya or rhythmic movements of limbs, various types ç
of stances and mudr<193>s or poses of hands. Dresses suitable to theoccasion ç
and music with all the accompaniments enhance the total effect. The ç
themes are generally chosen from the epics and the pur<193><207>as.

preserved over the centuries. After the fall of the Vijayanagar empire, ç
the artists of this school migrated toTa<210>j<193>v<220>r (Tanjore) ç
and developed it further.
The word `bharata' is sometimes treated as an abbreviation of bha ç
(= bh<193>va, abstract idea), ra (= rasa, emotion) and ta (= t<193>la, ç
musical time or measure).
It has branched off into three traditions: the Sadir-n<193><219>ya, ç
the Bh<193>gavatame<202><193> and Kuruva<210>ji.
The Sadir-n<193><219>ya was generally done by the devad<193>s<200>s ç
(temple dancers) to the background of Carn<193><219>ic music, comprising ç
amorous songs with a greater stress on foot-work, Sanskrit hymns and ç
songs depicting scenes from K<216><218><207>a's life to embellish ç
the acting part and conclusion with till<193>nas (musical compositions ç
with words imitating the sounds of percussion instruments).
The Bh<193>gavata-me<202><193>s are actually dance dramas with religious ç
themes and are enacted in temples.
In the Kuruva<210>ji, the dancer represents the individual soul in ç
search of the divine who is the deity of the temple. This is always ç
a religious dance performed in temples.
@S8ITAL = KATHAK
The Kathak dance tradition had its origin in the devotional dances ç
current in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Devotees of K<216><218><207>a ç
used to dance, to the accompaniment of bhajans (devotional songs), ç
trying to express the sentiments contained therein. The themes were ç
also connected with K<216><218><207>a.
The Kathak branched off into two traditions: the Jaipur (Rajasthan) ç
and theLucknow (Uttar Pradesh) traditions. Subtlety and speed are ç
the characteristics of the former while the latter is marked by acting ç
and grace.
@S8ITAL = KATHAKKA<170>®
This is a speciality of the Kerala State and Malay<193><202>am culture. ç
It seems to have originated from folk-dances with paur<193><207>ic ç
themes.
It has three varieties: K<220>ttu, R<193>man<193><219><219>am and ç
K<216><218><207>an<193><219><219>am.
The K<220>ttu dance was the privileged possession of the C<193>ky<193>r ç
community of Kerala. It used to be exhibited in temples during festival ç
days, the themes being chosen from paur<193><207>ic legends or even ç
famous incidents culled from history.
The other two are identical in form and pattern except that the former ç
has R<193>ma episodes and the latter K<216><218><207>a episodes for ç
their themes.
In the Kathakka<202><200>, the dancers do not speak or sing but express ç
all the sentiments through acting. The themes are invariably from ç
Hindu mythology. Colours of the dress and ornaments are apportioned ç
as per the nature of the character, viz., whether it is s<193>ttvik, ç
r<193>jasik or t<193>masik.
The Kathakka<202><200> dances are usually held in the open fields ç
and that too in moonlight.
Announcing about the Kathakka<202><200> programme, invocatory verses ç
from behind the screens, beating of drums, entry of the first dancer, ç
narration of the story from the background, dance and acting by the ç
persons playing the various roles, theirconversations being recited ç
in the background†these are the various aspects of the programme.
@S8ITAL = K<188>CIPU£®
This is a typical dance of Andhra Pradesh. It got prominence during ç
thedays when the Vijayanagar Empire flourished.
It is known for its s<193>ttvik sentiments and acting.
The themes selected are mostly from the 17th century works†the Brahma- ç
kalpam and P<193>rij<193>tam of Siddh<193>ndhra Yogi†and others ç
such as Gollakalpam, containing Ved<193>ntic conversations between ç
a cowherdess and a br<193>hma<207>a.
Da·<193>vat<193>ras are another popular theme.
@S8ITAL = MAØIPUR®
The promoters of the Ma<207>ipur<200> dance claim that the tradition ç
was started by <185>iva himself, at the suggestion of his spouse P<193>rvat<200>. ç
Citr<193><209>gad<193> of Mah<193>-bh<193>rata fame whom the P<193><207><195>ava ç
hero Arjuna married, was a princess of the Ma<207>ipur<200> royal ç
family and was an accomplished dancer.
Originally,  the  Ma<207>ipur<200>  dances centred round the <185>iva-P<193>rvat<200> ç
themes. However, as Vai<218><207>avism spread in that area, K<216><218><207>a ç
became the hero and central figure.
Bh<193>gyacandra, the king of Ma<207>ipur (18th century) introduced ç
the R<193>sal<200>l<193> dance after building a temple for K<216><218><207>a ç
(called Govinda-sv<193>min). In course of time,six modes of dancing, ç
suitable for six <216>tus or seasons,evolved. They are: Vasantar<193>sa,   Ku<210>jar<193>sa,   Kart<193>r<193>sa, ç
Nartar<193>sa, Div<193>r<193>sa and Mah<193>r<193>sa.
Another style called L<193>y-haraub<193> is also current. This is ç
deemed to be very ancient and considered as the original ofthe Ma<207>ipur<200> ç
dances. It includes enactment of the various stages of creation by ç
God and is generally spread over a month.
R<193>sal<200>l<193>, the dance of K<216><218><207>a with the gop<200>s ç
of V<216>nd<193>vana, is another aspect of the Ma<207>ipur<200> school. ç
It also depicts the various incidents from the life of K<216><218><207>a ç
and hence the performance is spread over the whole night.
@S8ITAL = O£ISSI-N°<187>YA
It is an ancient tradition of dancing based on Bharata's N<193><219>ya·<193>stra. ç
Being influenced by the Oriya style of music, it developed its own ç
characteristic features. It was actually a dance by the devad<193>s<200>s ç
before the Lord Jagann<193>tha in the famous temple at Pur<200>, generally ç
assigned to the 12th century <MS>A.D.<D> By the 14th century, the ç
tradition of `nartaka-b<193>lakas' (boy-dancers) was also developed.
The O<195>issi tradition of dancing as resurrected now, has integrated ç
into itself both the North Indian and the South Indian styles. The ç
background music is mainly North Indian. Some characteristic features ç
of Bharatan<193><219>ya, Kathakka<202><200> and Kathak are also found ç
in it. Story of K<216><218><207>a and themes as found in Jayadeva's ç
(<MS>A.D.<D> 1200) A<218><219>apad<200> are the backbone of the ç
present-day O<195>issi dances.
@S8ITAL = SATTRIYA-N°<187>YA
<185>a<209>kara Deva (<MS>A.D.<D> 1486-1568), thegreat Vai<218><207>ava ç
teacher of Assam, established a number of Vai<218><207>ava Ma<219>has ç
(centres of a religious denomination or cult) to propagate his cult. ç
These Ma<219>has in course of time started `sattras,' centres of religious ç
instructions. These sattras introduced  devotional  dances  called ç
`Sattriya-n<193><219>ya' which have protected their religious and ç
devotional tradition.
These dances have two branches: Jumur·<193>li  and  R<193>s.  The  former  is ç
connected with K<216><218><207>a's life and the latter with the R<193>sal<200>l<193> ç
or K<216><218><207>a's dance with the gop<200>s.
The Jumur·<193>li dance is a kind of religious exercise specially ç
practised and enacted by young men of the sattras who have dedicated ç
their lives for this purpose. The old teachers who train them support ç
the dance with background music.
@S8ITAL = YAK<186>AG°NA
Prevalent in parts of Karnataka, the Yak<218>ag<193>na (also called ç
Bayal<193><219>a) is a dance-drama and is similar in form to the Kathakka<202><200> ç
of the Kerala State. Though based on the techniques given in Bharata's ç
N<193><219>ya·<193>stra it has attained a strong local colour. The ç
artists not only dance but also sing and talk according to the roles ç
they have to play. The themes are invariably taken from the epics ç
and the pur<193><207>as.
@S8ITAL = FOLK-DANCES
Whatever has been described so far, applies to the refined and cultured ç
systems of dancing developed as an art. However there are several ç
varieties of folk-dances spread all over the country which have become ç
an inalienable part of the daily life of the masses. On all joyous ç
occasions of life like marriage, birth in a family, festivals and ç
sacred days, good harvest and so on, the common people†men and women, ç
young and old†dance in their own way. However, over the centuries, ç
these dances too have assumed some set patterns. Some of them may ç
be mentioned here:

There is no gainsaying the fact that dances have not only enriched ç
our national culture but have also added a new dimension of joy and ç
pleasure to the life of our masses.
@S10 = Drama
@SPACE = 
According to the N<193><219>ya·<193>stra ofBharata, music and dancing ç
are an integral†but subsidiary†part of n<193><219>aka or drama. However, ç
both of them gradually developed into independent streams of art. ç
Drama, on the other hand, continued to retain them also as its parts.
@SPACE1 = 
Drama, as an item of social education and entertainment, must have ç
originated at a very early period. The <184>gvedic mantras wherein ç
a <216><218>i, under the exciting influence of soma juice, challenges ç
Indra to fight with him, or, another one pathetically describes his ç
fate brought about by his weakness for gambling, point to the histrionic ç
talents inherent in many human beings.
@SPACE1 = 
The basic theme of a drama is expressed  through  conversations  and ç
music with appropriate acting. The total effect will be enhanced by ç
proper dress, ornaments and equipment. All these are dealt with in ç
the N<193><219>ya·<193>stra of Bharata.
@SPACE1 = 
For the enactment of a drama, a suitable place, called `ra<209>gasthala,' ç
was necessary. It could be triangular, square, circular or semicircular ç
in shape depending on the availability of space. It was generally ç
divided into two parts: the ra<209>gabh<220>mi (stage) and the prek<218><193>g<216>ha ç
(auditorium). During the earlier period, these two parts used to be ç
of equal dimensions.
@SPACE1 = 
The stage had a green-room, a back stage and a front stage as also ç
a rest room at the side. Screens were very much in use.
@SPACE1 = 
Dresses and ornament as also different hair-styles appropriate for ç
the roles played have been described in detail in the works of n<193><219>ya·<193>stra. ç
Masks also were in use.
The themes of the dramas in ancient days might have been chosen from ç
the mythological literature. With the advent of classical Sanskrit ç
literature, social themes too might have become popular as evidenced ç
by the dramas of K<193>lid<193>sa, Bhavabh<220>ti (8th cent.), <185><220>draka ç
(3rd cent.) and others.
There is reason to believe that the dramatic art might have branched ç
off into two streams†the refined type for kings, courtiers and the ç
elite of the society; the folk-type meant for the masses.
It  may  safely  be  assumed  that dramatics was a well-developed ç
art in India even during the beginning of the christian era.

11.	Hindu Culture Outside India
@S10 = Introduction
The desire for conquest is inherent in human beings. Conquest, however, ç
can be of two types: physical conquest through war and violence; cultural ç
conquest through the head and the heart. Histories of nations over ç
the centuries have proved that it is the latter that survives whereas ç
even the traces of the former may be thrown out when the conquered ç
nation rebels and reasserts itself, regaining its lost freedom.
The cultural conquest has another, a tremendous, advantage. The heart ç
can mellow the head when the latter displays arrogance. And, the head ç
can harden theformer if it leads to debilitating sentimentalism.
The way Hindu culture, based on the multifaceted Hindu religion, has ç
quietly spread far beyond the geographical boundaries of India, proves ç
this theory. It is the sages and savants, sans the Sword and sans ç
the Book, that went out of this country to other regions of the globe ç
to spread the message of universal love and brotherhood. They were ç
least interested in political colonization or accumulating wealth ç
through trade and commerce. India had plenty of military power and ç
wealth. In fact it is the latter that tempted the foreigners from ç
the Middle-East and the West to set off a series of savage invasions ç
against this country. That neither the Hindus nor their religion and ç
culture were wiped out of this land†on the other hand, they are still ç
going strong†is proof enough of the wonderful religio-cultural resilience ç
of the Hindus.
Right from the beginning of the Christian era, if not earlier, Hindu ç
religion and culture have spread to all parts of Asia, and some parts ç
of the Middle-East as also Siberia and the Americas. It will be interesting ç
to study this phenomenon to enrich our own knowledge of the same.
For the sake of easy comprehension the presentation can be made according ç
to the countries, arranged in the alphabetical order.
@S10 = Afghanisthan
The G<193>ndh<193>ra De·a of the epic period has been identified with ç
the present-day Afghanisthan. The name of the Kandahar city seems ç
to confirm this.
Two images of Ga<207>e·a have been found in this country:
1.
@NK = One at Gardez (belonging to the 6th century <MS>A.D.<D>);
2.
@NK = Another at Sakar Dhar near Kabul (belonging to the 4th century ç
<MS>A.D.<D>). Here, images of S<220>rya and <185>iva (7th century ç
<MS>A.D.<D>) also have been discovered.
The colossal image of Buddha near Bamiyan, measuring 53 meters (177 ç
ft.) is another standing monument of Indian culture.1
@S10 = America
Christopher Columbus (<MS>A.D.<D> 1451-1506) is said to have discovered ç
America. But, did he, really? May be, but only for Europe! He discovered ç
a few small islands between the two huge American continents and a ç
small part of the Honduran coast!
But, millennia before that, the Americas had not only been discovered ç
but had also been covered with large settlements of Indian (Hindu) ç
population. The Aztecs of Central Mexico, the Incas of Peru and Mayas ç
of Yucatan (South-East Mexico) were all Hindu settlers from India.2 ç
They believed in the four Yugas, had adopted the gurukula system of ç
education, the pa<210>c<193>yat system of village administration and ç
the bazaar economy, performed Soma sacrifices, worshipped Indra, Ga<207>e·a ç
and other Hindu deities, were well-versed in Hindu religious dances, ç
practised the rituals usually associated with child-birth, marriage ç
and death, and had the priestly hierarchy too.
@S10 = Arabia
Hewitt, in his monumental work Ruling Races of Prehistoric Times1 ç
(Vol.II), gives an elaborate account of Hindu rule in Arabia and ç
Mesapotamia.
Will Durant, in his well-known book, The Story of Civilization ç
(Vol. IV, The Age of Faith, New York, Simon and Schuster, pp. 161-171) ç
writes that within the Kaaba, in the pre-Moslem days, there were several ç
idols and that one was called `Allah,' which was probably the tribal ç
god of the Quraish. Three other female images were probably Allah's ç
daughters. Prof. Shustery confirms this, adding however, that there ç
were 360images of the gods!<|>2
During the festival and pilgrimage seasons, `kany<193>s' or unmarried ç
girls, took part in dancing.
Even now, the Haj pilgrims are expected to wear two unstitched cloths3, ç
similar to dhoti and uttar<200>ya (or a<209>ga- vastra).
It is now a well-recognized fact that the Arabs were responsible in ç
propagating in Europe, the literature and knowledge they had acquired ç
from India, like thePa<210>catantra and several treatises on subjects ç
such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine and surgery and so on.
@S10 = Bali and J<193>va
Hindu religion and culture started spreading to the various islands ç
of South East Asia even from the first century <MS>A.D.<D> Some of ç
the kings of South India who were defeated by their rivals, migrated ç
to the islands like J<193>va and established their own kingdoms there.
Known as Yavadv<200>pa, probably from the 10th cent. <MS>A.D.,<D> ç
J<193>va was the home ofwell-known dynasties of kings like <185>r<200>vijaya ç
R<193>ja.
The work Aji·aka states that during the first century <MS>A.D.,<D> ç
twenty thousand people from Kali<209>ga (Orissa, India) came and settled ç
down in the island of J<193>va.
A very large number of Hindu scriptural works in Sanskrit (excepting ç
the Vedas) written in the Kawi script have been discovered. The following ç

Apart from these there is the famous R<193>m<193>ya<207>a Kakawin ç

<185>aivism made its first appearance in J<193>va around 4th century ç
<MS>A.D.<D> The oldest image of Ga<207>e·a has been found on the Dieng ç

The residents of the island of Bali are all Hindus even today. They ç
follow the var<207>a-<193>·rama system. Upanayana ceremony and sandhy<193> ç
ritual are being observed even now.
Shadow-plays, puppet-shows and Bharatan<193><219>ya with Hindu mythological ç
themes are still in vogue.
@S10 = Borneo (Indonesia)
Around the 5th century <MS>A.D.<D> Hinduism had already penetrated ç
into Borneo. An epigraphical record discovered at Kotei describes ç
the performance of some Hindu rites there. Most of the images discovered ç
in Borneo are either <185>aivite (including a Ga<207>e·a image) or ç
Buddhist. A Sanskrit inscription on a y<220>pastambha (pillar of sacrifice ç
used in Vedic rituals) has also been found and has been attributed ç
to M<220>lavarma (<MS>A.D.<D> 480).
@S10 = Burma (Myanmar)
Even during A·oka's time (272-232 <MS>B.C.<D>) Buddhism had spread ç
to Burma. The first Hindu kingdom had been established in the Arakan ç
province by <MS>A.D.<D> 162. The Vikramar<193>ja dynasty and the Sukhodaya ç
kingdom came into existence in the 8th and the 9th centuries.
King Poonnareeka (Pu<207><195>ar<200>ka?) who ascended the throne ç
of the Pegu dominion in 746 <MS>A.D.<D> was considered as a lover ç
of br<193>hma<207>as. It was he who built the city of Ramanago (City ç
of R<193>ma). The Rangoon City of today stands on the same site.
The people of Pegu were known as the Mons and also as Talai<209>gs, ç
thereby suggesting their migration from the Telengana region of Andhra ç
Pradesh.
With their knowledge of astrology and other sciences, the br<193>hma<207>as ç
among the Talai<209>gs held important positions even in the courts ç
of the Buddhist kings. While performing religious ceremonies on special ç
occasions such as coronation of a king or laying the foundation for ç
a new building, they had introduced the worship of N<193>r<193>ya<207>a.
There are good reasons to believe inthe existence of a Vi<218><207>u ç
temple at Pagan, from an inscription engraved on sand-stone, containing ç
a Sanskrit verse from the famous Mukundam<193>l<193> Stotra of Kula-·ekhara, ç
but in the Grantha script.
The Burmese law-books, called Dhammathats, are based on the Manu-sm<216>ti. ç
They are still recognised as valid legal authority regulating inheritance ç
and other domestic disputes.
@S10 = Cambodia (Kampuchia)
Known as Kambuja-de·a in our paur<193><207>ic literature, the first ç
kingdom of Cambodia is said to have been established by one Kau<207><195>inya, ç
a disciple of A·vatth<193>ma. He married a N<193>ga princess, Som<193> ç
by name, built a capital Bhavapura and started the Somava<221>·a line ç
of Hindu rulers there.
The great sage Agastya from South India, is reputed to have spread ç
the Hindu religion and culture in the entire South East Asia and is ç
highly revered in Cambodia even now.
Numerous inscriptions†most of them in faultless Sanskrit†have been ç
found in Cambodia, confirming the spread of Hindu religion and culture.
Both the Bh<193>gavata (Vai<218><207>ava) and the <185>aiva cults ç
were popular. Temples of <185>iva and Ga<207>apati exist even now. ç
There was very good understanding between the Buddhists and the Hindus. ç
Even by the 6th century <MS>A.D.<D>, study of the Vedas, recitation ç
of R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, Mah<193>bh<193>rata and some pur<193><207>as, ç
was quite common. Tantras like Jayadrathay<193>mala and Ni··v<193>sa-sa<221>hit<193> ç
were in vogue. Princes of theroyal families were educated in the ç
Sanskrit grammar of P<193><207>ini, Siddh<193>ntas (<185>aiva?), dharma·<193>stras ç
and the dar·anas also, apart from all secular fields of knowledge ç
needed by them.
Among the Hindu temples, the Angkor Vat, near the city of Angkor Thom* ç
(built by the King S<220>ryavarman II, <MS>A.D.<D> 1112-1152) is the ç
most famous.
The Bayon Vat, also in Angkor Thom, is a Buddhist temple of colossal ç
dimensions built by Jayavarman VII (<MS>A.D.<D> 1120-1215). The large ç
towers exhibit gigantic masks of Bodhisattva Loke·vara on the four ç
sides of each and everyone of the towers.
@S10 = Camp<193> (South Annam, part of Vietnam)
Known as Camp<193>de·a in the various Sanskrit inscriptions of that ç
country, it is now a part of Vietnam, its South Annam region. The ç
impact of Hindu culture must have started as early as the 2nd century ç
<MS>A.D.<D> The important centres of the ancient kingdom of Indo-China ç
were: Amar<193>vat<200> (Quangnam), Vijaya (Bin-dinh); Kauthara (Nhatrang); ç
P<193><207><195>ura<209>ga (Phan-rang).

in height and is assigned to the period <MS>A.D.<D> 350.
@SPACE1 = 
The oldest king, according to an inscription   discovered   at   Vo-Canh, ç
belonged to the <185>r<200>m<193>ra dynasty (3rd cent. <MS>A.D.<D>). ç
A new dynasty was established by Rudravarman (<MS>A.D.<D> 530-572) ç
belonging to a `brahma-k<218>attriya' family.
@SPACE1 = 
Another monarch, Bhadravarman by name (early 5th cent. <MS>A.D.<D>), ç
is said to have built a temple for <185>iva (`Bhadre·vara-sv<193>min'<|>) ç
at the site now identified with Mison. The temple site of Mison contains ç
ruins of over seventy small and big buildings constructed from time ç
to time by the kings of Camp<193>.
@SPACE1 = 
P<216>thv<200>ndra Varman (<MS>A.D.<D> 758-773) and Harivarman (<MS>A.D.<D> ç
800-820) were the other kings who were famous for their benign rule.
@SPACE1 = 
A four-armed standing image of Ga<207>e·a has also been discovered ç
in the same site, near a <185>ivali<209>ga. Skanda (Kum<193>ra or ç
Subrahma<207>ya) was also a popular deity, not only with the masses ç
but also with the rulers.
@SPACE1 = 
A number of Hindu temples, belonging mostly to the 10th century <MS>A.D.,<D> ç
are found in the same area. Some of them are still in a good condition.
@S10 = C<200>n<193> (China)
Unlike the influence of Hindu religion and culture on the countries ç
of South East Asia, Indian influence on C<200>n<193> or China has ç
been confined almost entirely to the spread of Buddhism. According ç
to one view, images of Buddha made in India, were found even during ç
the early period of the H<193>n dynasty (121 <MS>B.C.<D>). Buddhism ç
is said to have been introduced into China during the rule of Emperor ç
Ming in <MS>A.D.<D> 67. History of the Liyang dynasty mentions the ç
arrival of ambassadors from India during the years <MS>A.D.<D> 85 ç
to 167.
A galaxy of scholarly Buddhist monks started visiting China right ç
from <MS>A.D.<D> 64. To mention a few: Ka·yapa M<193>ta<209>ga, Dharmaratna, ç
Mah<193>bala and Dharma-phala. They settled in the Lo-yang province ç
and spent most of their time in translating many Buddhist works1 ç
into the Chinese language.
The greatest of such scholars was Kum<193>raj<200>va (<MS>A.D.<D> ç
344-413). He arrived in Chang-an during <MS>A.D.<D> 401 and before ç
his death in 413, had translated several Buddhist works including ç
the more famous ones like the Praj<210><193>p<193>ramit<193>-s<220>tras ç
and Saddharma-pu<207><195>ar<200>ka.
The other Indian scholars who did notable work of translation are: ç
Param<193>rtha (<MS>A.D.<D> 499-569); <185>ubh<193>kara-si<221>ha ç
(<MS>A.D.<D> 637-735); Vajrabodhi (<MS>A.D.<D> 671-741) and Amoghavajra ç
(<MS>A.D.<D> 705-774).
That a large number of Chinese travellers visited India from time ç
to time for higher studies in Buddhism is now a well-recognised fact ç
of history. Among them the following were more well-known for their ç
life and work: Fahien (<MS>A.D.<D> 399-410); Hiuen Tsang (<MS>A.D.<D> ç
600-664); Itsing (<MS>A.D.<D> 635-713).
@EMERGEN1 = It is interesting to note that Ga<207>e·a pictures have ç
been discovered on wooden panels and frescoes in Khotan in West China, ç
suggesting the spread of Hinduism at an early period.
@S10 = Iran (Eastern part)
Iran†known earlier as Persia†was the home of Zoroaster (6th cent. ç
<MS>B.C.<D>) and his religion, Zoroastrianism or the P<193>rsi religion, ç
which has a great affinity to the early Vedic Hinduism.
According to the account of some Chinese   travellers,   the   H<200>nay<193>na ç
Buddhism was prevalent in Persia and that the vessel which Buddha ç
was using to beg his food, had been preserved in the store-house of ç
the king.2
@EMERGEN1 = Al-Beruni (<MS>A.D<D>. 973-1039) has stated that in former ç
times Khorasan, Persia, Iraq, Mosul and the country up to the frontier ç
of Syria were Buddhistic.
@EMERGEN1 = During the 7th century <MS>A.D.,<D> there was a regular ç
exchange of envoys between the King Khusru of Persia and Pulake·in ç
II in South India.
The late king of Iran, the Shah, who was dethroned and forced to leave ç
the country, belonged to a ruling dynasty called `Pahlavas'. The Pahlavas ç
are a race of k<218>attriyas mentioned in Vedic legends.3 It is ç
also interesting to note that his royal title, `°rya-mihir' (`the ç
Sun of the Aryan race') is a pure Sanskrit word!
The well-known story of the descent of the Ga<209>g<193> river from ç
heaven has found an important place in the Zend Avesta, the scripture ç
of Zoroastrianism, in the pre-Islamic Iran.
The Yazidis†also spelt as Yezdis† are a confederation of tribes and ç
have a religion based on Zoroastrianism. Kurdish, Turkish and Arab ç
tribes are included in this group. They have the caste system (4 castes, ç
similar to the 4 var<207>as), practise monogamy, believe in the transmigration ç
of souls and revere fire.1
@S10 = Japan
Buddhism entered Japan via China and Korea. It gradually replaced ç
Shintoism the native religion of Japan.
The word `Zen,' in `Zen-Buddhism,' which became extremely popular ç
in Japan is a corrupt form of the Sanskrit word `dhy<193>na'. Being ç
a combination of Buddhist teachings and Taoist mysticism, it teaches ç
meditation on the <185><220>nya or the Great Void, reminiscent of ç
the Nirgu<207>a Brahman of Advaita Ved<193>nta.
The Buddhist temple complex Hory<220>ji, near Nara (South Honshu, ç
Japan) is the oldest in Japan. It contains mural paintings of Buddhas ç
and lesser figures, all in the Ajant<193> style.
Contacts Japan had with ancient India are also confirmed by the Japanese ç
beliefs and stories such as a hare living on the moon, the story of ç
the crocodile, the monkey and his liver, and, the <184><218>ya·<216><209>ga ç
legend that was developed as an opera, The Story of Monoceros.
Huge  icons  of  Buddha  prepared during the period <MS>A.D.<D> 747 ç
to <MS>A.D.<D> 1252 also bespeak of the spread and popularity of Buddhism.
@S10 = Korea
Korea had contact with India right from the 4th century <MS>A.D.<D> ç
Buddhism was brought to Korea from China by a bhik<218>u, Soondo by ç
name, in <MS>A.D.<D> 372, during the reign of king Sosoorimwang.
The  first  Indian  teacher†whose Korean name was Ahdo2†arrived ç
in <MS>A.D.<D> 374 and two temples were built in <MS>A.D.<D> 375 at ç
Pyongyang. Ten years later, the second Indian teacher, Mall<193>nanda, ç
came to Korea. The third one†Mookhoja by name†is said to have visited ç
Korea during <MS>A.D.<D> 417.
Gradually different sects were established. Both the king and the ç
people started constructing temples and vih<193>ras (Buddhist monasteries) ç
with images and painting of Buddha and other divinities.
The manufacture of sacred utensils used in worship and other works ç
of art contributed to the development of various fine-arts.
In course of time, the Korean scholars introduced not only Buddhism, ç
but also certain arts, crafts and literature into Japan.
Kymik was probably the first priest of Korea to visit India and bring ç
several Buddhist scriptures of the Vinaya school. Six more visited ç
India later.
Kwanrenk of Paikje was an eminent scholar who went to Japan and established ç
the famous Hory<220>ji temples there.
Wunchenk (<MS>A.D.<D> 613-696) of Silla was a great Sanskrit scholar ç
responsible for establishing a special school of Buddhism.
Around the 8th century <MS>A.D.<D> the Dhy<193>na (Zen) cult was introduced ç
into Korea.
Construction of caves and st<220>pas like those in India, some musical ç
instruments in use like the flute and mohtahk (gha<207><219><193> ç
or bell) as also temple bells bespeak of Indian influence on Korean ç
art and architecture.
The Koryuh dynasty (<MS>A.D.<D> 936 to 1391) built and restored temples, ç
st<220>pas and monasteries. The greatest achievement of these kings ç
is the production of the Mah<193>dharmako<218>a (<MS>A.D.<D> 1070), ç
an encyclopaedia of Buddhism, through scholars in their court. When ç
it was destroyed by the invading Mongols, another edition was produced ç
in <MS>A.D.<D> 1236.
@EMERGEN1 = The Hanguel script of Korea was developed, based on the ç
phonetic system of Sanskrit in <MS>A.D.<D> 1443.
@EMERGEN1 = Indian culture has had a great influence on many aspects ç
of Korean culture,  whether  art  or  architecture, literature, music ç
or dance.
@S10 = Laos
Originally known as `Lava,' Laos is one of the countries of South ç
East Asia,deeply influenced by India. As per archaeological  evidence  and  Chinese ç
records, the Hindus colonised and established their kingdoms not only ç
in Burma but also in the upper valleys of Chindwin river (in Burma ç
or Myanmar), the Irawadi and the Salween rivers (also in Burma) as ç
also the Mekong and the Red River areas (in South East Asia). There ç
is evidence that a Hindu kingdom existed in Laos also. The earliest ç
known historical king was <185>rutavarman and then his son <185>re<218><219>havarman.* ç
The capital of the kingdom, the <185>re<218><219>hapura was located ç
around Vat Phu Hill near Bassac (in Laos).
@SPACE1 = 
The earliest material evidence of ancient Hindu influence goes back ç
to the 6th century <MS>A.D.<D> The Vat Phu Hill near Bassac was then ç
called Li<209>gaparvata. Atemple of Bhadre·vara <185>iva is said ç
to have existed there.
@SPACE1 = 
In Laos, there are many figures of Buddha with certain Indian traits ç
like the hair on the head being treated in small curls or the n<193>s<193>grad<216><218><219>i ç
(gaze being fixed on the tip of the nose).
@SPACE1 = 
The scriptural art as also architecture of Laos also shows Indian ç
influence as seen in the Vat Pa Ruok and Vat BanTan temples. They ç
contain Gupta-C<193>lukyan features. The monastery Ban Peng Thai exhibits ç
certain traits prevalent in medieval Kerala. Window frames of big ç
buildings clearly show Hindu influence. The Vat Pra temple (17th cent ç
<MS>A.D.<D>) is adorned by an image of Lak<218>m<200> standing on ç
a lotus, over its dome!
@SPACE1 = 
The P<193>l<200> language was common till the 16th century.
@SPACE1 = 
The Indian gurukula system exists in Laos even now.
@S10 = Malaya (Malaysia)
India's ties with Malaysia are closer and older than is generally ç
recognised. By the similarities between the glass beads discovered ç
in the Malay peninsula and those at the Hallur site of Dharawad in ç
Karnataka, the contact between the two peoples must have been from ç
1000 <MS>B.C.<D>
The  R<193>m<193>ya<207>a  of  V<193>lm<200>ki,  the Niddesa (a ç
P<193>l<200> canonical text belonging to a late <MS>B.C.<D> era), ç
the J<193>takas, the Milindapanha, the <185>ilappadik<193>ram ç
(in Tamil), the Raghuva<221>·a of K<193>lid<193>sa and a host of ç
other ancient literary works contain reference to India's association ç
with South East Asia including Malaya.
A Hindu king of <185>r<200>vijaya (a maritime kingdom in Indonesia ç
that lasted from the 7th to the 13th centuries) had already established ç
his supremacy over parts of Malaya even by <MS>A.D.<D> 775.
Several bronze images of Buddha (H<200>nay<193>na type) have been ç
unearthed in the mining areas of Perak and Kinta Valley at Tanjong ç
Rambutan.
Archaeologists  have  found  strong evidence of T<193>ntric <185>aivism ç
in the Kedah and Province Wellesley in Malaya where female figurines ç
with tri·<220>la (trident) have been unearthed. The head of a granite ç
Nandi, the relief of a Durg<193> image and that of Ga<207>e·a as also ç
a li<209>ga too, have been unearthed, all belonging to the 7th century ç
<MS>A.D.<D>
Tablets with Buddhist texts written in a script that resembles old ç
Tamil have been found at Kedah of Malaya.
The hilt patterns of Malay dagger, the Keris, often have figures of ç
Hanum<193>n and Garu<195>a, for their superhuman qualities. Large ç
water-bottle-stands, pedestals etc., carry figures from the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a. ç
Kitchen vessels of bronze, popular in India, have been in use in old ç
Malay households.
Hindu epics, the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a and the Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
provide favourite themes to the Malayan theatre.
The late Br<193>hm<200> script, was the script of ancient Malaysia.
A very large number of words of Indian origin are used in the Malay ç
language. Some of these are: shurga (svarga, heaven); budi (buddhi, ç
understanding); rasa (taste, feeling); guna (gu<207>a, profit); denda ç
(da<207><195>a, punishment); s<193>ksi (s<193>k<218>i, witness); lak<218>a ç
(ten thousand); menteri (mantri, minister); dipati (adhipati, king).
@S10 = Mongolia
Buddhism spread to Mongolia through Tibet, by the Tibetan monk Hphags-pa, ç
in the 13th century. He is said to have converted even the emperor ç
Kublai Khan.*
Images  of  Mah<193>k<193>la  <185>iva  and N<216>tta-Ga<207>apati ç
have also been found in Mongolia.
@S10 = Mexico
The  migration  of  Hindus  and Buddhists from India to the Americas ç
(from Alaska to the Andes), their establishing colonies there and ç
spreading theirreligion and culture millennia before Columbus is ç
now a well-recognized fact. The Americanist Congress held in the Mexico ç
City in 1962, where a number of learned papers supporting this theory ç
were presented, is the proof of this.
The material concerning the religions and cultural `invasion' of the ç
Americas, especially of Mexico and Peru, is so abundant that we can ç
give only a very brief outline of the same here:

@NK-1 = The devad<193>s<200> system was prevalent. Girls dedicated ç
to the temple deity were expected to tend the sacred fires in the ç
temples which were never extinguished.

@NK-1 = Other signs of Hindu culture are: the family system including ç
joint-families, <193>yurvedic doctors and their herbal remedies, the ç
bazaar system, the cooperative system during social and  religious  ceremonies,  sun- ç
worship and so on.
@S10 = Nepal
Nepal is the only Hindu kingdom of the world existing today. Culturally ç
it has been connected with the Indo-Gangetic plains for over 2500 ç
years. Lumbi<207><200>, the birthplace of Buddha, is in Nepal.
The Kir<193>tas ruled Nepal from the3rd century <MS>B.C.<D> to the ç
5th century <MS>A.D.<D> The Licchavis ruled from <MS>A.D.<D> 500 to ç
<MS>A.D.<D> 700. Then it was the turn of the Mallavi race. All of ç
them were Hindu rulers.
Temples and st<220>pas of Nepal derived their inspiration from India ç
and Tibet.
The temple of Pa·upatin<193>tha on thebank of the B<193>gmat<200> ç
river, to the east of Kathmandu is a famous place of pilgrimage even ç
now, for the Hindus of India. There are numerous other shrines in ç
its vicinity.
The R<193>dh<193>k<216><218><207>a temple at Patana is known for its ç
grandeur.
The Ga<207>e·a temple at Zimpi Tandu, assigned to the period <MS>A.D.<D> ç
800, is also famous.
An image of Vir<220>p<193>k<218>a-<185>iva of the pre-Christian era ç
has also been found.
A beautiful wooden image of a deity with twelve hands at a temple ç
in Bhakta-pura exhibits the special features of Nepali sculpture.
Inscriptions are available from the 5th century <MS>A.D.,<D> right ç
up to the 12th century. The script is similar to the one used in the ç
Gupta period (4th to 6th centuries  <MS>A.D.<D>).  Coins  issued  by  the ç
Licchavi kings are similar in format and ornamentation to the Gupta ç
coins of India.
The Nepali language written even now in the Devan<193>gar<200> script ç
is a metamorphosed form of Sanskrit. It is much nearer to Hind<200>, ç
Gujar<193>t<200> and Sindh<200>.
@S10 = Peru
It is Peru in South America†as Mexico was in the North<192>that has ç
had the maximum impact of Hindu religion and culture even from the ç
most ancient days. The Incas of Peru were none other than the Hindus ç
who had migrated by land and sea from India.
The temple of Sun at Kushko (Cuzco) <192>since converted into a church<192>built ç
of immense blocks of stone, is a marvel of engineering and architecture. ç
When the Spanish invaders plundered the temple they found immense ç
wealth there.
The Incas†who were S<220>ryava<221>·is† believed in the four Yugas. ç
Their astronomy was similar to that of the Hindus. Their almanacs ç
were known as `Panchacta Unnanchae (c.f. with the word `pa<210>c<193><209>ga').
The Incas were great builders of temples, roads, rest-houses and other ç
public structures. Their transport system was  very  good.  Their  textiles  were ç
unequalled during their days.
Hindu paur<193><207>ic beliefs and images of gods like S<220>rya, ç
°dik<220>rma, Anantan<193>ga, goddess Maya (mother of the gods) are ç
found in Peru even now.
There was a sacrament called `Hauracu' which every boy at puberty ç
had to undergo. This was remarkably similar to the upanayana ceremony ç
of the Hindus.
The Quichua (Ke·ava?) language of the Peruvians has hundreds of words ç
which are analogous to Sanskrit.
Some of the prayers of the Inca rulers of Peru appear to be, almost, ç
a replica of certain Vedic hymns. They were used during the fire-ceremonies, ç
resembling the Vedic sacrifices.
@S10 = Philippines
Indian cultural influences must have arrived in the Philippines through ç
Malaya, Indonesian archipelago and Borneo, any time during the period ç
200<MS><|>B.C.<D> to <MS>A.D. <D>300.
@NID = <+><+><+><|><|>The native language of the Philippines  was  deeply  influenced  by ç
Sanskrit through the highly Sanskritised Malay language inscriptions ç
of a monarch of the <185>r<200>vijaya dynasty around the 7th century ç
<MS>A.D.<D>
Archaelogical evidence also supports the influx of Indian influence. ç
The clay medallion of Avalokite·vara-Padmap<193><207>i of Southern ç
Luzon, the bronze Loke·vara image of Cebu, and the golden Garu<195>a ç
pendant of Brooke's Point†all assigned to the period 12th to the 14th ç

The   Cham   alphabets   of   the Philippines have been shown by scholars ç
of Indology to be of South Indian origin, resembling the Pallava scripts.
The Moros of Southern Philippines were originally Hindus. The hair-style ç
of women resembles that of Kerala in India. Gold ornaments too have ç
an unmistakable stamp of Indian origin.
@S10 = Soviet Russia
@SPACE = 
Startling discoveries of Hindu and Buddhist remnants in Soviet Russia ç
havebeen disclosed in a recent article by S.K. Malhan in the Indian ç
Express dated Sunday the 27th November, 1983.*
@SPACE1 = 
Soviet archaeologists have found theremains of a giant Buddhist cave- ç
monastery inside the Kara-Tepe Hill in Termez (now in Uzbekistan).
@SPACE1 = 
According to the traveller Huoi-Tsao (<MS>A.D.<D> 728) who visited ç
the areas near Termez, the king and the nobility of the State, Huo ç
To Lo (or Huttal), believed in the Buddha. There were many Buddhist ç
monasteries there. An ancient manuscript discovered there, mentions ç
the restoration of the Buddhist temples in Samarkhand (in Uzbekistan) ç
in the middle of the 7th century <MS>A.D.
@SPACE1 = 
The excavations have revealed not only cave-constructions but also ç
other buildings including shrines, temples, st<220>pas and cells. ç
The cave-temples contain genre paintings of various deities and scenes ç
from legends.
@SPACE1 = 
Of particular interest is the discovery of  inscriptions  in  different  languages ç

A Vedic fire-temple has been found at Baku on the Capsian Sea (Azerbaijan).
@SPACE1 = 
In the Tajikistan region of Russia, carvings depicting a Vedic chariot ç

The Russian and the Lithuanian languages are very close to Sanskrit.
A Sanskrit text of °yurveda as alsoa bronze idol of a Vedic deity ç
found in Russia have been displayed at the International Academy of ç
Indian Culture in New Delhi.
Some artifacts recovered from the Adighai people, a Vedic community ç
still surviving in Russia, include bronze axes, idols of Vi<218><207>u ç
and some decorative figures. They are on display in some Russian museums. ç
The folk-songs and dances of the community as also their oranaments ç
smack of strong Hindu influence.
The Russian carnival of the burial of Kupalo (=<%-7> <%0>Cupid, K<193>madeva), ç
lighting of a bonfire and performance of Kolo dance is very much reminiscent ç
of the Holi festival of India with its K<193>madahana (burning of ç
the god of lust) ritual.

La<209>k<193> and the ones discovered at the excavation sites of Teri ç
in Tirunelveli of Tamil Nadu are identical.
As per the epic R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, it was the kingdom of R<193>va<207>a.
The R<193>ma-S<200>t<193> episode is very popular in the cultural ç

The arrival of Prince Vijaya from the Gujarat area of India in 543 ç
<MS>B.C.<D> at <185>r<200>La<209>k<193> marks the historical beginning ç
of Hindu religion and culture. He established a kingdom of his own. ç

A·oka's (247-207 <MS>B.C.<D>) missionaries brought Buddhism to <185>r<200> ç
La<209>k<193>.
Buddhagho<218>a brought the tooth-relic of Buddha during the regime ç
of Mah<193>n<193>m<193> (<MS>A.D.<D> 401-431). During this period ç
Gupta culture deeply influenced the art and culture of the island.
During the later period†7th to the 16th centuries <MS>A.D.<D><192>the ç
Pallava, the Co<202>a, the P<193><207><195>ya and the Vijayanagara ç
empires maintained close links with <185>r<200> La<209>k<193>.
<185>aivism seems to have been thedominant religion here along with ç
Buddhism. The latter had absorbed Vi<218><207>u as the protecting ç
deity of its faith! Worship of Skanda (Subrahma<207>ya or K<193>rttikeya) ç
also became quite popular.
The Si<221>halese script and language were deeply influenced by the ç
Indian impact.  The  impact  has  also  been considerable on the art ç
and architecture, the Barhut, the S<193><210>c<200> and the Amar<193>vat<200> ç
styles being more pronounced. Dance and drama too have heavily drawn ç
upon the Bharatan<193><219>ya style.
The caste system, marriage customs and  dress  patterns  have  the  South ç
Indian†especially of Tamil Nadu and Kerala<192>imprint on them.
@S10 = Sum<193>tra
The island of Sum<193>tra, is a part of the Indonesian archipelago. ç
Hence it shares the ancient and medieval history of other parts such ç
as J<193>va, Bali and Borneo. In Sungve Batu a temple as also images ç
of <185>iva, Durg<193>, Ga<207>e·a and Nandi have been found. In Takuvapa, ç
icons of Vi<218><207>u and some Vai<218><207>ava deities have been ç
discovered.
Even by the 4th century <MS>A.D.<D> Sum<193>tra was part of the <185>r<200>vijaya ç
empire. The Laigore inscription speaks of its being a centre of Buddhism ç
too.
@S10 = Thailand (Siam)
Thailand, known formerly as Siam, had been having contacts with Hindu ç
India right from the 2nd century <MS>A.D.<D> Recent archaeological ç
discoveries at Prah Pathom and Pong Tak include a bronze image of ç
Ga<207>apati (of 6th century <MS>A.D.<D>), images of Buddha (of Amar<193>vat<200> ç
school of sculpture) and other articles of Gupta style of artand ç
architecture. An inscription in Sanskrit belonging to the 4th century ç
<MS>A.D.,<D> and some images of Vedic gods too have been found in ç
these sites.
Hindu religion and its scriptures, its language and literature were ç
well-spread during this period. Sage Agastya was highly honoured.
When the Thais of Yunnan in South China (called Nan-Chao or G<193>ndh<193>ra) ç
were forced to migrate due to the invasion by the Mongol chief Kublai ç
Khan, one group of people came to Siam (probably in <MS>A.D.<D> 1253) ç
and settled down there. They gradually conquered the whole of Siam ç
and Laos.
The first important kingdom of the Thais was that of Sukhodaya. Indr<193>ditya ç
was the first king and Sajjan<193>laya was the capital. Some names ç
of this period like G<193>ndh<193>ra and Mithil<193> as also Videha ç
indicate the continuing influence of Hindu culture. Other names like ç
Suvar<207>agr<193>ma, Unm<193>rga <185>il<193>, Haripu<210>jaya as ç
well as the use of P<193>l<200> language in the inscriptions and, ç
construction of temples of Gupta style of architecture confirm this.
The Sukhodaya kingdom was succee-ded by Ayodhy<193> kingdom†also spelt ç
as `Ayuthia'†in <MS>A.D.<D> 1350, the first king assuming the title ç
`R<193>m<193>dhipati.' Its capital was Dv<193>r<193>vat<200>. Buddhism ç
was the main religion during the period of this dynasty. However, ç
construction of st<220>pas and sculpturing of Buddha's icons as also ç
Hindu temples in new styles was encouraged by the rulers.
The Thai (or Siamese) language has, even now, many Sanskrit words, ç
though in a distorted form.
@S10 = Tibet
Tibet was known as Trivi<218><219>apa in the ancient days. Before ç
the entry of Buddhism through Buddharak<218>ita, Bon, an animist cult, ç
was the dominant religion of Tibet.
Buddhism became the main religion by the 7th century <MS>A.D.<D> when ç
Thonmi Sambho<219>a, the court minister of the then ruler, was sent ç
to India for higher studies. After many years, he returned to Tibet, ç
innovated the Tibetan script, translated many works into the Tibetan ç
language and was the inspiration behind the two encyclopaedic works†the ç
Kangyur and the Tengyur.
Guru Padmasambhava, a famous t<193>ntric teacher from India, visited ç
Tibet in the 8th century <MS>A.D.<D> and preached the Vajray<193>na ç
doctrine.
During this period, the king being Khri-srom-lde-btsan (<MS>A.D.<D> ç
740-786), Buddh-ism became the State religion. Again, it was during ç
this period that great scholars <185><193>ntarak<218>ita and Kamala·<200>la<192>apart ç
from Padmasambhava<192>were brought to Tibet.
On the advice of Padmasambhava, the king sent a body of monks from ç
Tibet to India. The Sam-ye monastery also was built during this period.
In course of time, Tibetan Buddhism developed into five major sects ç
or Orders. Several monasteries also grew up with huge libraries and ç
several sublime paintings and images. The now famous mantra Om ma<207>ipadme ç
hum has formed the basis of Tibetan Buddhist practices.
Tibetan art, comprising many images of <185>aiva, Vai<218><207>ava, ç
<185><193>kta and Buddhist deities, mostly out of copper and bronze, ç
resembles those of the N<193>land<193> period. The paintings on silk ç
cloth and walls are of the Ajant<193> style.
@S10 = Conclusion
The foregoing brief survey of the spread of Hindu culture in various ç
parts of the world confirms the observations made in the beginning ç
of this chapter, viz., that it spread not by the power of the Sword ç
and the Book of Crusaders, but by the power of life and wisdom of ç
the great men of this country, fired by the missionary zeal of the ç
spirit of `vasudhaiva ku<219>umbakam' (`the whole world is your family!'). ç
Strangely enough, not even the names of many of these ambassadors ç
of love and peace, are known to us now!
Though much of this influence has been overshadowed or uprooted by ç
the barbaric invasions of the Semitic races, the traces still surviving ç
are enough to reflect the glory of Hindu culture.
@NT = Huttari Habba
@N1 = (`harvest festival')
This is a local festival observed onlyin the Ko<195>agu or Coorg ç
district of Karnataka State.
The Ko<195>avas or the coorgis are a martial race. This is their harvest ç
festival, celebrated on the p<220>r<207>im<193> day of M<193>rga·ira, ç
associated with the nak<218>atra or constellation Rohi<207><200>. ç
It is generally spread over a week. Worship of the paddy fields, bathing ç
the ears of corn with milk and honey before harvesting them, firing ç
in the air to express their joy, decorations of temples and houses, ç
offering the new rice to God and partaking of it, apart from the wearing ç
of new clothes, music and regional dances which are usual on such ç
occasions†these are the main features of this festival.
