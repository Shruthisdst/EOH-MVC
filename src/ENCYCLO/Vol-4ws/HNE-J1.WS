Goddess Jagad-dh<193>tr<200> (one who is the supporter and nourisher ç
of the world) is widely worshipped by the ·<193>kta devotees, especially ç
in Bengal and the neighbouring regions. She nourishes the world by ç
providing the fourfold objectives (dharma, artha, k<193>ma and mok<218>a, ç
the four puru-<218><193>rthas) (See <MS>PURU<186>°RTHAS<D>.) to mankind. ç
She pervades the three phases of the day and is worshipped in three ç
different ways: the s<193>ttvika mode in the morning, the r<193>jasa ç
mode in the afternoon and the t<193>masa mode in the evening.
According to the K<193>ty<193>yan<200>tantra (pa<219>ala 76) she ç
appeared as a huge mass of brilliant light in front of Indra and other ç
gods, striking terror in their hearts, since they had become arrogant ç
and vain due to their prowess. When they felt humbled, the mass of ç
light transformed itself into the form of the goddess Jagad-dh<193>tr<200>.
The deity is described as seated on the back of a lion which is standing ç
onthe body of Kar<200>ndr<193>sura (elephant-demon). She is richly ç
dressed with red garments and bedecked with all ornaments. She has ç
four hands carrying ·a<209>kha (conch), cakra (discus), dhanus (bow) ç
and b<193><207>a (arrow). She has three eyes and wears a serpent as ç
the upav<200>ta (sacred thread). Her body is shining like the morning ç
sun.
Her p<220>j<193> or special worship falls on K<193>rttika ·ukla navam<200> ç
(the ninth day of the bright half of the month of K<193>rttika, usually ç
in November). The worship is offered to a clay image specially prepared ç
for the occasion and later immersed in a river or lake or a big tank.
This festival is next to Durg<193>p<220>j<193> and K<193>l<200>p<220>j<193> ç
in popularity in Bengal. According to one version, the earliest public ç
p<220>j<193> was done in Howrah in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1713. In Chandannagar, ç
the public p<220>j<193>s of Jagad-dh<193>tr<200> draw large crowds.
