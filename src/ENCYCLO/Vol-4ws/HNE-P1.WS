God Subrahma<207>ya is one of the most popular deities of Hinduism, ç
especially in Tamil Nadu. Out of the six well-known temples dedicated ç
to him, the one at Pa<202>ani is perhaps the most famous one.
Situated in the Madurai district of Tamil Nadu, it lies to the north-west ç
ofMadurai at a distance of 100 kms. (62miles).
The temple itself has been built onthe hill <185>ivagiri which is ç
40 metres (450 feet) high with 659 steps leading toit.
As per the stha<202>apur<193><207>a, or local legends, the sage Agastya ç
requested Lord <185>iva and P<193>rvat<200> to establish themselves ç
on the two hills which are now known as <185>ivagiri and <185>aktigiri, ç
which they did. Then Agastya commissioned his giant disciple I<195>umbara ç
to carry the two hills on a k<193>va<195>i (a wooden stick with two ç
baskets at the ends). On the way to his destination, I<195>umbara ç
rested his k<193>va<195>i and himself at the place now known as Pa<202>ani. ç
Meanwhile Subrahma<207>ya (also known as Skanda, Guha and <186>a<207>mukha) ç
who had come away after quarreling with his parents <185>iva and P<193>rvat<200>, ç
had settled himself on the <185>ivagiri hill making it impossible ç
for I<195>umbara even to lift his k<193>va<195>i. Finally at his request ç
Subrah-ma<207>ya made him dv<193>rap<193>laka (gate keeper) and also ç
approved his request that devotees who bring offerings in a k<193>va<195>i ç
be specially blessed.
The image is made of navap<193><218><193><207>as (nine kinds of poisons ç
or mineral substances) blended together in certain proportions resulting ç
in a wax-like substance. The sage Bhogar was the one who prepared ç
the icon (There is a shrine dedicated to him also).
Since Subrahma<207>ya came as a boy-ascetic, the image is very simple, ç
shorn of all dresses and ornaments except for kaup<200>nam (loin cloth) ç
and a da<207><195>a (a staff). Hence the deity is also called B<193>la- ç
da<207><195><193>yudhap<193><207>i (the child holding a staff as a ç
weapon). It faces west.
According to another legend, Ceraman Perum<193><202>, the king of ç
Cera dynasty, retrieved the ancient image after a dream revelation ç
and built the present temple.
Though the face of the deity is beautiful, the whole body is rough. ç
Whether it is due to the ravages wrought by time or due to the scrapping ç
of the body-surface by some sages of the siddha tradition (alchemists ç
or doctors using plant products as medicines) because of its curative ç
properties, it is difficult to say.

In fact in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 2004, an attempt was made to replace the ç
`worn out' image with a new one but it was stoutly resisted by the ç
devotees.
@SPACE1 = 
@SPACE1 = 
The image wears a garland and Rudr<193>k<218>a beads (Eleocarpus ç
ganitras).

There are six p<220>jas or ceremonial worships everyday from morning ç
to night.
@SPACE1 = 
@SPACE1 = 
As many as ten abhi<218>ekas (purificatory baths) are done every day ç
with various substances such as gingelly oil, rice powder, turmeric ç
powder, pa<210>c<193>m<216>tam (with five sweet ingredients) and vibh<220>ti ç
(ash). After the abhi<218>ekas the image is decorated in various forms.

@SPACE1 = 
The pa<210>c<193>m<216>ta is not only very tasty, but can also be ç
preserved for a long time.

The sandal paste smeared on the head of the deity on the previous ç
day isremoved only the next morning. It isbelieved to have miraculous ç
healing powers.
@SPACE1 = 
Of the various festivals celebrated at the temple, the Taip<220><218>am ç
(pu<218>yap<220>r<207>im<193>, the full moon day of pu<218>yam<193>sa, ç
generally during January-February) is the most important one.
@SPACE1 = 
Pilgrims who visit the shrine on this day observe the vow of continence ç
and walk barefooted all the way from their places. They also carry ç
the k<193>va<195>i in which they may bring a litter of wood or pots ç
of water for abhi<218>eka. On this occasion, the diamond-encrusted ç
Vel or javelin of the Lord Subrahma<207>ya of the temple at Karaikudi ç
is also ceremonially brought to this pilgrim centre.
@SPACE1 = 
The other festivals of importance are Pa<209>guni Uttaram in April ç
and Skanda <186>as<219>hi in July.
It is interesting to note that Muslims call this deity as Pa<202>anib<193>b<193> ç
and come to the temple to offer their prayer at the rear side.
@NT = Para·ur<193>makalpas<220>tra
This is a digest of <185>r<200>vidy<193> (See <MS><185>R®VIDY°<D> ç
for details.), a system of Divine Mother's worship compiled by Para·ur<193>ma ç
from several sources which were available during his day.
Though in several colophons of the manuscripts, the author is identified ç
with the Para·ur<193>ma of the epics†son of Jamadagni and Re<207>uk<193>†modern ç
scholars do not agree with the same.
It is a very terse work and can be understood only with the help of ç
the commentary Saubh<193>gyodaya of R<193>me·vara written during ç
the year <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1831.
The work consists of 328 s<220>tras spread over 10 kha<207><195>as ç
or chapters, each with a different name.
Some scholars feel that this is only the first part and that there ç
is a second part†khan<195>as 11 to 18†with 120 s<220>tras. However, ç
this is not universally conceded.

@NT = Pa·upatin<193>tha Temple
One of the most important places of pilgrimage associated with Lord ç
<185>iva is the Pa·upatin<193>tha Temple in Nepal.
It is located in Deopatan, a small town 3 kms. (2 miles) northwest ç
of K<193><219>hma<207><195>u, the capital of Nepal.
Nepal, got its name by its association with a great sage called `Nemi ç
Muni' (Sk<193>ndapur<193><207>a, Himavatkha<207><195>a, 11.60). ç
He is said to have lived near this temple and taken care of it.
Nepal is full of Hindu temples, of which the temple of Pa·upathin<193>tha ç
is the most important and the holiest.
It is not known when the temple was founded. According to one local ç
tradition, Pa·uprek<218>a of the Somadeva dynasty in the 3rd century ç
<MS>B.<|>C.<D> established it. It can safely be asserted that it is ç
at least 1500 years old.
The legend goes that Lord <185>iva and his divine spouse P<193>rvat<200>, ç
while wandering in the Him<193>layas came here, liked the place very ç
much and settled down as a `m<216>ga and m<216>g<200>' (deer-couple). ç
When the gods of heaven started searching for the `missing' couple, ç
they found a strange deer with one horn and three eyes, moving about, ç
along with a female deer. Recognising them as <185>iva and P<193>rvat<200>, ç
the gods tried to take them back to Kail<193>sa (the abode of <185>iva) ç
but failed. <185>iva gave up the deer form, assumed the Jyotirlil<209>ga ç
shape (li<209>ga of light) and settled down on the bank of river B<193>gmat<200> ç
(now in K<193><219>hma<207><195>u, the capital of Nepal).
Since he had assumed the shape of a pa·u or animal, but is really ç
the pati or Lord of all living beings, he is known as `Pa·upati' or ç
`Pa·upatin<193>tha'.
The Nep<193>lam<193>h<193>tmya (15.3-5) of the work mentioned earlier, ç
declares that this temple of Pa·upatin<193>tha is surrounded bythe ç
rivers Kau·ik<200>, Tri·<220>laga<209>g<193> and another `holy river ç
with cold waters'. `<185>ivapur<200>' (Kail<193>sa mountain?) is towards ç
the north.
The  temple  was  destroyed  by Sultan Shamsuddin of Bengal in the ç
14th Century. It was reconstructed in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1360 by Jayasi<221>ha ç
R<193>mavardhana.
The present architectural design is the result of renovation by queen ç
Ga<209>g<193>dev<200> during the reign of <185>ivasi<221>ha Malla ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1578-1620). It was rebuilt in two storeys†since the ç
old one had been destroyed by white ants†in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1692.
The temple stands in the middle of a courtyard. It is a two tiered ç
pagoda, built on a single-tier plinth. It has richly ornamented gilt ç
and silver-plated doors on all sides. On both sides of each door, ç
there are niches of various sizes containing gold-painted images of ç
guardian deities. The sanctum contains a one-meter high li<209>ga ç
of black stone with four faces representing the four aspects of <185>iva, ç
viz., Tatpuru<218>a, Aghora, Sadyoj<193>ta and V<193>madeva. The top ç
represents ®·<193>na. Each has a pair of hands in different mudr<193>s ç
or poses. The scalps have matted hair on the three faces and the fourth ç
face† half-man  and  half-woman†is  that  of Ardhan<193>r<200>·vara.

Nepal is full of Hindu temples and Buddhist Pago<195>as. Most of the ç
temples have their gopuras in the Pago<195>a-style. A few of the more ç
important ones may now be treated very briefly arranging them in the ç
English alphabetical order:

@S10 = °k<193>· Bhairav Temple
@SPACE1 = 
It is a three-storey structure in the market avenue called Indra Chowk ç
in K<193><219>hma<207><195>u. The image of °k<193>· Bhairav is displayed ç
outside for a week during the annual festival of Indraj<193>tr<193> ç
to please the god of rain.

Maru Ga<207>e·a.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = B<193>gh Bhairab
@SPACE1 = 
This famous temple of a demi-god (`Tiger-demon') is situated at Naskatipur, ç
also known as K<200>rtipur. It seems to be a counterpart of the `By<193>ghra-devat<193>'of ç
the Sunderbans forest in West Bengal. It is a ferocious deity to be ç
propitiated to escape from being killed by a tiger.
@S10 = Batsal<193>dev<200> Pagoda
This is a small shrine dedicated to Dev<200> (an aspect of P<193>rvat<200>, ç
the consort of <185>iva),  which  is  situated  near  the Pa·upatin<193>tha ç
Temple. A few centuries ago, a human sacrifice used to be offered ç
on the <185>ivar<193>tri festival day. The place has a number of sam<193>dhis ç
(structures built over burial places) with li<210>gas.
@S10 = Bhadrak<193>l<200> Temple
Situated at the eastern edge of the old city†known as Tundikhel†is ç
this temple dedicated to K<193>l<200>. It is also called Lumarhi temple ç
and is considered as one of the main <185><193>kta temples of K<193><219>hm<193><207><195><220>.
@S10 = B<220><195>h<193>n<200>laka<207><219>ha Temple
An old (b<220><195>h<193>) farmer from a village named N<200>laka<207><219>ha, ç
while digging his fields to make a water pond, found a stone image ç
of Vi<218><207>u in the reclining posture (Ananta·ayana) with the ç
hood of a large snake (<185>e<218>an<193>ga or Ananta) spread over ç
the head. The pond was made to house this image half-immersed in water.
It is about 8 kms. (5 miles) to the north-east of K<193><219>hm<193><207><195><220>.
The image†said to be at least 1500 years old†which is of stone, is ç
6 1/4 metres (20 ft.) long. The length of the tank is 13 1/2 metres ç
(43 ft.).
A temple was added later. It is visited by a large number of devotees ç
every day.
@S10 = Cha<209>gu N<193>r<193>ya<207>a Temple
Situated at the end of a long ridge which runs well into the valley, ç
it is said to have been built by the king Hari Datta in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
323. Considered as the oldest temple in the valley it was listed in ç
the UNESCO World Heritage Monument list in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1979.
The present Pagoda type temple was rebuilt in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1702.
It is just 4 kms. (2.5 miles) to the north of Bhaktpur (Bha<195>g<193>on) ç
town.
The image is Vi<218><207>u riding on Garu<195>a.
@S10 = Datt<193>treya Temple
Assigned to <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1427, this temple is said to have been built ç
from the trunk of a single tree. There is a monastery nearby with ç
exquisitely carved windows.
@S10 = Gokar<207>a
It is 10 kms. (6 miles) to the northeast of Kh<193><219>hm<193><207>d<220>. ç
Here, the river B<193>gmati flows from south to north. This place ç
is considered a holy spot fit for performing the ·r<193>ddhas (obsequial ç
ceremonies) of one's ancestors.
There is a temple here in the pagodastyle dedicated to <185>iva (called ç
Gokar<207>e·vara).
This place has been developed as a sanctuary for wild animals.
@S10 = Guhe·var<200> Temple
It is a small temple in the Pa·upati-n<193>tha temple complex. The ç
image is said to have been unearthed at the instance of a pious br<193>hma<207>a, ç
by the king Prat<193>p Malla.
@S10 = Macchendran<193>th Temple
Macchendran<193>th (Matsyendran<193>tha) temple†he is the guardian ç
deity†is in the town of Patan. According to one version he was the ç
guru of Gorakhn<193>th (Gorak<218>a-n<193>tha). Another version identifies ç
him with the Buddhist deity Avalokite·vara.
The deity is red-faced and is clothed in bright apparel.
During the chariot festival in Bai·<193>kh (April), the idol is taken ç
out to ensure good rains.
@S10 = Muktin<193>tha Temple
Situated in the district of Mustang, on a high mountain range, this ç
famous temple is dedicated to Lord Vi<218><207>u. Its altitude is ç
3749 metres (12,300 ft.)
Set into the wall around it are 108 water spouts from which pour holy ç
water. Nearby is the Jv<193>l<193>mukh<200> M<193><200> Temple containing ç
a spring and an eternal flame.
@S10 = Naulakha Mandir
This is the temple dedicated to Mother S<200>t<193>, the consort of ç
R<193>ma. It is situated in the place called Janakpur.
There is a beautiful marble statue of S<200>t<193>.
Religious festivals and fairs are held on R<193>manavam<200> day.
@S10 = S<220>rya Vin<193>yak
Situated in a beautiful surrounding at Bha<195>g<193>on, this temple ç
is dedicated to Ga<207>e·a. The first rays of the Rising sun fall ç
on it everyday. It has attracted the visitors as a good picnic spot.
The temples of Nepal have some common but unique features. They are ç
mostly in the Buddhist pagoda style. Artificial lights are not allowed ç
inside. Non Hindus are nor permitted to enter the temples. Hindu culture ç
has been strictly maintained. In some temples evendalits (persons ç
of lowest castes like untouchables) are permitted to perform worship ç
as priests.
@NT = Prado<218>a
@N1 = (`beginning of night')
Certain  parts  of  the  day  are considered very auspicious for the ç
performance of religious rites. Prado<218>a is one of them. It is ç
two gha<219>ik<193>s (24 x 2 = 48 minutes) after sunset.
This period of time is said to be good for the worship of <185>iva.
The word is also used in a technical sense in religious literature. ç
It is trayoda·<200> or the thirteenth day in each fortnight of a lunar ç
month.
As regards the reason for its being considered dear to <185>iva, there ç
is a paur<193><207>ik story.
When the ocean of milk was being churned by the devas and asuras (gods ç
and demons) to get am<216>ta (ambrosia) it was h<193>l<193>hala, a ç
deadly poison, that emerged first. At the earnest entreties of both ç
of them, Lord <185>iva drank it and saved the worlds. This was on ç
the dv<193>da·<200> or the twelfth day of the lunar month. In their ç
joy of relief, both the devas and asuras forgot to thank <185>iva. ç
However, when they remembered it the next day†trayoda·<200> or the ç
thirteenth day†they all rushed to him and profusely thanked him. <185>iva ç
was naturally highly pleased with them.
Henceforward, the trayoda·<200> of every lunar month came to be regarded ç
as very auspicious and specially dear to <185>iva.
@SPACE1 = 
There are two prado<218>as in every lunar month, in the ·ukla and ç
k<216><218><207>a pak<218>as†the bright and dark fortnights. They ç
are named according to the weekday on which they fall. For instance, ç
somaprado<218>a (on Monday), kujaprado<218>a (on Tuesday) and so on.
However, ·aniprado<218>a (on Saturday) has been reckoned as extremely ç
auspicious since that was the very first prado<218>a and the evil ç
effects of <185>ani (the planet Saturn) are offset by the grace of ç
<185>iva.
@SPACE1 = 
Similarly somaprado<218>a (on Monday) is also considered good since ç
the goddess P<193>rvat<200> is specially gracious on that day. She ç
is said to give good health to the votary.
Sometimes, special results are predicated for the observance of prado<218>avrata ç
on other days also. For instance, kuja-prado<218>a  cures  diseases.  Budhaprado<218>a ç
fulfils  desires.  Guruprado<218>a  destroys enemies.
In the worship of <185>iva, bathing the <185>ivali<209>ga, the emblem ç
of <185>iva, is very important. Apart from water, various other liquids ç
can also be used, depending on the result the votary desires. The ç
following table can give an idea of this, as prescribed in the works ç
on the worship of <185>iva.

For those who observe the prado<218>a as a vrata (religious vow) fasting ç
is compulsory.
Special mention should be made of the unique temple of Lord <185>iva ç
at the village Surutapalli, 56 kms. (35 miles) form Chennai. The temple ç
is called Palli-ko<207><195>e·vara Temple and the image of <185>iva ç
in the ·ayana (lying) posture is known as Vi<218><193>pah<193>ran<193>r.
According to the local legends, when <185>iva drank the poison H<193>l<193>hala, ç
he felt dizzy and slept, keeping his head on the lap of P<193>rvat<200>. ç
All the gods who came to meet him had to wait until he woke up.
@NT = Prayogama<210>jar<200>
The Prayogama<210>jar<200> or the Ma<210>jar<200> for short, is ç
one of the earliest and the most important compendiums dealing with ç
temple construction and temple rituals. Later works like ®·<193>na·ivagurudevapaddhati ç
and Tantrasamuccaya have drawn upon this work quoting profusely ç
from it.
Though it is concerned more with the temples of Kerala, there is enough ç
material for those who want to study about Hindu temples and the associated ç
rituals.
The author of this work is Ravi, a Namp<220>tiri (or Namb<220>diri) ç
br<193>hma<207>a scholar. He is believed to have lived between the ç
10th and 11th centuries <MS>A.<|>D.<D> His father was A<218><219>am<220>rti ç
and he belonged to the K<193>·yapagotra. The family belonged to the ç
lineage known as M<193><219>harakula. Hisplace has been identified ç
with the modern Cemparakulangara shrine area in Northern Kerala.
The work has a Sanskrit commentary by Trivikrama (15th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>).
The Prayogama<210>jar<200> has 21 pa<219>alas or chapters. They ç
are:
°c<193>ryaparigraha (selection of the preceptor); Bh<220>parigraha ç
(taking possession of the site for building the temple); V<193>stuy<193>ga ç
(ceremonies to purify the site) I<218><219>ak<193>dh<193>na (laying ç
of the bricks for the basement); Garbh<193>dh<193>na (construction ç
of the sanctum sanctorum wherein the image of the deity is to be installed ç
for worship); Pr<193>s<193>dalak<218>a<207>a (styles and types of ç
temples); <185>il<193>lak<218>a<207>a (varieties of the stone granite); ç

fertility of the land); Jal<193>dhiv<193>sana (placing the idol in ç
holy water); R<193>k<218>oghna-v<193>stu (rites for destroying the ç
evil effects); Li<209>ga·uddhi (purification of the idol with different ç
materials); Adhiv<193>sana (preliminary purification before the installation); ç
Prati<218><219>h<193> (the ceremony of installation); Arcan<193> (ritualistic ç
worship); Caturthadivasa snapana (bathing the idol on the fourth day); ç
Utsava (festivals); T<200>rtha-sn<193>navidhi (dipping of the idol ç
in holy gh<193><219>s); Sn<193>na (ceremonial bath) J<200>r<207>oddh<193>ravidhi ç
(rules for the renovation of dilapidated shrines).
The treatment is general and therefore can be adopted in the case ç
of any deity, with minor variations where needed.

@N1 = (`Song of [Mother] Earth')
This short work of 14 verses is a part of the Bh<193>gavata (vide ç
12.3.1-14). It is classed among the minor G<200>t<193>s spread over ç
the Mah<193>bh<193>rata and the Bh<193>gavata.
<185>uka, the narrator of the Bh<193>gavata to the king Par<200>k<218>it, ç
describes in this section how Bh<220>dev<200> or the Mother Earth ç
derisively speaks about the kings and emperors who ruled over her ç
and then disappeared into the void.
The teaching may be summarised as follows:
Seeing the kings who are engaged in thinking of conquering her, Bh<220>dev<200> ç
(Mother Earth) laughs, saying, `Ah! These kings who are playthings ç
in the hands of Death, want to conquer me!'
`Eventhough these kings may be learned ones, since they are extremely ç
attached to their flimsy bodies perishable like foam, their desires ç
will be in vain.
@SPACE1 = 
`They think†``After first practising self-control, we will then conquer ç
the ministers of the enemy kings. Then we will conquer the commanders ç
of the armies, and the influential subjects thereby removing all obstacles ç
to power.
``In this way, gradually we will conquer the whole earth bordered ç
by the seas.'' With their hearts dominated by such ambitions they ç
fail to notice Death standing nearby.
`Some kings, even after conquering me†who has subjugated all the land ç
up to the seas†enter into the sea to conquer the islands there. However, ç
this is nothing compared to the conquest of oneself, for which mok<218>a ç
or liberation is the fruit.

`The (fourteen) Manus and their sons left me and went the way they ç
came from. And, the foolish people conquer me through wars!
@SPACE1 = 
`The evil kings thinking (due to attachment) that the kingdom is theirs, ç
fight even with their fathers or sons or brothers, for my sake.
`Saying that the entire earth belongs to them, these foolish ones ç
quarrel among themselves and even kill one another, for my sake.
@EMERGEN1 = `Many Kings* like P<216>thu and Pur<220>rava, right up ç
to the r<193>k<218>asa kings,who were all-knowing and heroic, considering ç

@SPACE = 
The various subjects dealt with in this work may now be dealt with ç
briefly under different headings.
@S10 = Pura·cara<207>a
Pura·cara<207>a is actually a special religious rite consisting of ç
five steps. They are: japa (repetition of the mantra received from ç
the guru); homa (ritual oblations into a duly consecrated fire); tarpa<207>a ç
(satiating the deity through offering water or milk); m<193>rjana ç
(sprinkling water on one's own head with the mantra of the deity); ç
br<193>hma<207>a bhojana (feeding the br<193>hma<207>as).
The whole process is centred round the primary requisite called d<200>k<218><193>, ç
ceremonially receiving the mantra (sacred formula or word) from a ç
qualified guru.
@S10 = The Guru
Only a person of purity with a fund of knowledge of all aspects of ç
the subject and  endowed  with  the  competence necessary to give ç
d<200>k<218><193> can become a guru.
The following are some of the traits he is expected to possess: a ç
pleasant appearance;  expert  knowledge  of  the <193>gamas  and  the  methods  of  giving ç
mantras; introversion; power of grace andadmonition; compassion towards ç
all beings; self-control; contentment; love of disciples; impartiality; ç
engaging in pure and prescribed activities; respect towards women; ç
equanimity; freedom from the ari<218>a<195>varga or six evils like ç
lust and anger; detachment towards women and wealth.
@S10 = The Disciple
If the guru has to be well-qualified to give d<200>k<218><193>, the ç
·i<218>ya or the disciple too must possess basic traits of character ç
conducive to s<193>dhan<193> or spiritual practice.
Some of these have been listed as follows: desire for mok<218>a or ç
liberation; faith in and great respect towards the guru; a certain ç
degree of self-control and purity of mind; devotion to truth; alert ç
intelligence, capable of grasping the guru's teaching quickly; control ç
over speech; devoted service to the guru; humility; dexterity in action.
@S10 = D<200>k<218><193>
When a mantra is given by the guru (`d<200>yate') the sins of the ç
disciple are destroyed (`k<218><200>yate'). Hence the process is called ç
d<200>k<218><193>.
D<200>k<218><193> is of four kinds: Kriy<193>vat<200>, Var<207>amay<200>, ç
Kal<193>vat<200> and Vedhamay<200> (Seeunder <MS>TANTRAS<D>.).
Sometimes three more are added. They are: spar·ad<200>k<218><193>, ç
v<193>gd<200>k<218><193> and d<216>gd<200>k<218><193> (See under <MS>TANTRAS<D>.).
Though d<200>k<218><193> can be taken at all times, the three seasons†vasanta ç
(spring), ·arad (autumn) and ·i·ira (winter)†are recommended  as  better.  And,  s<220>rya- ç
graha<207>a or the time of solar eclipse has been especially favoured ç
as extremely auspicious.
As regards the spots suitable for d<200>k<218><193>, the work mentions ç
16 places. Out of these, a pilgrim centre and a <185>iva temple are ç
considered as best.
It is interesting to note that different places have been favoured ç
as suitable for the japa of different mantras, as follows:
Bank of Narmad<193> river for Ga<207>e·amantra; Prabh<193>sa and Kuruk<218>etra ç
for S<220>ryamantra; Gay<193> and Dv<193>rak<193> for Vi<218><207>umantra; ç
bank of Ga<209>g<193> river and R<193>me·varam for <185>iva mantra; ç
Jv<193>l<193>mukh<200> and Pray<193>ga for <185>akti or Dev<200> mantra.
However, dilapidated places as also crowded places must be totally ç
avoided.
As per this and other traditional treatises, the d<200>k<218><193> ç
has to be given in a specially erected ma<207><195>apa or shed built ç
strictly according to stipulated norms.
@S10 = Mantras and Cakras
Mantra is that syllable or word or words by reflecting upon which, ç
one can get all knowledge and is protected against the bondage of ç
sa<221>s<193>ra or transmigratory existence.
A mantra and the deity it represents are identical.
About  54  mantras  pertaining  to various deities (including several ç
aspects of the same deity) have been given in this work.
Some of these deities are: Annap<220>r<207><193>; B<193>l<193>; C<193>mu<207><195><193>; ç
Dak<218>i<207><193>m<220>rti; Durg<193>; Ekaja<219><193>;  Ga<207>e·a;  Gaur<200>;  Hanum<193>n; ç
Hayagr<200>va; K<193>l<200>; K<193>rttav<200>ry<193>rjuna; K<216><218><207>a; ç
Kubera; Mah<193>lak<218>m<200>; M<216>tyu<210>jaya; N<216>si<221>ha;  Para·ur<193>ma;  R<193>ma;  <185>ani; ç
Sarasvat<200>; S<200>t<193>; <185><200>tal<193>; S<220>rya; Tvarit<193>; ç
Ucchi<218><219>a-ga<207>apati; V<193>mana; Vanadurg<193>; Yama.
When a would-be disciple approaches a guru for mantrad<200>k<218><193>, ç
it is the responsi-bility of the guru to find out a mantra that suits ç
him. This can be done by consulting an appropriate cakra or table. ç
The treatise has mentioned eleven cakras with the associated details. ç
They are Ahibalacakra; Aka<195>amacakra; Akathahacakra; Kul<193>kulacakra; ç
K<220>rmacakra; Nak<218>atracakra; R<193>·icakra; <184><207>idhanicakra; ç
<186>a<219>padam<193>t<216>k<193>cakra; Uditacakra; Vargacakra.
Except  the  K<220>rmacakra,  all  the others are used in determining ç
the suitabi- lity of a mantra for the disciple. Generally the first ç
letter of the name of the disciple and the first letter of the proposed ç
mantra are checked through these cakras to know whether it is suitable ç
for him.
In the case of the Nak<218>atracakra, the suitability of a mantra ç
is determined by referring to the birth nak<218>atra of the disciple ç
and the nak<218>atra of the first letter of the mantra as given in ç
the table.
As regards the R<193>·icakra, similar calculation is done based on ç
the r<193>·i of birth of the disciple and the r<193>·i of the first ç
letter of the mantra as found in the table.
@S10 = Niyamas or Rules
A disciple who wants to undertake pura·cara<207>a has to regulate ç
his life by following some basic rules: Getting up at the br<193>hm<200>muh<220>rta ç
(about one hour before sunrise), finishing ablutions and bath, completing ç
the usual daily rituals like sandhy<193> and p<220>j<193>. The disciple ç
can then start his pura·cara<207>a.
Other rules mentioned are: sleeping on the ku·a-mat spread on the ç
ground; observing brahmacarya (continence) and mauna (silence); taking ç
s<193>ttvik food like milk, fruits and vegetables; serving theguru; ç
performing special p<220>j<193>s when prescribed; chanting of hymns ç
and singing devotional songs.
He has to completely avoid taking food in others' houses, the ari<218>a<195>vargas ç
(the six enemies of spiritual life like lust and anger), evil speech ç
and falsehood, profane music and decorating one's person.
Once he fixes the number of the japa (as for instance, 100 m<193>l<193>s ç
per day), he should strictly keep it up, doing neither more nor less.
It has been suggested that he should have food only once and that ç
too, at night.
If any of these rules are broken the pr<193>ya·cittas (expiations) ç
prescribed for them like the japa of the G<193>yatr<200>, should be ç
performed.
@S10 = °sanas or Seats
The <193>sanas or seats normally recommended to be used during the ç
pura·cara<207>a rites should be made of any of the following materials; ç
Ku·a grass (Poa cynosuroides); ajina (deer-skin); ambara (soft cotton) ç
and kambala (wool).
As  regards  the  woollen  seats, different coloured ones are prescribed ç
for different results such as white one for dharma (virtue) or red ç
one for artha (gaining wealth).
If the pura·cara<207>a is being done for the fulfilment of any particular ç
desire†by repeating the appropriate mantra†then different kinds of ç
seats are prescribed as follows:

@Z_TBL_END = 
Seats used in sorcerous rites should be of various colours, as for ç
instance, black for harming, red for controlling, others.
A seat made of buffalo skin is recommended for m<193>ra<207>a (killing) ç
rites.
The following materials should never be used in manufacturing the ç
seats: wood, grass, stone and clay. They will produce harmful effects.
@S10 = °sanas or Postures
The  following  <193>sanas  or  yogic postures are recommended for ç
japa of the mantra, during pura·cara<207>a: K<220>rm<193>sana; Padm<193>sana; ç
Siddh<193>sana; Svastik<193>sana; V<200>r<193>sana.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Japam<193>l<193>s or Rosaries
@SPACE1 = 
A japam<193>l<193> is used for keeping the count during japa.
@SPACE1 = 
The m<193>l<193>s are made of various materials such as rudr<193>k<218>a ç
(Elaeocarpus ganitrus), ma<207>i (precious stones such as coral ç
or pearl), ·a<209>kha (conch), spha<219>ika (crystal), padmab<200>ja ç
(lotus-seeds) and dried sticks of tulas<200> (holy basil).
@SPACE1 = 
Sometimes other materials like ku·a grass (Poa cynosuroides), beads ç
of gold or iron or copper and l<193>k<218><193> (lac) are also used, ç
mostly for desire-motivated rites.
@SPACE1 = 
Of all the m<193>l<193>s, rudr<193>k<218>a m<193>l<193>s are considered ç
as the best and therefore most widely used.
@SPACE1 = 
A rudr<193>k<218>a bead may have 1 to 14 mukhas or faces, each one ç
giving a different result.
@SPACE1 = 
The m<193>l<193>s are generally prepared by stringing with thread. ç
Cotton thread has to be used for Vai<218><207>av<200>m<193>l<193>s ç
(m<193>l<193>s used by Vai<218><207>avas to count Vi<218><207>u mantras). ç
For <185>aiv<200>m<193>l<193>s (used by <185>aivas and <185><193>ktas ç
to count <185>iva's or Dev<200>'s mantras) woollen thread or bark-thread ç
is preferred.
@SPACE1 = 
The thread should be threefold and should have no knots.
@SPACE1 = 
A new m<193>l<193> should first be washed in pa<210>cagavya (See <MS>PA<178>CAGAVYA<D>.) ç
and then worshipped with certain Vedic mantras.
@SPACE1 = 
Counting of the mantras can be done by using the fingers of the hand, ç
i.e., by using the spaces between the joints in thefingers. This ç
is given the name, `karam<193>l<193>'.
@S10 = Some Related Topics
Quite  a  few  topics  have  been discussed in this work which are ç
related to the main subject of pura·cara<207>a. They may now be described ç
briefly.
If a disciple is unable to take bath before d<200>k<218><193> due ç
to health reasons or other factors like old age ailments or even vagaries ç
of weather he is given mantra-sn<193>na or dhy<193>nasn<193>na.
Mantrasn<193>na consists of sprinkling water on one's feet, <193>camana ç
(See <MS>°CAMANA<D>.), and some simple ny<193>sas (Seeunder <MS>TANTRAS<D>.).
Dhy<193>nasn<193>na is done by meditating on Vi<218><207>u and imagining ç
that the water springing from his feet is falling on one's head, entering ç
into the body through the brahmarandhra (aperture on the top of the ç
head) and thus purifying the whole body.
As regards giving the mantra by the guru, he has to keep his right ç
hand on the head of the disciple and utter the mantra in his right ç
ear thrice.
Though mantras can be given to women and ·<220>dras also, only those ç
mantras ending in `nama<199>' should be given and not others.
If, by chance, a mantra is received in dream, if that mantra is in ç
accordance with the scriptural injunctions, it can be taken, after ç
writing it in vermillion on a banyan leaf and placing it before a ç
kala·a (pot of water) in which one's guru is invoked.
@S10 = Japa or Repetition of the Divine name
Since the whole rite of pura·cara<207>a is  centred  round  japa,  some  details ç
regarding the same have to be given.
Japa can be practised at all times. However pura·cara<207>a has to ç
be started on the a<218><219>am<200> (eighth day) or the caturda·<200> ç
(fourteenth day) of both the fortnights.
@SPACE1 = 
As regards the number it can be: 1008; 554; 300; 108.
@SPACE1 = 
The  mantra  should  be  repeated neither fast nor slowly, but at ç
medium speed.
@SPACE1 = 
Though there are three ways of doing japa†v<193>cika (loudly), up<193><221>·u ç
(in whispering tone) and m<193>nasa (mentally)†m<193>nasajapa is recommended ç
as the best.
@SPACE1 = 
Before using the japam<193>l<193>, it has to be propitiated with certain ç
mantras.
@SPACE1 = 
While using it for japa, use it with the right hand held near the ç
heart, only the middle finger for supporting it should be used keeping ç
the index finger away. The beads have to be pulled downwards with ç
the thumb, one at a time, simultaneous with the repetition of the ç
mantra. The meru (the centrally fixed extra bead) should never be ç
crossed.
@SPACE1 = 
For all k<193>mya rites, japam<193>l<193> must be used.
@SPACE1 = 
At the end of each session of japa, its result has to be offered at ç
the feet of the deity of the mantra, in the prescribed manner.
@SPACE = 
@SPACE = 
@S10 = K<220>rmacakra
@SPACE1 = 
Once the s<193>dhaka who has taken mantrad<200>k<218><193> or initiation ç
in a mantra, from a qualified guru, decides to do pura·cara<207>a, ç
especially for a particular purpose, he should choose a good place ç
for its performance. This can be anywhere, in a city, in a village ç
or even in one's own house.
On the spot thus selected, the K<220>rmacakra has to be inscribed. ç
First, a square has to be drawn with nine squares inside it. Then ç
the drawing of a K<220>rma or tortoise has to be inscribed in it, ç
with the head towards the east and tail towards the west. Various ç
letters of the Sanskrit alphabet have to be written inside it in the ç
prescribed manner.
@SPACE1 = 
The s<193>dhaka is advised to sit in the place of the mukha (head ç
or face) for japa to get the maximum results. Sitting in other places ç
of the cakra gives inferior results, the worst being the tail portion.
@SPACE1 = 
However, in sacred places of pil-grimage, the K<220>rmacakra is not ç
necessary.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Havana or Homa
@SPACE1 = 
After japa, havana or homa has to be done. The number of offerings ç
is 1/10 of the number of japa. For instance, if the japa done for ç
that day is 10,000, the homa-offerings should be 1000.
@SPACE1 = 
The fire for the homa can be brought from the house of a br<193>hma<207>a. ç
Alternatively, it can also be generated by striking flint stones or ç
by ara<207><200>s (See <MS>ARAØI<D> for details.).
@SPACE1 = 
The mantra for the offering is the same as the m<220>lamantra (original ç
mantra) used in japa. However, the format is adjusted suitably for ç
homa. It the m<220>lamantra is `R<193>ma', the mantra for havana will ç
be `O<221> R<193>m<193>ya sv<193>h<193>'.
@SPACE1 = 
@SPACE1 = 
The fire can be placed in a ku<207><195>a (pit) or a small platform ç
or even on the ground.
@SPACE1 = 
The work prohibits women and ·<220>dras from performing homa. Instead, ç
they have to do more japa.
@S10 = Tarpa<207>a or Satiation
Tarpa<207>a is done by offering milk or water to the deity using the ç
same mantra as for havana.
The number should be 1/10 of the number of offerings in homa. In the ç
example quoted above, it should be 100.
This milk or water is expected to be consumed by the performer-s<193>dhaka.
@S10 = M<193>rjana or Wiping
Using the m<220>lamantra with `nama<199>' (for e.g., `R<193>m<193>ya ç
nama<199>') water has to be sprinkled on one's own head with kumbhamudr<193>. ç
The number of such m<193>rjanas is 1/10 that of tarpa<207>a. In the ç
example given, it comes to 10.
@S10 = Br<193>hma<207>abhojana
Br<193>hma<207>abhojana or feeding the br<193>hma<207>as is the last ç
item of pura·cara<207>a.
The number of br<193>hma<207>as to be invited is 1/10 that of m<193>rjana. ç
In the example given above, it comes to one.
The br<193>hma<207>as should be invited with great respect and taken ç
care of properly. They should be fed well with <218>a<195>rasa-bhojana ç
or food of six kinds. Proper dak<218>i<207><193> (gifts) should also ç
be offered.
This last rite is said to be so powerful that it can offset all the ç
defects that might have crept in, during the performance of pura·cara<207>a.
After the pura·cara<207>a is completed, the guru has to be suitably ç
honoured with food, clothes and other presents.
@SPACE = 
@SB = Conclusion
@SPACE = 
If due to any reason, havana and other rites cannot be performed, ç
the treatise prescribes extra japa to compensate for the same.
It is thus seen that the work covers all important aspects of pura·cara<207>a ç
and can be a good handbook to all the s<193>dhakas of mantrajapa.
It has paid particular attention to the chanting and all the associated ç
rituals of the Sapta·at<200> or Durg<193>sapta·at<200> at the ç
end, since that work is considered as a basic scripture of mantra·<193>stra, ç
the seince of mantras.
