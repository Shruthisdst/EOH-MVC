The Mah<193>ny<193>sa involves the worshipof Lord <185>iva in great ç
detail. (See <MS>MAH°NY°SA<D>.) When, due to any valid reason the ç
votary cannot perform it, a shorter version of the same called `Laghuny<193>sa' ç
has been prescribed.
The following are the more important steps involved in this Laghuny<193>sa:
Physical preparations for the worship; preliminary prayer to <185>iva ç
that helps in fixing the mind on him; <216><218>y<193>diny<193>sa ç
(statement about the <216><218>i or the sage who discovered it, the ç
devat<193> or the deity and the purpose); placing the various deities ç
like Brahm<193>, Vi<218><207>u, Hara, Indra and others on one's limbs ç
through imagination with appropriate mantras; <193>hv<193>na or inviting ç
the deity <185>iva to be present to accept the worship; offering the ç
various upac<193>ras (modes of direct service) like <193>sana (seat ç
for sitting), p<193>dya and arghya (water for washing feet and hands) ç
etc., right up to sn<193>na or bath; bathing the <185>ivali<209>ga ç
with the mantras of the Rudra and Camaka; offering of other items ç
of worship like cloth, flowers, bilva leaves, lighted lamp and food.
One who worships <185>iva in this way is blessed with many fruits ç
like destruction of sins, gaining wealth and health, attaining longevity, ç
getting children, as also powers of the intellect.

India has produced quite a good number of man-saints whose extra-ordinary ç
spiritual wisdom or devotion to God was unparallelled. However, equally ç
great have been the women-saints though their number was comparatively ç
less.
One such, a gem among them, was Lalle·var<200> of Kashmir. Lall<193>, ç
Lall<193> Ded, L<193>l Ded and Lallayog<200>·var<200> were the other ç
names by which she was known. She lived in the 14th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>
She was born in the family of Kashmiri Pa<207><195>its belonging to ç
the <185>aiva tradition, in the town of Pa<207><195>rent<193>n (or ç
Pur<193><207><193>dhi<218><219>h<193>na) near Srinagar. At the age ç
of twelve, she was married to Nic<193>b<193>t of Pamp<193>pura (or ç
Padm<193>pura). She was renamed as Padm<193>vat<200> by her father- ç
in-law.
Though  her  mother-in-law  was harassing her severely, she silently ç
put up with it for a long period of twelve years. However, finding ç
it impossible to bear it any more, she abandoned the house and the ç
family, and started roaming about like a mendicant, in search of <185>iva, ç
her Lord.
Fortunately, in her wanderings, she succeeded in getting a great guru ç
(spiritual teacher) known as Siddhan<193>tha. Under his guidance, ç
she became an adept in yoga and spiritual wisdom. After thus attaining ç
perfection, she resumed her peripatetic life during which period many ç
persons became her disciples or followers. She alsomet many sa<221>ny<193>sins ç
(monks) and Muslim Fakirs (holy-men) with whom she used to hold discussions. ç
It is said that she could remember her previous lives and also had ç
many yogic powers.
During such wanderings she would often go into ecstacy, dance and ç
sing songson her Lord <185>iva. Quite a few of these compositions†all ç
in the Kashmiri language†have been preserved. Some of them have also ç
been published with English  translation.  Though  they  are apparently ç
couched in a simple language, they are pregnant with high philosophical ç
content.
Nothing is known about her final days and demise.
As regards her teachings contained in her songs, admirable service ç
has been done by one pa<207><195>it, Bh<193>skar<193>c<193>rya by ç
name, who has rendered them in Sanskrit, in sixty beautiful verses.
Her struggles towards perfection passed through several stages. In ç
the first stage, she had several questions to ask, several doubts ç
to be cleared. Some of themare:
1. I do not know from where I came and to where I go. Yet, the desire ç
to know Him is sustaining me.
2. O Guru! Please teach me that which will enlighten me.
3. Wandering around the places of pilgrimage or praising Him through ç
songs did not help me much. Finally I discovered Him in myself.
In  the  second  stage  she  acquired the  knowledge  of  the  scriptures.  She ç
discovered that M<193>y<193> (cosmic illusory power) binds whereas ç
true knowledge liberates.
In the third stage she concentrated on s<193>dhan<193>s or spiritual ç
practices. She discovered that:
1. Mind is responsible for bondage and liberation.
2. One should be controlled in eating as also other enjoyments.
3. Pr<193><207><193>y<193>ma (breath-control) helps in controlling ç
the mind, as also mauna (observing silence).
4. Real worship of God is accomplished by meditation rather than by ç
external rituals.
In the fourth stage she refers to herspiritual experiences. She attained ç
equanimity of mind and realised the importance of Pra<207>ava or Om.
In the fifth or the last stage, she describes as to how she lived ç
as a free bird after realising her Lord <185>iva, inside herself. ç
She had totally transcended the six evils like lust and anger.
Her philosophy of life was what is now known as Kashmir <185>aivism.
