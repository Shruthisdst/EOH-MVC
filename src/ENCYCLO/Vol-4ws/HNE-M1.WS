Rudra or <185>iva, along with Vi<218><207>u or N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, ç
is a primary deity of the Hindu pantheon. He is said to be fond of ç
abhi<218>eka or ceremonial bathing. Rudr<193>bhi<218>eka or ceremonial ç
bathing of the <185>ivali<209>ga by the process of Mah<193>ny<193>sa ç
is an extremely important part of <185>ivap<220>j<193> or worship ç
of <185>iva.
According to the tradition set up by Baudh<193>yana (circa 600 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) ç
one who wants to worship Rudra must himself feel his identity with ç
Rudra first and then only start the worship. The ritualistic process ç
by which this is done is Mah<193>ny<193>sa.  Here  the  arcaka  or  the ç
worshipper establishes the various limbs (nyas = to keep or establish) ç
of Rudra or <185>iva in his own body as also those of his pariv<193>radevatas ç
(attendant gods) to feel fully identified with <185>iva himself.
The Mah<193>ny<193>sa involves a very long process of ritualistic ç
worship of <185>iva comprising 49 steps! Only a few of these steps, ç
the more important ones, may be briefly dealt with here.
The whole process starts with the usual preliminaries involved in ç
p<220>j<193> or ritualistic worship like <193>camana (ceremonial  sipping  of  water)  and  sa<209>kalpa ç
(religious resolve) stating the intention as also the procedure to ç
be adopted. This is then followed by several ny<193>sas like pa<210>camukhany<193>sa ç
wherein the several aspects of Rudra-<185>iva are invoked into one's ç
own body by the worshipper. The next steps are da·<193><209>ga and ç
<218>o<195>a·<193><209>ga raudr<200>kara<207>a  wherein  Rudra-<185>iva  is ç
invoked to be established in one's limbs like the forehead, ears, ç
eyes and face.
Then comes the <218>a<195>a<209>gany<193>sa involving the six limbs ç
like the heart, the head and the tuft of hair to the accompaniment ç
of Vedic mantras like the Puru<218>as<220>kta.
@EMERGEN1 = After inviting <185>iva for worship, the various upac<193>ras ç
(modes of direct service) like <193>sana (seat), p<193>dya (water ç
for washing the feet) and arghya (water for washing the hands) are ç
offered.
This is followed by sn<193>na (bathing) with various items like scented ç
water, bhasma or holy ash, waters in which gold, rudr<193>k<218>a ç
beads (Elaeocarpus ganitrus) andd<220>rva grass (Cynodon dactylon) ç
are immersed followed by Mal<193>pakar<218>a<207>a-sn<193>na (bathing ç
to remove impurities).
Now follows the most important part of the ritual†rudr<193>bhi<218>eka†bathing ç
the<185>ivali<209>ga with pure water to the accompaniment of all ç
the mantras of the Rudrapra·na (or Rudra or Namaka) and the ç
Camaka. It is absolutely necessary that the flow of water over the ç
li<209>ga is continuous and uniform.
@EMERGEN1 = Then, the following Vedic s<220>ktas and mantras have ç
to be chanted: Puru<218>as<220>kta; <185>r<200>s<220>kta; Sadyoj<193>ta†mantras ç
of the Mah<193>n<193>r<193>ya<207>opani<218>ad; the Da·a·<193>nti ç
and the Gho<218>a·<193>nti mantras.
@EMERGEN1 = Other items of p<220>j<193> that are performed now are: ç
offering of cloth, bilva leaves,<|>rice-grains with sesame seeds, garland ç
of rudr<193>k<218>a, some specified flowers, incense, lighted lamp ç
and food.
The whole ritual closes with pradak<218>i<207>a (circumambulation) ç
and namask<193>ra (obeisance).
The t<200>rtha (holy water) and pras<193>da (consecrated food) are ç
then distributed among the devotees.

@SPACE = 
The Mantramahodadhi, as its veryname indicates (`A Great Ocean ç
of Mantras'), is a work of encyclopaedic nature, dealing exhaustively ç
with the mantras treated in the various t<193>ntrik treatises. It ç
was composed by Mah<200>dhara who has written a commentary on the ç
M<193>dhyandina·<193>kh<193> of the <185>uklayajurveda sa<221>hit<193>.
Mah<200>dhara lived in the 16th century. At the end of this work he ç
mentions that he completed it on the ·ukla-a<218><219>am<200> day ç
of the month of Jye<218><219>ha (May-June) in the Vikrama-sa<221>vatsara ç
1645 (i.e. <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1589).
He belonged to the Vatsa-gotra andwas the son of Phan<220>bha<219><219>a, ç
a greatdevotee of R<193>ma. He was born at Ahicchatra located in ç
the Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh.
Being disgusted with the worldly life he came to K<193>·<200> and ç
settled there, spending his time in worshipping and meditating on ç
god Narasi<221>ha. He wrote this treatise at the request of his son ç
Kaly<193><207>a as also some learned br<193>hma<207>as.
The work has 25 Tara<209>gas and contains 3300 verses, all in the ç
anu<218><219>ubh metre. The author himself has written a lucid commentary ç
also, named as Nauk<193>.

V<193>m<193>c<193>ratantra (See <MS><186>A<187>KARMAS<D> for details.).
On the whole this is an encyclopaedia work on mantras, covering all ç
the important aspects.
However, one word of caution has to be uttered here. As a rule, any ç
mantra has to be received ceremonially (through d<200>k<218><193>) ç
from a competent teacher before practising it.
As regards the black magical rites given at the end, they are to be ç
used only against the enemies of the society and hardened criminals ç
and that too through proper channels.
Even the desire-motivated rituals should be resorted to sparingly, ç
as a last resort.
When sincere prayer to God can give us everything we need, why depend ç
on other means?
@NT = Mantrapu<218>pa
The first section of the Taittir<200>ya °ra<207>yaka is known as ç
Aru<207>apra·na. The Mantrapu<218>pa is the 22nd anuv<193>ka in ç
it, comprising 9 mantras.
It is a common and popular Vedic prayer, often used to adore S<220>rya ç
(Sun-god) during S<220>ryanamask<193>ra as also at the end of ritualistic ç
worship of deities, while offering flowers (pu<218>p<193><210>jali).
For a person observing the rising of the sun, the moon and the stars ç
in the horizon, it looks as though they are flowers (= pu<218>pa) ç
rising from the waters (ap) ofthedistant ocean. Hence the poetic ç
description.
To the list are added the following items also: agni (fire), v<193>yu ç
(air), parjanya (rains), sa<221>vatsara (year) and various lokas or ç
worlds.
The words `ya eva<221> veda.... <193>yatanav<193>n bhavati' repeated ç
in every verse indicate that one who knows what is described, attains ç
a safe abode.
A brief summary of the text may now be attempted here:
One who knows the pu<218>pa or flower of ap or waters becomes blessed ç
with all objects of enjoyment, including children and domestic animals.

@NT = Mantra Rahasya
This is a t<193>ntrik work dealing exclusively with mantras of various ç
types used in  black-magical  rites.  It  is  in  five paricchedas ç
or sections along with a pari·i<218><219>a or appendix which is also ç
fairly long.
The whole work is in the form of ·lokas in the anu<218><219>ubh metre.
Only  a  brief  synopsis  may  be attempted here:
@S10 = First Pariccheda
It deals with the <218>a<219>karmas exhaustively, in all their aspects. ç
The <218>a<219>karmas (six types esoteric rites) are: ·<193>ntikara<207>a ç
(offsetting the evil effects of diseases or evil planetary effects); ç
va·<200>kara<207>a (bringing a person under one's control); stambhana ç
(arresting the movement of any person or living being); vidve<218>a<207>a ç
(creating enmity between friends or relatives); ucc<193><219>ana (forcing ç
a person to leave the place); m<193>ra<207>a (bringing about the death ç
of someone disliked).
Before undertaking the actual performance of these karmas the following ç
factors have to be reckoned with: suitable time (as determined by ç
referring to the almanac); dik or direction; modes of meditation on ç
the related deities; some preliminary information about the mantras ç
in general; <193>sanas or postures to be adopted; shape and size of ç
the ku<207><195>as (pits for the fire); rules concerning the establishment ç
of kala·as (ceremonially established pots of water).
Some details about japa (repetition of the mantra) like the method ç
of counting by fingers or the rosary as also the ny<193>sas are also ç
described.
The method of performing havana or homa (fire-ritual) along with associated ç
details is also given.
@S10 = Second Pariccheda
The <218>a<219>karmas are explained in detail along with the mantras ç
to be used.
By the ·<193>ntikara<207>a rites the effects of diseases like fever ç
and of sorcery rites done by others can be remedied. Great details ç
for the latter rite are given as also the particular mantra to be ç
used. By wearing a prescribed yantra (mystical diagram drawn on a ç
base like a metal plate) on the body many results can be obtained. ç
For instance: offsetting the evil effects created by anyone; a barren ç
woman conceiving; children being freed from the menace of evil spirits ç
and so on.
By the va·<200>kara<207>a rites one can bring under control any person ç
like a woman, the king, the boss, or anyone else at will.
By performing the stambhana rites one can arrest the movements of ç
any person or any weapon, the power of speech of an enemy, the power ç
of fire to burn, stop the army of the enemy or his ship and so on.
Next comes vidve<218>a<207>a. By performing this rite one can bring ç
about intense mutual hatred between persons so far well-disposed towards ç
each other.
After this comes mohana (deluding a person), by which anyone seen ç
by the s<193>dhaka becomes deluded and does his bidding. This is an ç
additional rite.
The ucc<193><219>ana procedure and mantra enable the s<193>dhaka to ç
drive away or displace his enemy.
The book adds one more rite here called  `<193>kar<218>a<207>a',  ç
meant  to  attract anybody towards oneself.
Last comes m<193>ra<207>a. This ritualistic action is aimed at getting ç
an enemy of dharma or society killed. This has to be followed by the ç
recitation of Kavacamantra to protect oneself.
The text has given several mantras as also related religious rites ç
to achieve these results, in great detail.
@S10 = Third Pariccheda
Bh<220>tin<200>s are a certain class of spirit-goddesses. They are ç
nine. The firstpart of this chapter deals with the s<193>dhan<193>s ç
connected with their worship. Different modes of their worship along ç
with the mantras are stated as also the results of their vision.
For instance, the s<193>dhaka, by pleasing Bh<220>tin<200>, can get ç
plenty of food, clothing and ornaments as also wealth.
If the s<193>dhaka pleases Na<219><200>, she can become his servant-maid ç
and do his bidding.
Similarly K<193>me·var<200> makes him a king and Kum<193>rik<193> ç
bestows Kubera's wealth.
Then the text mentions the names of eight N<193>gin<200>s (another ç
class of female deities) and the results of their worship.
This is followed by ·avas<193>dhan<193> (repeating the given mantra, ç
sitting on a dead body, at dead of night on the new moon day) and ç
its result.
Then, the names of six Kinnar<200>s (another class of goddesses) and ç
thes<193>dhan<193>s connected with them are described.
Next comes the description of certain mantras and yantras (mystical ç
diagram) by which one can get protection against the dangers created ç
