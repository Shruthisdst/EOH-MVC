The Dev<200>m<193>h<193>tmya, also known as the Durg<193>sapta·at<200> ç
and the Ca<207><195><200>, is a pre-eminent work of the <185><193>ktatantras ç
or the Dev<200>-cult. (See <MS>DEV®M°H°TMYA <D>for details.) This ç
whole work of 700 verses is considered as a powerful mantra with specific ç
rules prescribed for its recitation, by which one can get whatever ç
result onewants.
One of the most important part of its recitation is the repitition ç
of the Nav<193>r<207>amantra†also called Nav<193>k<218>ar<200>† ç
since it has nava or nine ar<207>as or syllables.
The mantra is: ai<221> hr<200><221> kl<200><221> c<193>mu<207><195><193>yai ç
vicce.
The first three syllables represent Mah<193>sarasvat<200>, Mah<193>lak<218>m<200> ç
and Mah<193>k<193>l<200>, the three main aspects of the Divine Mother, ç
Durg<193>. They also represent the three states of Sat (eternal existence), ç
Cit (eternal consciousness) and °nanda (eternal bliss).
The word `vicce' consists of three parts: vit, ca, e. They represent ç
our physical, vital and mental states.
`C<193>mu<207><195><193>yai' means to `C<193>mu<207><195><193>'.
The total meaning of the mantra is `By the grace of the Mother C<193>mu<207><195><193>, ç
we are freed from the present condition of physical, vital and mental ç
states, and raised to the highest state of Sat-cit-<193>nanda.'
The word `Var<207>a' for letter, also means `colour'. It is said that ç
mantras have their own spectrums which can be perceived in inner contemplation. ç
Hence each letter of this mantra has to be contemplated in a definite ç
colour. They are:
@SPACE = 
@LEFT = 	aim	moon-like lustre.
@LEFT = 	hr<200>m	effulgence of the sun.
@LEFT = 	kl<200>m	blazing fire.
@LEFT = 	c<193>	shining golden colour.
@LEFT = 	mu<207>	deep red.
@LEFT = 	<195><193>	deep blue.
@LEFT = 	yai	black.
@LEFT = 	vi	white.

The japa of the Nav<193>r<207>amantra is always done as a part of ç
the recitation of the Durg<193>sapta·at<200>, though rarely, it ç
can be done independently also.
@NT = N<200>ti·ataka
@N1 = (`hundred  axioms  of  good conduct')
Subh<193><218>itas or S<220>ktis are a special class of Sanskrit literature ç
(See <MS>S<188>KTI-S°HITYA<D> under <MS>SANSKRIT LITERATURE<D>.). ç
They comprise the quintessence of human experience gathered over several ç
centuries. The N<200>ti·ataka of Bhart<216>hari (circa 100 <MS>B.C.<D>) ç
is one such work which is extremely popular even now. The legend goes ç
that he was the king of Ujjayin<200>. Being disgusted with the infidelity ç
of his queen, heabdicated the throne in favour of hisyounger brother ç
Vikram<193>ditya (the founder of the Vikrama·aka or the Sa<221>vat ç
era) and became a mendicant.
The work consists of 101 verses indifferent metres, divided into ç
ten paddhatis or topics.
A brief summary of the same may now be attempted here:
@S10N = 1.	M<220>rkhapaddhati†<R>ç
	`On Fools' (verses 3-11)
This section deals with wiseacres who are actually fools. It is impossible ç
to convince them since they feel they know everything. In the company ç
of the wise ones they are astute enough to keep mum so that their ç
ignorance is not revealed. Yet,  they  behave  shamelessly  before ç
others, and ultimately degrade themselves to the lowest levels.
@S10N = 2.	Vidvatpaddhati†<R>ç
	`On the Learned' (verses 12-21)
As opposed to the behaviour of the fools, this section describes the ç
characte-ristics of the learned and the wise. The language and the ç
content of their erudition is an ornament to the king and his kingdom ç
where they live. Hence, the kings should look upon them with great ç
respect and never belittle them. None can take away their `wealth' ç
called knowledge which is their best ornament. In fact it is vidy<193> ç
or knowledge that helps a person under all circumstances.
These wise ones know how to behave with different types of persons ç
and keep up their own dignity. People who come into contact with them ç
become learned, truthful and righteous.
@S10N = 3.	M<193>na·auryapaddhati†<R>ç
	`On Self-respect and Grit' (verses 22-31)
Men of great self-respect and grit are like lions. A lion even when ç
old and in a decrepit state will never stoop to eating grass to sustain ç
itself but will rather try to attack an elephant. Similarly these ç
heroic men of great self esteem will never demean themselves even ç
in times of dire calamities. And, they will never tolerate enemies ç
who try to dishonour or destroy them.
@S10N = 4.	Arthapaddhati†<R>ç
	`On Wealth' (verses 32-41)
Throughout the ages, a man of practical wisdom and common-sense has ç
realised the importance of money or wealth in one's personal and social ç
life. This is now being described in a language that is both elegant ç
and humorous. When a person has enough money, none of thequalities ç
that normally make him respectable in the eyes of the public†like ç
high caste, noble virtues, pedigree, or heroism †is necessary. People ç
praise him as a handsome man, as a man of learning, as virtuous and ç
as an orator. This shows that all good qualities are ultimately rooted ç
in money!
The author advises rich persons to enjoy their wealth as also distribute ç
it among the needy ones. Otherwise robbers may take it away!
@S10N = 5.	Durjanapaddhati†<R>ç
	``On the Wicked'' (verses 42-51)
This section describes the nature of positively evil persons, especially ç
the kings and hence how difficult it is to serve them.
The evil qualities normally seen in such persons are: cruelty, pugnacity, ç
greed for others' wealth, lack of sexual morality, jealousy and so ç
on.
Even if an evil person is endowed with learning or scholarship, he ç
has to be avoided like a poisonous snake.
It has become a habit for them to find fault with good people and ç
to criticise even their good qualities by distorting them.
Kings by nature, because of their position and power, are short-tempered. ç
Hence good persons have to be extremely careful in dealing with them.
Friendship with the evil ones is like the morning shadow, long in ç
the beginning and short later on, totally disappearing by midday. ç
Therefore it should be avoided.
@S10N = 6.	Sajjanapaddhati†<R>ç
	``On the Virtuous'' (verses 52-61)
This part of the book gives a long list of the several virtues or ç
good qualities that go to make a man really great. Some of these are: ç
friendship with the virtuous; humility before the elders and respected ç
persons; devotion to God; self-control; keeping away from the wicked; ç
courage in facing difficulties; heroism in war; great interest in ç
the acquisition of knowledge, especially of the scriptures; liberality ç
in giving gifts; absence of cruelty; decent behaviour towards women; ç
compassion towards the animals; expertise in the performance of one's ç
duties; absence of boasting about oneself; humility even when he becomes ç
rich; praising the virtues of others; ever eager to help others.
@S10N = 7.	Paropak<193>rapaddhati†<R>ç
	``On helping others'' (verses 62-71)
It is the very nature of great people to do good to others. They are ç
ever eager to do so. Trees bending low while laden with fruits, rain-bearing ç
clouds descending to the earth, sun and moon making the red and blue ç
lotuses to bloom†these natural phenomena have a lot to teachus.
Good people are ever eager to help others, never caring for themselves ç
whereas the evil ones go out of the way to harm others though they ç
have nothing to gain.
Incidentally, the poet gives a beautiful description of a true friend. ç
Heprevents you from committing sins, engages you in good actions, ç
protects your secrets, praises your virtues and never forsakes you ç
when you are in difficulties.
@S10N = 8.	Dhairyapaddhati†<R>ç
	``On Courage'' (verses 72-81)
The main theme of this part of the treatise is that men of mettle ç
will never give up an undertaking in the middle but will see through ç
it till the end.
Afraid of the obstacles that may arise, some people never start any ç
work. There are others who may start one but give it up in the middle ç
once they meet with obstacles. But the real heroes are they who will ç
undauntedly accomplish the task they take up in spite of being beset ç
with innumerable obstacles.
Another speciality of these people is that they never swerve from ç
the path of righteousness. They are above all temptations.
@S10N = 9.	Daivapaddhati†<R>ç
	``On the Power of Fate'' (verses 82-91)
In this section of the work, the author forcefully argues, with the ç
help of appropriate examples, that daiva or fate is all- powerful ç
in one's life and that pauru<218>a or human effort is useless! Perhaps ç
the bitter experiences of his own life are being reflected in these ç
verses.
The  following  are  some  of  the instances to the point: Indra and ç
the gods of heaven though endowed with all facilities, help and advantages, ç
were frequently defeated and driven out by the d<193>navas or demons. ç
Even the best of men created by Brahm<193> for the good of the world ç
die one day making his efforts null and void.
The death of a mouse that is seeking food, by falling into the mouth ç
of a hungry snake or of a bald-headed person seeking shelter under ç
a tree being killed by a falling object are other examples.
While advising people to surrender to Vidhi or fate, he also admires ç
the grit of great people who will never give up in spite of problems ç
and difficulties created by fate!
@S10N = 10.	Karmapaddhati†``On the Power of<R>ç
	Karma'' (verses 92-101)
Though Vidhi (or Brahm<193>) is very powerful, even he has to act ç
according to the karmaniyama or the theory of Karma, `As you sow, ç
so you reap'. In this last section the poet advises all to perform ç
good actions and avoid evil ones.
The language of the <185>ataka is compa-ratively simple and elegant. ç
Some printed editions contain 108 verses or 110 verses instead of ç
101. There are two Sanskrit commentaries by Mah<193>bala K<216><218><207>a·<193>stry ç
and M. R. K<193>le.
