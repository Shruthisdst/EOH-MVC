@NT = Belur Math Temple
Sv<193>m<200> Vivek<193>nanda (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1863-1902), with his ç
uncanny and incisive intellect, discovered that the best way to revitalise ç
the Hindu society, which had often lapsed into deep slumber, was to ç
rejuvenate its temples and monasteries. This could be better achieved ç
by building a model temple and a model monastery in which there would ç
be a balanced blend of the ancient and the modern values, both spiritual ç
and cultural. The result of this dream was the now well-known Belur ç
Math.
Belur Math is the main Monastery of the Ramakrishna Order built in ç
the small village of Belur in the Howrah District of West Bengal. ç
(The place has now become a big suburb of the Calcutta city [now known ç
as Kolkata].) Apart from an impressive temple of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1836-1886), the monastery houses the Head quarters ç
of the Ramakrishna Order with  its  twin  organisations  of  the Ramakrishna ç
Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. Other buildings include three smaller ç
shrines†dedicated to S<193>rad<193> Dev<200>, Sv<193>m<200> Vivek<193>nanda ç
and Sv<193>m<200> Brahm<193>-nanda†residential quarters of the monastic ç
members, a museum, a dispensary as also guest houses.
The temple of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a is the pivot of the whole ç
campus.
In one of his conversations, Vivek<193>-nanda gives his description ç
of the temple of his vision thus: `In the building of this prospective ç
temple and Math, I have the desire to bring together all that is best ç
in Eastern and Western art...The Rama-krishna Temple and Prayer-hall ç
should be built together....Within the temple there would be a figure ç
of <185>r<200> R<193>mak<216><218><207>a seated on the swan'. (The ç
Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Vol.<MS> VII<D>. pp. 204-205.)
@SPACE1 = 
Vivek<193>nanda entrusted the task to Vij<210><193>n<193>nanda (<MS>A.<|>D. ç
<D>1868-1938), another disciple of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, who ç
was a qualified engineer.
@SPACE1 = 
Incorporating Vivek<193>nanda's concepts as far as possible, Vij<210><193>n<193>nanda ç
prepared three plans of the proposed temple, with the help of Mr. ç
Gyther (Government Architect). One of them is said to have been approved ç
by him.
@SPACE1 = 
However, due to the sudden demise of Vivek<193>nanda as also paucity ç
of funds, the temple project had to be kept in cold storage for quite ç
a few years.
@SPACE1 = 
Later on, the plan was revived and the foundation stone was laid by ç
Vij<210><193>n<193>-nanda himself on the 16th May 1935. When it was ç
completed, he consecrated it on the 14th January 1938.
@SPACE1 = 
The whole plan had been prepared by Martin Burn and Company, the famous ç
architects of the day.
@SPACE1 = 
The temple, built mainly in sandstone, contains the architectural ç
features of several styles. The facade is massive and impressive. ç
At the back is the garbhamandir (sanctum) with one main dome and eleven ç
subsidiary ones.
The whole temple has been built on a platform 1.75 meters (5.8 ft.) ç
high, the length and the width being 70.5 metres (235 ft.) and 42 ç
meters (140 ft.).
The superstructure is 61 metres (202ft.) long and 24 metres (80ft.) ç
wide. The pinnacle of the central dome is 33metres (110 ft.) from ç
the ground level.
The  garbhamandir  is  a  square measuring 8 metres (26 ft.). The ç
n<193><219>mandir (navara<209>ga or congregational hall) is 31 metres ç
(103 ft.) by 12 metres (41 ft.).
The beautiful marble image of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a is about 1 ç
metre (3.5 ft.) high, mounted on a pedestal of 0.8 metre (2<F21W1>'<F255D>8<F21W1>"<F255D>) ç
height.
The daily rituals in the temple are: ma<209>gal<193>rati (waving of ç
light in the early morning); p<220>j<193> (ritualistic worship); bhoga ç
or naivedya (food offerings); vesper service with music.
The  following  are  the  festivals observed in this temple: Birthdays ç
of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, S<193>rad<193>dev<200>, Vivek<193>nanda ç
and of other sa<221>ny<193>sin disciples of R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a; ç
jayant<200>s of <185>a<209>kar<193>c<193>ya, Buddha and <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a ç
Caitanya; R<193>manavam<200>; <185>r<200>K<216><218><207>a-janm<193><218><219>am<200>; ç
Gurup<220>r<207>im<193>; Phalah<193>ri<207><200> K<193>l<200>p<220>j<193>; ç
Sn<193>nay<193>tr<193>; Ga<209>g<193>-p<220>j<193>; Durg<193>p<220>j<193>; ç
K<193>l<200>p<220>j<193>; Sarasvat<200>p<220>j<193> (on Vasantapa<210>cam<200>) ç
and Mah<193>·ivar<193>tri.
Out of these, the Durg<193>p<220>j<193> (in image), started by Vivek<193>nanda ç
himself, is celebrated in an elaborate and grand manner. Kum<193>r<200>p<220>j<193> ç
(worshipping a small girl as the Divine Mother) is one of the special ç
attractions during this celebration.
With its harmonious combination of several architectural features ç
incorporated in the building and the spirit of harmony of  religions  as  personified  in  the ç
snow-white marble image of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a permeating the ç
atmosphere, this unique temple at Belur Math has now become a centre ç
of universal attraction for all the pilgrims in the path of spiritual ç
progress.
@NT = Bh<193>gyas<220>kta
@N1 = (`hymn [requesting for] wealth and well-being')
It is but natural for every human being to desire for wealth and well-being ç
in this world. When he finds that he cannot get what he wants by his ç
limited efforts alone, he may be tempted to tryunethical means. Intuiting ç
such a possibility, our <216><218>is have provided the aspirants with ç
appropriate prayers to God to get what they want. The Bh<193>gyas<220>kta ç
may be classed among such prayers.
It occurs in two places: The <184>gveda (7.3.41) and the Taittir<200>ya ç
Br<193>hma<207>a (2.8.9).
According to the <184>gvedic version, Vasi<218><219>ha is the <216><218>i ç
(the sage to whom it was revealed) and Bhaga is the chief devat<193> ç
or deity. The chandas or metre is jagat<200> and tri<218><219>ubh.
A brief summary of its contents may now be attempted here:
We invoke the various Vedic gods like Agni, Indra, Bhaga, Mitra, Varu<207>a, ç
Rudra and others at this hour of dawn.
(Bhaga is the chief deity of this s<220>kta. He is the giver or distributor ç
of all the good things of life.)
One who wants wealth<192>whether heis poor or even a king†can pray ç
for it from Bhaga, the powerful sustainer of thi<%20>s<%0>world<%-19>.<%0>
O Bhaga! You, the possessor of true wealth, listen to our prayer and ç
grant us boons in the form of cattle, horses, children and relatives.
May we have Bhaga for our lord, at all times of day.
O gods! May Bhaga only be the possessor of opulence. O Bhaga, who ç
is invoked by all, you be our guide.
May the gods U<218>as (deities of dawn), bring Bhaga, the giver of ç
wealth, to us for our sacrifice.
May the auspicious gods of dawn who give rains, bless us with horses, ç
cows, and heroic sons.
The <184>gvidh<193>na (2.25) of <185>aunaka (circa 500 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) ç
declares that those who are suffering from diseases as also those ç
who want to enter a new house, should repeat this s<220>kta as a prayer.
Some texts have an extra verse at the end. Its meaning is†`O Agni! ç
One who wants me to be deprived of wealth, you please deprive him ç
of his wealth!'

@NT = Bharat Sevashram Sangha
This is an organisation of Hindu monks established with the twin ideals ç
of empowering the Hindu society and conduct social service activities. ç
It was established by Sv<193>m<200> Pra<207>av<193>nanda (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1896-1941) in 1927.
He was born in Bajitpur (now in Bangladesh) in 1896. As a young man ç
he was extraordinarily strong. A strict vegetarian, he cultivated ç
the habit of meditation right from an early age. At the ageof 17, ç
he became a disciple of B<193>b<193> Gambh<200>r-n<193>thj<200> and ç
practised severe austerities for five years. He received sa<221>ny<193>sa ç
at the age of 28 from Sv<193>m<200> Govind<193>nanda Giri. He gradually ç
evolved a monastic training programme to be spread over 12 to 14 years.
After setting up a few mobile preaching units in 1924, he officially ç
formed the Bharat Sevashram Sangha†BSS for short †in 1927 with his ç
sa<221>ny<193>sin disciples as the trustees led by him. Moral and ç
spiritual regeneration of the Hindu society with special emphasis ç
on physical education was an important aspect of its work.
Famine relief work, disaster relief, eradication of untouchability, ç
uniting the depressed classes of the Hindu society and bringing them ç
into the main stream are some of the other programmes of work undertaken ç
by the organisation. Interdining is one of the methods adopted, especially ç
in the rural areas.
Organising Village Defence Units of young men to protect the Hindus ç
during communal riots is also an important contribution of this organisation.
Apart from enlisting eligible persons for sa<221>ny<193>sa, a system ç
of spiritual initiation for householder devotees has also been evolved. ç
This is normally done by senior monks duly authorised by the organisation.
The founder started in 1935, Hindu Milan Mandirs which act as religious ç
meeting places for all Hindus, without any distinction of caste or ç
creed. For all practical purposes they can be considered as the branches ç
of the organisation.
Serious efforts have also been made to reconvert the Hindus who have ç
left their mother religion, with appropriate religious ceremonies.
At present, the organisation has 500 monks, 100 <193>·ramas, 450 Milan ç
Mandirs and a large number of service activities. It has also many ç
branches in foreign countries.
@NT = Bh<220>ta<195><193>mara Tantra
This is a small work belonging to the V<193>m<193>c<193>ra tantra ç
group.
`Bh<220>ta' means any `living being'. `£<193>mara' means `terrible.' ç
Hence Bh<220>ta-<195><193>mara Tantra means a work that can strike ç
terror in the hearts of those beings against whom it may be used.
It has sixteen pa<219>alas or chapters and 284 verses. This number, ç
however, is deceptive, since several verses have 10 to 20 lines!
The contents may be briefly stated as follows:
Process of killing and reviving a person (m<193>ra<207>a and sa<210>j<200>vana); ç
method of pleasing the goddess who lives in cremation grounds (sma·<193>nav<193>sin<200>); ç
mantras of deities like Ca<207><195>ak<193>ty<193>yan<200> and Krodhapati; ç
mantras and rites that help the s<193>dhaka to bring certain spirit-deities ç
like Ce<219>ik<193> and Bh<220>tin<200> under control; mantras by ç
which even gods like Indra, Vi<218><207>u and Mahe·vara can be eliminated; ç
mantras of eight Yak<218>i<207><200>s like Surasundar<200>, Kanaka-vat<200> ç
and others who, when pleased, will fulfil all the desires of the s<193>dhakas.
@NT = Bihu
This is the biggest festival of Assam. This word is probably derived ç
from the Sanskrit word Vi<218>uvat. Though three Bihus are celebrated, ç
the Bah<193>g Bihu (or Bohag Bihu), also called Sout (or Caitra) ç
which comes in the spring season†April †is the biggest of the three ç
festivals. It falls on the last day of Caitra. This is celebrated ç
over seven days. The first day is reserved for the worship and special ç
care of the cattle. The second is a day of big feast for friends and ç
relatives. On this day it is usual to patch up differences by social ç
calls. The tribals celebrate it with special songs and dance, called ç
Husari Bihuna. Next in importance is M<193>gh Bihu, also called ç
Bhog<193>l<200> Bihu, celebrated on the last day of Pu<218>ya and ç
the first day of M<193>gha. Piling up firewood to form a temple-like ç
structure (called meji) and setting fire to it is an important part ç
of this festival. The whole day is spent in feasting. Last comes the ç
Ka<219><219>i Bihu or K<193><209>g<193>li Bihu in autumn (in K<193>rtt<200>ka). ç
Aspecial feature of this celebration is the worship of the tulas<200> ç
(basil) plant and placing of lighted lamps at its base. A`sky lamp' ç
is hung over a high bamboo pole, not only to light up one's yard, ç
but also to guide the dead to the next world!
@NT = Brahmakum<193>r<200>s
A handful of men and women living in Hyderabad (in Sind, now in Pakistan) ç
started a group, `Om Ma<207><195>ali' by name, for spiritual studies ç
and meditation in <MS>A.D.<D>1935. One year later, it was shifted ç
to Karachi where it continued up to <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1950.
Dada Lekhraj Kriplani (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1876-1969) a respected and wealthy ç
member of this community, started experiencing a series of visions ç
in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1936 which transformed his life. He wound up his ç
jewellery business and dedicated the rest of his life for spiritual ç
pursuits.
He came to be known as Brahma B<193>b<193> among his followers.
In <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1937, he formed a Managing Committee of eight young ç
women and in the next year, he surrendered all his property to a Trust ç
administered by them.
These ladies came to be known as Brahmakum<193>r<200>s and became ç
the progenitors of the movement in that name. Though this is primarily ç
run by women, men  too  (known  as  Brahmakum<193>ras) participate ç
in its activities.
The community shifted to Mount Abu (in Rajasthan, India) in <MS>A.<|>D.<D>1950 ç
and built its Head Quarters there. Its official name is ``Brahma Kumaris' ç
World Spiritual University'' (BKWSU). It is managed by the Administrative ç
Head, a Governing Board and a Management Committee.
At the Headquarters there are three campuses: Madhuban, Gyan Sarovar ç
and Shantivan. There is also a recreational park and the Global Hospital ç
and Research Centre.
These  Campuses  have  several buildings including auditoria and living ç
quarters.
Meditation techniques called R<193>ja Yoga are taught in this institution.
The  organisation  claims  to  have several centres in India and abroad.
@NT = Brahmaputra
@N1 = (`son of Brahm<193>')
The Brahmaputra is one of the major rivers of India.
There are two mythological accounts about its origin: Amogh<193>, ç
the wife of the sage <185><193>ntanu conceived by the grace of Brahm<193> ç
the creator and gave birth to a son. He was named as `Brahmaputra'. ç
He was placed in the midst of four mountains by his father. He then ç
assumed the form of a large mass of water where gods and heavenly ç
maidens started taking bath. Itcame to be known as `Brahmaku<207><195>a'. ç
It then started flowing as a river.
When Para·ur<193>ma was ordered by his father Jamadagni to kill his ç
own mother, he executed it with his axe. Since it was a heinous act, ç
the axe got stuck in his hand. To get it out, he started on a pilgrimage. ç
When he came to the small lake, now known as Para·ur<193>maku<207><195>a ç
(25kms. [15 miles] to the north of Teza in the Lomita district of ç
Arunachal Pradesh), he broke one of the hills surrounding it to release ç
the water for the benefit of mankind. This became the river Brahmaputra ç
and the axe came out there by indicating that he was absolved of the ç
sin.
Brahmaputra originates in south-western Tibet, and is called Yarlung ç
or Tsangpo. After flowing for 1300 kms. (800miles) it bends to the ç
south and enters India. For some distance it is called the Siang river. ç
It falls to the plains at Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh. It is interesting ç
to note that it changes colour here, every half an hour. As the river ç
Dibang and Lohit join it, it acquires the name Brahmaputra and enters ç
Assam. Passing through the towns of Dibrugarh, Nehamati, Tezim and ç
Guwahati, it finally joins the Padm<193> river, the easternmost branch ç
of the Ga<209>g<193>. This combined stream flows into Bangladesh where ç
it joins the river Meghan<193>. It then empties into the Bay of Bengal. ç
The total length of the river is 2,850 kms. (1800 miles). The average ç
depth of the river is 38 meters (124 ft.), the maximum being 120 metres ç
(380 ft.).
The Brahmaputra valley is associated with lores from the Mah<193>bh<193>rata ç
as also with <185>aivite traditions.
The famous K<193>m<193>khya temple is situated on its bank, about ç
2 kms. away, near Guwahati. The banks of this river are dotted with ç
dense forests and tribal settlements.
During monsoon, floods are very common.
The river is mainly used for transpor- tation and navigation.
@NT = Bull Temple
Any devotee visiting a temple of <185>iva will not miss seeing a reclining ç
bull facing the <185>ivali<209>ga. It is the V<193>hana or mount of ç
Lord <185>iva.
In the pur<193><207>as as also in the icono-graphical works, it is ç
called `Nandi' (See<MS>NANDI<D> for details.) or Nandike·vara.
Nandi is always sculptured as a reclining bull whereas Nandike·vara ç
is shown in a human form with the head of a bull.
Temples dedicated only to Nandi are very rare. There is one such in ç
the Basavanagudi area of Bangalore (now Bengaluru).
This temple is said to have been builtby Kempegowda (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1513-1569) a chieftain under the rulers of Vijayanagara empire, in ç
the year <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1537.
It is perched on the top of a small hillock called the Bugle Rock.
The giant image made of a single granite block, is 5 metres (16.5 ç
ft.) in height and 6 metres (20 ft.) in length.
Initially grey in colour, it has become black over the years, due ç
to the devotees applying coconut oil.
A small rivulet, Vi·vabh<193>rat<200>, is believed to originate from ç
the feet of this bull.
According to the local legend, a `divine' bull used to eat away the ç
entire crop of groundnuts in the nearby area. To pacify this bull, ç
a temple was constructed.
It is said that this stone image of the bull started growing bigger ç
and bigger. As per the advice received from Lord <185>iva himself, ç
the devotees placed a tri·<220>la (trident) on its forehead, thereby ç
stopping its growth.
Behind this enormous image, there is a <185>ivali<209>ga which might ç
have been a later addition.
The major festival of this temple called `Ka<195>alek<193>yi-pari<218>e' ç
(`Groundnut-fair'), falls on the last Monday and Tuesday of the month ç
of K<193>rttika, usually in November. The farmers offer their first ç
harvest of ground-nuts to the Nandi, followed by a fair (village market).
There is an ancient temple of Ga<207>e·a, with a huge image nearby.
