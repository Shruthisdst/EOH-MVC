The Camakapra·na is, if we can use the expression, a `twin' of the ç
Rudrapra·na (See <MS>RUDRAPRA<185>NA<D>.). The two always go together, ç
especially in Vedic rituals.
It occurs in the 4th k<193><207><195>a (book) ofthe 7th prap<193><219>haka ç
(section) of the Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193>.
In culmination of the Vedic rites described in the six earlier prap<193><219>hakas, ç
<193>jya (ghee) has to be poured in a ladle made  of  audumbara  wood  (Ficus ç
glomerata)†the common fig tree†in a continuous  stream,  technically  called ç
`vasor- dh<193>r<193>' (same as p<220>r<207><193>huti in homas). For ç
this purpose the entire Camaka (in eleven anuv<193>kas or mantras) ç
has to be used.
The term Camaka has been used for this piece since the words `ca ç
me' (`and for me') occur repeatedly.<R>ç

The  whole  mantra  is  a  prayer addressed to God requesting him ç
to grant the various objects of life (347 in number!) here and now ç
which will make a man happy and be useful in yaj<210>a or sacrifice.
The following are some of the objects of desire asked for: food; health ç
and strength of body; eminence and fame; balance of mind; wealth; ç
love and good-will towards the world; food and drink to maintain the ç
body in good condition; plenty of food materials; earth and its treasures; ç
favour of Vedic gods, especially of Indra; various implements of sacrifice; ç
the facility to conduct Vedic sacrifices.
The tenth anuv<193>ka is a great dedicatory prayer.
The last anuv<193>ka ends by asking fornever-ending food, sacrifices ç
to be performed, sun and rains and a prayer to the all-pervading God.
