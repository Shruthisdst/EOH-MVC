@SB8.5 = General Introduction
If the estimate of the excellence of a civilization and culture depends ç
upon the degree of excellence of its women, then, the women of the ç
Vedic age and the epic period prove it beyond all doubt.
The knowledge of Brahman of V<193>g<193><221>-bh<216><207><200> (<184>gveda ç
10.125.1-8), the intellectualism of G<193>rg<200> V<193>caknav<200> ç
(B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka Upani<218>ad 3.6.1), the yogic mysticism ç
of Sulabh<193> (Mah<193>bh<193>rata, <185><193>ntiparva 320), ç
the scholarship of Arundhat<200> who was an <193>c<193>ry<193> (teacher) ç
in her own right (Mah<193>-bh<193>rata, Anu·<193>sanaparva, 130), ç
the wifely devotedness of S<193>vitr<200> (Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
Vanaparva 297), the consummate chastity of Anas<220>y<193> (Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
°diparva 65) and the perfect personification of all the great womanly ç
virtues called S<200>t<193> (R<193>m<193>ya<207>a)†these are the ç
unique qualities of the all-time great women of India who have shown ç
by their life and example, to what glorious heights women can rise.
@SB8.5 = Basic Hindu Attitude
This could happen only because Ved<193>nta, the quintessence of Hindu ç
scriptures, has declared in unequivocal terms that man and woman are ç
two aspects of one and the same divinity (vide <185>vet<193>-·vatara ç
Upani<218>ad 4.3; B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka Upani<218>ad 1.4.3). ç
Hence, both have the same capacity to realise that divinity. Consequently, ç
they should be given equal opportunities to do so. This is established ç
by the examples of Maitrey<200> as a seeker of Truth (vide B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka ç
Upani<218>ad 2.4.3-5) and V<193>g<193>mbh<216><207><200> as a perfected ç
soul (vide <184>gveda 10.125).
One more basic factor has to be remembered here. Both man and woman† ç
nay, even every living being in the universe†are, in their essential ç
nature, the <193>tman, the soul, which is immortal and pure consciousness. ç
For a bound soul (the j<200>va) birth as a man or as a woman depends ç
on its karma. The same j<200>va is sometimes born in a male body and ç
sometimes in a female.
Since the ancient Hindu sages kept these basic facts in mind always, ç
women were given full freedom to pursue any goal of life, here or ç
hereafter.
@SB8.5 = Hindu Woman through the Ages
@S10 = 1.	A Brief Survey
This is amply proved if we course through the Hindu scriptures of ç
the early periods.
In the <184>gveda itself about thirty women sages like Vi·vav<193>r<193> ç
(5.28), Ap<193>l<193> (8.91) and Gho<218><193> K<193>k<218><200>vat<200> ç
(10.39) have been mentioned as the seers of hymns.
Girls who underwent the upanayana sacrament and studied the Vedas ç
either in the gurukula (house of the guru) or at home were known as ç
brahmav<193>din<200>s. The sadyovadh<220>s were those girls who did ç
not study the Vedas but were straight-away given in marriage. But ç
even these girls underwent the upanayana sacrament just before marriage.
The tradition of sending the girls tothe gurukulas seems to have ç
been gradually given up, the responsibility of educating them being ç
taken over by the father or other elder men of the family.
Even during the epic period, women could undergo upanayana ceremony, ç
study the Vedas and be teachers of the Vedas. This tradition probably ç
disappeared by the time of the Manusm<216>ti (200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>).
By the time of the sm<216>tis and thedharma·<193>stras, there was ç
a gradual decline in the status of women, who were even bracketed ç
with the ·<220>dras, shorn of all the earlier privileges. Social upheavals ç
brought about by frequent invasions by foreign marauders might have ç
contributed to this development.
It is a matter of great pride and satisfaction that even during these ç
dark middle ages (from <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 900) many eminent women of literary ç
fame like Ketal<193>dev<200> (12th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>), military ç
generals likeN<193>yak<193>dev<200> (of Gujarat, <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1158), ç
administrators like Ahaly<193>ba<200> Ho<202>kar, (<MS>A.D.<D> 1735-1795) ç
and saints like M<200>r<193>b<193><200> (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1547-1614) ç
appeared on the country's horizon keeping the ancient spirit of India ç
alive.
With the advent of political freedom and reform movements within Hinduism ç
the condition and status of women have improved a lot.
@S10 = 2.	A Bird's Eye View of the<R>ç
	Social Structure
Over the centuries, the position and status of women has seen several ç
changes.
During the Vedic and the epic ages, they had access to good education ç
and the freedom†as adults†to choose their husbands. As wives and mothers, ç
they had a respectable place in the Vedic sacrifices and religious ç
rites, though rarely, they had  the  freedom  and  opportunity  to ç
remainunmarried and devote themselves to spiritual pursuits.
However, the insecurity brought about by the frequent foreign invasions ç
forced the Hindu society to subject women to many restrictions, practically ç
confining them to the four walls of the home,whether parental or ç
those of their husbands.
Pre-puberty marriages culminating ultimately in ridiculous child-marriages ç
was one of the evil results, of this restric- tion. As a corollary ç
arose the problem of child-widows who had to lead a wretched life ç
for the rest of their lives slaving for others. Attempts to introduce ç
remarriage of such widows by social reformers like ®·varacandra Vidy<193>s<193>gara ç
(<MS>A.D.<D> 1820-1891) were not very successful.
As for adult widows, including those with children, healthy restrictions ç
were imposed, in consonance with the Hindu philosophy of life. They ç
were expected to lead an austere life similar to that of sa<221>ny<193>sins. ç
Tonsure of widows existed only in a small section of orthodox br<193>hma<207>as ç
in South India. Even this has disappeared now.
@SPACE1 = 
Remarriage of married women was permitted under certain special conditions ç
like the death of the husband before consummation, the husband missing ç
for a long time or taking sa<221>ny<193>sa (monastic life).
Since marriage was considered a sacrament and a life-long bond, its ç
dissolution†or divorce†was unknown.
Though eight forms of marriage had been mentioned by the dharma·<193>str<193>s, ç
only  the  first  four†br<193>hma,  daiva, <193>r<218>a and pr<193>j<193>patya ç
(See <MS>VIV°HA<D> for details.)†were recognised as legal.
While the wife was expected to preserve her chastity at any cost and ç
be devoted to her husband, the husband was required to treat her with ç
love, consideration and respect. She too had an important role to ç
play in religious rites.
The place of the mother in the family was supreme. By declaring her ç
to be far superior even to the father (vide Manu-sm<216>ti 2.145), ç
she was raised to the status of a goddess. Her curse could never be ç
averted. Even a sa<221>ny<193>sin (monk) had to bow down before his ç
mother whereas all others, including his father had to pay obeisance ç
to him!
The Sat<200> system, where the widow sacrificed her life on the funeral ç
pyre of her dead husband was optional and was confined mostly to the ç
princely class. It was never encouraged, though during a certain period ç
(in the 18th century Bengal) most inhuman widow burnings did take ç
place.
This was successfully eliminated by the efforts of enlightened leaders ç
like R<193>j<193> R<193>mmohan Roy (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1772-1838).
@SPACE1 = 
Mention should also be made here of the practice of jauhar by the ç
women of R<193>japut<193>na. It is a type of self-immolation resorted ç
to by them to escape capture, molestation, captivity or slavery, as ç
a last resort, during war, when defeat was certain. These women dressed ç
themselves well, took the blessings of the elders, came in a procession ç
and fell into a huge blazing fire, sacrificing their lives. For them ç
their honour as women was more valuable than even their own lives. ç
This has shown to what great heights Hindu womanhood could rise in ç
periods of national disaster. Historians have recorded at least three ç
such jauhars at Chittor (in Rajasthan) during <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1303, ç
1534 and 1568.
Another social practice which gradually deteriorated into a social ç
evil was the devad<193>s<200> system. Originally, unmarried girls ç
were dedicated to a local deity in a temple. They lived with their ç
parents and served as the handmaids of the gods through dancing and ç
singing on special occasions until they were married. Whenthis `marriage' ç
to the deity became a permanent affair, it gave rise to concubinage ç
and prostitution. Vigorous efforts by social reformers have practically ç
eliminated this system but for some remnants in South India.
Up to the pre-independence days women did not have rights over the ç
properties of their fathers. Their control over that of their husbands†even ç
after their death†was very limited. However the laws by the Indian ç
Parliament during the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1954-1956 have brought ç
about  revolutionary  changes  in  their favour.
@SPACE1 = 
A few other customs also may be mentioned here: The practice of niyoga ç
or levirate was abandoned long back and was declared sinful in the ç
Kaliyuga or Iron Age. The purdah system†women wearing veils to cover ç
their faces†existed only in the royal and very rich families, that ç
too in North India, probably due to the influence of Islamic culture. ç
Even for serious crimes committed by women, the punishment or expiation ç
was less severe. Death penalty was practically unknown. Women raped ç
were never to be abandoned but taken back after expiations and purificatory ç
rites.
The wife of the head of the family was the matron of the home. As ç
regards the de·<193>c<193>ras†local religious customs† not specifically ç
mentioned in the religious works, she and other elderly ladies of ç
the family had to be consulted.
@SB8.5 = In the Modern Context
Political freedom of India has brought about political unity of the ç
whole country. However, partition has also had its tragic effects. ç
As a result of these two simultaneous phenomena the life pattern of ç
Hindu women has changed profoundly over the last fifty years than ç
over several centuries.
Normally, it is the educated middle class that shapes the cultural ç
life of a society. Hindu women of this class had been, for ages, holding ç
on to their values and ways of life†good or not-so-good† with great ç
tenacity. But, the sudden social upheavals due to the partition as ç
also the newfound freedom gradually unshackled them, making them venture ç
into many new fields of life, formerly thought to be the prerogatives ç
of men only.
Now they are able to receive good education in any field and get suitable ç
jobs to earn their own money thereby increasing their standard of ç
living, without depending on the men-folk of the family. This has ç
contributed to their self-confidence and boldness in public life. ç
It is not uncommon to see qualified and able women even in the fields ç
of government administration, law-courts, police and armed forces, ç
in business houses and in institutions of higher education.
These employment opportunities have had a very healthy effect on the ç
widows with young children to take care of. They can now keep their ç
independence and dignity.
Women now have equal rights of inheritance over the properties of ç
their fathers and husbands.
Polygamy which existed for millennia has been abolished and monogamy ç
has been enforced. Divorce is easier and is allowed to both the sexes. ç
Age of marriage for girls has been raised to 18 (plus). However, women ç
are generally marrying late, after the age of 20 or more.
Women are also exercising the option of remaining single or join the ç
monastic organisations  (for  women)  which  was almost unheard of ç
in the earlier days.
However, in their hurry to become `modern', they seem to be falling ç
a prey† like men†to imitate the Western culture to the detriment of ç
the time-tested Hindu values of life. The ancient and eternal ideal ç
of the perfect wifehood and the perfect motherhood†as demonstrated ç
in the life of S<193>rad<193>dev<200> (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1853-1920), the ç
divine spouse of the Paramaha<221>sa R<193>mak<216><218><207>a (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1836-1886)†seems to be slowly fading. This does not augur well for ç
the Hindu society. The earlier the Hindu women wake up to this danger, ç
the better.
