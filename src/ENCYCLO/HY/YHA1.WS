Y<193>davaprak<193>·a was a reputed teacher of Advaita Ved<193>nta ç
under whom R<193>m<193>nuja (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1017-1137) studied for ç
some time. Since R<193>m<193>nuja's genius did not accept the dry ç
interpretation of the Upani<218>ads sans bhakti or devotion to God, ç
differences arose between them. According to one view, Y<193>davaprak<193>·a ç
had planned to get R<193>m<193>nuja drowned in the Ga<209>g<193> river ç
during a pilgrimage, but he managed to escape. Later on, it is said, ç
Y<193>davaprak<193>·a became a disciple of R<193>m<193>nuja under ç
the baptismal name Govindad<193>sa. The book Yatidharmasamuccaya ç

@SPACE = 
This is a special concept given by the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (3.10-16).
In the beginning God created the human beings, the gods in heaven ç
as also yaj<210>a†the system of sacrifice and worship †as the link ç
between them. The human beings were advised to worship the godsthrough ç
yaj<210>a; and, the gods would respond by giving them what they want ç
or need to lead a happy life. It is by such mutual help and co-operation ç
that both can be satisfied.
This is then followed by a description of how the whole creation is ç
sustained by an interlinking of various factors, as follows: Living ç
beings are produced by food. Food is produced by rains. Rains are ç
induced by the unseen but positive result of yaj<210>as performed ç
by the human beings. Yaj<210>a is brought about by the physical and ç
ritual activity of the priests as also the performer of the sacrifice. ç
The basis for the sacrificial system is the Veda. And, the Veda has ç
emerged out of Ak<218>ara or Param<193>tman, the Supreme God.
This in sum is the jagat-cakra or yaj<210>acakra, since the Veda is ç
primarily concerned with yaj<210>a or sacrifice.

This Yaj<210>am<220>rti or Yaj<210>apuru<218>a is described as having ç
three heads, three legs, seven hands and four horns. His body is red ç
in colour and wears a vanam<193>l<193> (garland of wild flowers). ç
Apart from exhibiting the postures of protection and bestowal of boons ç
(abhaya and varada mudr<193>s) he holds several implements of sacrifice ç
like the sruk and sruva (ladles).
Obviously this is a symbolic representation of a sacrifice.
@NT = Y<193>j<210>avalkya
Y<193>j<210>avalkya was one of the wisest and the most illustrious ç
among the Vedic sages. He was the son of the sage Brahmar<193>ta and ç
a nephew as also adisciple of Vai·amp<193>yana. Once he incurred ç
the wrath of his guru and was expelled by him, after surrendering ç
the Veda (Yajurveda) to him. Later he pleased S<220>rya (the Sun-god) ç
and got a new Veda, which came to be known as the <185>ukla Yajurveda ç
or V<193>jasaney<200> Sa<221>hit<193>. (See <MS>YAJURVEDA<D> for ç
details.)
In the scholarly debates on Brahman arranged by the king Janaka Vaideha, ç
heemerged as the best and the most brilliant of all the scholarly ç
<216><218>is (vide B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka Upani<218>ad 3rd Chapter).
He taught spiritual wisdom to his first wife Maitrey<200> who was ç
a seeker of truth. His second wife K<193>ty<193>yan<200> was not interested ç
in it.
Two more works are attributed to him: Yogay<193>j<210>avalkya and ç
Y<193>j<210>avalkya Sm<216>ti.
@NT = Y<193>j<210>avalkya Sm<216>ti
This is a well-known sm<216>ti belonging to the classical dharma·<193>stra ç

It is said to be a composition of the famous sage Y<193>j<210>avalkya, ç
the promulgator of the <185>ukla Yajurveda Sa<221>hit<193>. Its ç
style and ideas seem to be close to this Veda. The present edition ç

theoriginal might be placed between 100<MS>B.<|>C.<D> and <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç

It has 1010 verses in the classical anu<218><219>ubh meter and has ç
five standard commentaries by Apar<193>rka (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1200), Mitrami·ra ç

The Var<193>ha or Boar-incarnation is the third in the series of ten ç
incarnations (See <MS>DA<185>°VAT°RAS<D>.) Sometimes, this form is ç
associated with the origin of yaj<210>as or Vedic sacrifices in all ç
their details.
The P<193><210>car<193>tra texts like the S<193>tvata Sa<221>hit<193> ç
(12.44.49) include Yaj<210>avar<193>ha among the 38 vibh<193>vat<193>ras ç
(glorious manifestations) of Vi<218><207>u.
This representation is highly symbolical. The legs of Yaj<210>avar<193>ha ç
represent the four Vedas, and the tusk the sacrificial altar. The ç
face stands for all sacrifices, the tongue for fire and the hair for ç
thesacred darbha grass. The two eyes symbolise  day  and  night.  The  snout ç
denotes all the offerings and oblations whereas the grunt stands for ç
the s<193>man (vide Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a 1.4.32-34).

The Yajurveda is the second of thefour Vedas, the basic scriptures ç
of Hinduism. It is said to have emerged out of the southern face of ç
Brahm<193>, the creator. It is also called Adhvaryuveda, since its ç
main use is in the performance of  the  Vedic  sacrifices  wherein  the ç
adhvaryu is the chief priest under whose direct guidance the entire ç
sacrifice is performed. Its mantras are called yajus which are in ç
prose.
Since the ancient times, it has been available in two main streams, ç
the K<216><218><207>a Yajurveda and the <185>ukla Yajurveda.
The popular legend that describes how this came about runs as follows: ç
The sage Vai·amp<193>yana, to whom Vedavy<193>sa had imparted the ç
Yajurveda, once incurred the sin of brahmahaty<193> (the sin of ç
killing a br<193>hma<207>a) due to a serious but technical lapse. ç
Being too old and decrepit to perform the prescribed expiation, he ç
asked his disciples to do it on his behalf which was permitted by ç
the relevant scriptures. Y<193>j<210>avalkya, his best disciple, probably ç
due to the pride of his learning, offered to do it all by himself ç
thereby slighting the  other  disciples.  Angered  by  this behaviour ç
of his, Vai·amp<193>yana ordered him to give back the Veda he had ç
taught and quit.
Y<193>j<210>avalkya then `vomitted' the Veda which was black or dark ç
in colour, and left. The other disciples took the form of tittiri ç
birds (partridges) and consumed it. Since it was dark in colour, it ç
came tobe known as K<216><218><207>a Yajurveda (k<216><218><207>a ç
= dark, black). Since the tittiri birds consumed it, it was also called ç
Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193>.
Y<193>j<210>avalkya later worshipped the Sun-god and got another version ç
of the same Veda from him, who taught it assuming the form of a horse. ç
Hence this branch came to be known as <185>ukla Yajurveda (·ukla ç
= white, bright) and V<193>jasaney<200> Sa<221>hit<193> (v<193>ji ç
= horse).
Obviously  this  legend  is  highly symbolical which has to be unravelled ç
carefully.
The  following  is  one  plausible explanation: Y<193>j<210>avalkya ç
being the most brilliant of all the students of Vai·am-p<193>yana, ç
had mastered the whole of the Yajurveda. He was now forced to ç
teach it to the other disciples. To the extent he taught it to them ç
and to the extent they learnt it, that part of the Veda slipped out ç
of his memory due to the curse of his guru. After thus losing it, ç
he had to regain it†maybe in another form†by his own tapas or austerities ç
in which he succeeded. He pleased God through meditation on the Sun-form ç
and got it.
@SPACE1 = 
The sage Tittiri was an important teacher of this Veda. He was a disciple ç
coming in the great tradition of the Vedic teachers Vy<193>sa and ç
Vai·amp<193>yana. Hence this Veda got the name Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193>. ç
Similarly, since Y<193>j<210>avalkya was the son of `V<193>jaseni' ç
(`one who was famous for giving the gift of v<193>jas or food') Devar<193>ta, ç
his Veda came to be known asV<193>jasaney<200> Sa<221>hit<193>. ç
This is another explanation.
Normally, a Vedic Sa<221>hit<193> consists of only metrical compositions ç
whereas the Br<193>hma<207>as are in prose. Since the Veda taught ç
by Vai·amp<193>yana contained a mixture of these†which is rather unusual ç
†it might have been called K<216><218><207>a (dark, not pure). The ç
other Veda comprising of only the metrical compositions, might have ç
got the title <185>ukla (white, pure).
Some scholars feel that the K<216><218><207>a Yajurveda is the more ç
ancient of the two.
As in the case of the other three Vedas, the Yajurveda also has ç
several branches. They are listed as 101 or 86. However only 5 Sa<221>hit<193>s ç
are available now. They are:
1. Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193>
2. Maitr<193>ya<207><200>ya Sa<221>hit<193>
3. K<193><219>haka Sa<221>hit<193>
4. Kapisthala-K<193><219>haka Sa<221>hit<193>
5. V<193>jasaney<200> Sa<221>hit<193>
@SPACE1 = 
The first four belong to the K<216><218><207>a Yajurveda. Out of ç
these, the fourth has not been recovered fully.
The V<193>jasaney<200> Sa<221>hit<193> is the only Sa<221>hit<193> ç

Most of the gods of the <184>gveda are found here also. Whereas ç
some like Rudra have become more important, others like U<218>as have ç
lost their prominence.
The society reflected through this Veda is similar to that of the ç
<184>gveda. The var<207>a system had been firmly established.
The philosophy of the Yajurveda is same as the one reflected in ç
its Upani<218>ads. The element of devotion to God is also an important ç
factor to be noted.

@NT = Yak<218>a
Though the word yak<218>a occurs in the <184>gveda several times ç

interpret it as a feast orsacrifice. The word occurring in the Atharvaveda ç
(8.9.25) is sometimes interpreted as a monster.
In the Kena Upani<218>ad (3) Brahman is said to have assumed the ç
form of a Yak<218>a to test the gods.
In the epics and the pur<193><207>as the yak<218>as are described ç

One of the best means of spreading religion†as spiritual evolution ç
and ethical values†among the masses is through properly designed dramas ç
with appropriate music and dance. Folk dramas with religious themes, ç
taken mostly from the epics and the pur<193><207>as, have been serving ç
this purpose for centuries.
The Kathakka<202><200> of the Kerala State and the Yak<218>ag<193>na ç
prevalent in the Karnataka State are two such arts worth mentioning. ç
(See <MS>KATHAKKA<170>®<D> for details.)
Though based on the techniques given in the N<193><219>ya·<193>stra ç
of Bharata, the Yak<218>ag<193>na has attained a strong local colour. ç
The artists not only dance vigorously but also sing and talk according ç
to the roles they have to play. There is enough scope to show their ç
talents through impromptu speeches also. The stories and themes are ç
taken mostly from the epics and the pur<193><207>as.
At the background is the master who narrates the story and also sings ç
to the accompaniment of simple musical instruments. Now-a-days use ç
of the harmonium and the m<216>da<209>ga (drum) has become quite common. ç
So also the modern stage set-up.
As far as the costumes and make-up of the artists are concerned, they ç
are very similar to the ones used in the Kathakka<202><200>.

This is one of the most important sections of the great epic Mah<193>bh<193>rata ç
(Vanaparva or Ara<207>yaparva 313). It comprises 90 verses (from ç
45 up to 134) and is in the form of a long dialogue between Yama (the ç
god of death) disguised as a Yak<218>a (a demigod) and Yudhi<218><219>hira, ç
the eldest of the P<193><207><195>avas. The Yak<218>a asks 122 questions ç
and Yudhi<218><219>hira answers all of them satisfactorily.
After losing in the game of dice, the P<193><207><195>avas had to ç
live in a forest for twelve years. Once, during this period of banishment, ç
a br<193>hma<207>a complained to them that a deer had accidentally ç
carried away his ara<207>is (wooden pieces used for attrition to generate ç
the Vedic fire). All the five P<193><207><195>avas tried their best ç
to pursue the animal and catch it or kill it but failed miserably. ç
When they were resting under a tree, tired and thirsty, Yudhi<218><219>hira ç
sent Nakula to fetch some drinking water. As he did not return even ç
after a long time, the other three brothers were also sent one by ç
one. When none of them turned up, Yudhi<218><219>hira himself went ç
in search of them. To his great astonishment and shock, he found all ç
of them lying dead by the side of a beautiful lake. As he was reflecting ç
in himself how it could happen, he saw a Yak<218>a of gigantic proportions. ç
The Yak<218>a told him that his brothers had died since they did not ç
heed not to drink the water of the lake that really belonged to him, ç
unless they answered his questions. Yudhi<218><219>hira in all humility ç
did obeisance to him and offered to answer his queries to the best ç
of his ability. Then ensued a long series of enigmatic questions and ç
scintillating answers.
Many  of  the  questions  are  like riddles. The answers given by ç
Yudhi<218><219>hira †in spite of the explanations offered by N<200>laka<207><219>ha ç
Caturdhara (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1400) in his commentary Bh<193>v<193>rthad<200>pik<193>†are ç
also enigmatic. Hence, only a brief summary of the dialogue which ç
is more intelligible and appears convincing, can now be given:

The Yak<218>a who was actually Yama-dharma, the god of death, was ç
immensely pleased by these answers. He not only revived all the dead ç
brothers of Yudhi<218><219>hira but also gave him other boons asked ç
by him.
@NT = Yama
@N1 = (`one who controls')
@EMERGENCY = In the <184>gveda, the word yama has been used in several ç
mantras, in the sense of twins (vide 1.164.15; 2.39.2).
It has also been used to indicate a god or deity, sometimes identified ç
with the Supreme (vide <184>gveda 1.164.46).
As one of the deities like Indra or Varu<207>a, he is said to be the ç
offspring of Vivasv<193>n (the Sun) and his wife Sa<221>j<210><193>. ç
Hence he is called Vaivasvata also. Yam<200> was his twin-sister.
@EMERGENCY = He is the lord of the pit<216>s or manes. He is the king ç
of the Pit<216>loka, the world of the manes (ibid 9.113.8; 10.16.9).
@EMERGENCY = It is he who is death for the human beings (ibid 10.165.4).
@EMERGENCY = He sends the dead persons to the regions they deserve, ç
good or bad (ibid 10.14.1).
The Ka<219>ha Upani<218>ad is the teaching given by Yama-Vaivasvata ç
to the young seeker Naciketas.
@EMERGENCY = In the epics and the pur<193><207>as he is described ç
as the lord of the South. His capital is the city called Sa<221>yaman<200>. ç
Mahi<218>a or the buffalo is his v<193>hana or mount. The river Yamun<193> ç
is his sister.
@EMERGENCY = He gave many boons to Arjuna when he was performing austerities ç
at the Indrak<200>la mountain. He also gave many boons to S<193>vitr<200>, ç
being pleased with her devotion to her husband Satyav<193>n (Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
Vanaparva 297).
@EMERGENCY = As a result of the curse of the sage A<207>im<193><207><195>avya, ç
Yama was born as Vidura, considered a ·<220>dra by caste (Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
°diparva 108.16).
After testing Yudhi<218><219>hira†his own spiritual son†as a Yak<218>a, ç
he blessed him, fulfilling all his wishes (vide Vanaparva 313).
When he wanted to take away M<193>rka<207><195>eya after his life-duration ç
was completed, he was chastised by Lord <185>iva.
It was he who reminded R<193>ma†at the end of his earthly sojourn†of ç
his promise to return to Vaiku<207><219>ha.
Yama is the first of the eight steps of yoga. See <MS>YOGADAR<185>ANA<D>.
@NT = Yamag<200>t<193>
@N1 = (`song of Yama')
The Hindu epics and the pur<193><207>as contain a large number of ç
religious discourses that often go by the name G<200>t<193>, obviously ç
in imitation of the original, the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata.
There are three such pieces that are called Yamag<200>t<193>. They ç
are part of: the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a (3.7); the Agnipur<193><207>a ç
(381); the N<216>si<221>hapur<193><207>a (8). Out of these, the ç
one in the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a is more well-known. It has ç
just 39 verses.
@SPACE1 = 
Maitreya asks Par<193>·ara about those karmas (actions, way of life) ç
by which a person becomes free from the clutches of Yama, the god ç
of death. Par<193>·ara replies that Nakula had put the same question ç
to Bh<200><218>ma, the grandsire and that Bh<200><218>ma had replied ç
quoting a wise br<193>hma<207>a from the country of Kali<209>ga. This ç
forms the content of the Yamag<200>t<193>.
Once a d<220>ta (servant) of Yama who was to go out in search of the ç
j<200>vas (souls of living beings) about to die, was advised by his ç
master not to touch but leave off the devotees of Vi<218><207>u since ç
he had no control over them. On being asked about the characteristics ç
of a devotee of Vi<218><207>u, Yama described them in detail as follows:
A devotee of Vi<218><207>u never transgresses the duties prescribed ç
for his var<207>a and <193>·rama. He is equanimous towards his friends ç
and foes. He never harms others. He is ever pure in mind and always ç
meditates upon Vi<218><207>u in his heart. He is free from the ari<218>a<195>varga ç
(six passions like lust and greed). He is always peaceful both inside ç
and outside. He can never commit sins or crimes.
Yama then narrated the signs of one who was not a devotee of Vi<218><207>u†an ç
evil person. Such a person robs the wealth of others, tells lies and ç
harms the living beings. He is arrogant, jealous and abuses others, ç
especially the good ones. He never performs yaj<210>as or sacrifices, ç
does not give gifts to deserving persons, nor even treat his own kith ç
and kin properly. Always being in the company of the evil ones, he ç
is committing sins one after another.
Yama's final words of advice to his servant were that he should never ç
touch the devotees of Vi<218><207>u who were ever protected by his ç
cakra or the discus!

The <184>gveda (10.135.1 and 7) gives a brief description of Yamaloka ç
or the world of Yama as a wonderful place full of peace.
