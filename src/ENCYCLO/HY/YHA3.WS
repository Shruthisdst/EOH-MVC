@SB8.5 = T<193>rakayoga
@EMERGENCY = Just as one burning lamp can light another, a perfect ç
guru (spiritual master) can pass on his spiritual power to a qualified ç
or worthy disciple even by a touch. This is called T<193>rakayoga. ç
It is also called ·aktip<193>ta or bequeathing spiritual power.
In Hindu astrology, the word yoga is used in a technical sense to ç
indicate the fourth limb of the pa<210>c<193><209>ga or almanac. (See ç
<MS>PA<178>C°<177>GA<D>.)
@NT = Yogac<220>d<193>ma<207>i Upani<218>ad
This is one of the twenty minor Upani<218>ads  called  Yoga  Upani<218>ads.  It ç
belongs to the S<193>maveda.
There are 121 ·lokas occasionally interspersed with prose passages. ç
Thereis one commentary by Upani<218>ad Brahmendra who has written ç
vivara<207>as or explanations on 108 Upani<218>ads.
The work opens with listing six yog<193><209>gas or limbs of yoga. ç
They are: <193>sana (posture); pr<193><207>asa<221>rodha (pr<193><207><193>y<193>ma ç
or breath-control); praty<193>h<193>ra (withdrawal of senses); dh<193>ra<207><193> ç
(fixing the mind on the object of concentration); dhy<193>na (meditation) ç
and sam<193>dhi (perfect concentration resulting in superconscious ç
experience).
This is followed by a description of the six cakras or psychic centres ç
in the body. They are: m<220>l<193>dh<193>ra (at the root of the spinal ç
column); sv<193>dhi<218><219>h<193>na (at the root of the sexual organ); ç
ma<207>ip<220>ra (at the navel); an<193>hata (at the level of the ç
heart); vi·uddha (at the level of the throat); <193>j<210><193> (between ç
the eyebrows).
Then comes a brief exposition of the five major pr<193><207>as like ç
pr<193><207>a and ap<193>na, and the five minor pr<193><207>as (called ç
upapr<193><207>as) like n<193>ga, k<220>rma and so on. The j<200>va ç
(bound soul) moves about because of their activity.
Next comes ajap<193>g<193>yatr<200>. It is the repetition of the mantra ç
ha<221>sa<199> so'ha<221> coupled with breathing.
Now, a description of rousing the Ku<207><195>alin<200> and making ç
it move up the su<218>umn<193> canal is given. Incidentally, theregimen ç
of food for a yogi is also mentioned.
This is followed by a delineation ofbandhas or mudr<193>s. They are: ç
m<220>labandha, o<195><195>iy<193><207>a, j<193>landhara, khecar<200>, ç
vajrol<200> and mah<193>mudr<193>.
A long passage in prose, giving a description of Brahman the Absolute ç
and the process of creation is given as the next subject. Pra<207>ava ç
or O<221> is its symbol.
The three parts of Pra<207>ava, viz., a, u, and m, and what ç
they signify is expounded next.
Then follows pra<207>avajapa or repetition of O<221> with meditation ç
on the light of the <193>tman.
The other topics discussed towards the end are: certain aspects of ç
pr<193><207><193>y<193>ma, results of a few yogic practices and a ç
special mudr<193> or posture called <218>a<207>mukh<200>-mudr<193>.
@NT = Yogadar·ana
@SB8.5 = Introduction
Indian philosophical systems are known as `dar·anas.' Unlike the Western ç
philosophical systems, they do not depend solely on logic andreasoning, ç
but on `dar·ana' or `seeing' or `experiencing' thetruth, in mystical ç
states. Hence the appropriateness of the term. The dar·anas have been ç
classified into two groups: the <193>stika and the n<193>stika. Those ç
that are based on the authority of the Vedas are called `<193>stika' ç
and the rest are `n<193>stika.' The C<193>rv<193>ka (Materialism), ç
the Jaina and the Bauddha systems come under the latter category and, ç
the <186>a<195>-dar·anas or the six traditional systems of Hindu philosophy, ç
under the former.
The six traditional systems are: Ny<193>ya, Vai·e<218>ika, S<193><209>khya, ç
Yoga, M<200>m<193><221>s<193> and Ved<193>nta. They generally deal ç
with four topics: existence and nature of Brahman or ®·vara or God; ç
nature of the j<200>va or the individual soul; creation of jagat or ç
the world; mok<218>a or liberation as also the disciplines that lead ç
to it.
@SB8.5 = S<193><209>khya and Yoga Dar·anas
The word `S<193><209>khya' has been derived from `sa<209>khy<193>,' ç
which means j<210><193>na or knowledge. Since the S<193><209>khya ç
system of the sage Kapila declares j<210><193>na as the sole or primary ç
means of attaining mok<218>a† called `kaivalya' in this system†it ç
has been designated as `S<193><209>khya-dar·ana'. `Sa<209>khy<193>' ç
also means `number'. Since this system has fixed the number of the ç
basic cosmic principles as 24 + 1, it might have earned this appellation ç
for itself.
The S<193><209>khya system accepts only puru<218>a (the individual ç
soul) and pradh<193>na or prak<216>ti (nature) as the fundamental ç
realities and does not accept ®·vara or God. Hence it is sometimes ç
called `Nir<200>·vara-S<193><209>khya' (`S<193><209>khya without ®·vara'). ç
The Yogadar·ana which accepts all the principles of the S<193><209>khya ç
and also ®·vara or God, in addition, has been designated as `Se·vara-S<193><209>khya' ç
(`S<193><209>khya with ®·vara').
In the S<193><209>khya system, tattvaj<210><193>na or enquiry into ç
the nature of truth is of primary importance. But the Yoga system ç
deals primarily with s<193>dhanas or spiritual disciplines. That is ç
why the Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali, the basic text of the Yoga ç
system, begins with the words atha yog<193>nu·<193>sanam (`Now, ç
the teaching of Yoga [is begun].'), instead of the words, `jij<210><193>s<193>' ç
or `m<200>m<193><221>s<193>' (`enquiry').
@SB8.5 = What is Yoga?
The word `yoga' can be derived from two verbal roots: yuj (to yoke) ç
or yuj (to concentrate). Hence `yoga' is that which helps a j<200>va ç
or the individual soul to attain concentration on ®·vara and ultimate ç
union with him.
The word `yoga' in its several senses has been used in the <184>gveda ç
(5.81.1) and some of the Upani<218>ads like the Ka<219>ha (6.10,<|>11; ç
2.12) and the <185>vet<193>·vatara (1.3). The Bhagavadg<200>t<193> ç
(6.11, 13, 20 and 35) contains many ideas which appear to reflect ç
the teachings of the Yogas<220>tras (c.f.2.46; 1.2; 1.12). It is ç
likely that there might have been a more ancient work on Yoga attributed ç
to Hira<207>yagarbha, and this could have influenced other works.
@SB8.5 = The Author and His Times
Hindu tradition attributes the origin of the science of Yoga to Hira<207>yagarbha, ç
an aspect of God himself. Two sages† Sanatkum<193>ra and Jaigi<218>avya†are ç
sometimes stated to be the authors of Yoga-·<193>stra. However, their ç
works have not been traced till now.
Among the works on Yoga available now, the Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali ç
seems to be the most ancient one. Whether thePata<210>jali who wrote ç
the bh<193><218>ya or commentary on the s<220>tras of P<193><207>ini ç
and the Pata<210>jali of the Yogas<220>tras are the same or not, ç
has not been conclusively established. A work on °yurveda, also attributed ç
to him, has not been traced so far.
Scholars opine that Pata<210>jali mighthave lived during the period ç
200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D><192><MS>A.<|>D.<D> 300.
@SB8.5 = The Work
Like the other works of the six dar·anas, Pata<210>jali's treatise ç
also is in the form of s<220>tras. A s<220>tra is a brief mnemonic ç
statement with a minimum of letters, but expressing a vast amount ç
knowledge.
The Yogas<220>tras comprises 195 s<220>tras spread over four p<193>das ç
or chapters. They are: Sam<193>dhip<193>da (s<220>s. 51); S<193>dhanap<193>da ç
(s<220>s.  55);  Vibh<220>tip<193>da  (s<220>s.  55)  and Kaivalyap<193>da ç
(s<220>s. 34).
A S<220>tra work, by its very nature, is ambiguous, if not obscure, ç
and hence needs a commentary to unravel it. Fortunately for us, the ç
work Yogas<220>tras has attracted the attention of a number of savants ç
whohave enriched the yoga literature bytheir earned commentaries ç
and sub- commentaries.
The Bh<193><218>ya of Vy<193>sa is regarded asthe basic commentary ç
honoured by almost all the later writers. This Vy<193>sa, considered ç
to be different from the traditional Vedavy<193>sa, lived perhaps ç
during the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 400.
The following are the glosses on this Vy<193>sabh<193><218>ya:
@SPACE1 =

There is one Yogabh<193><218>yavivara<207>a attributed to <185>a<209>kara ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 788-820). Whether the work is really that of the famous ç
teacher of Advaita Ved<193>nta or not, scholars do not seem to agree. ç
The style of writing and the presentation, as also the belief that ç
<185>a<209>kara was a great yogi, lends some support to the view that ç
he is the author of this work.
There are at least six commentaries written directly on the Yogas<220>tras. ç
Theyare:
@NID = R<193>jam<193>rtt<193><207><195>av<216>tti of Bhojadeva<R>ç

Yogasudh<193>kara of<R>ç
<+><+><+><+>Sad<193>·iva Brahmendra (18th cent.).
@SB8.5 = Philosophy of the Yogas<220>tras
Though the Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali is primarily a work heavily ç
oriented towards s<193>dhana or spiritual practice, a basic knowledge ç
of its S<193><209>khyan background is necessary to understand it.
Yogadar·ana accepts three funda-mental realities: ®·vara, puru<218>as ç
and pradh<193>na or prak<216>ti.
Puru<218>as are the individual souls. They are cidr<220>pa or of the ç
nature of consciousness and are infinite in number.
The existence of ®·vara, called `Puru<218>avi·e<218>a' (`special or ç
unique puru<218>a') can be known only through the scriptures. He is ç
sarvaj<210>a or omniscient. Being untouched by the shackles of prak<216>ti ç
he is ever free. He is the <193>diguru, the primeval teacher. He is ç
designated by pra<207>ava or O<221>. It is by his will and in accordance ç
withthe karmas of the puru<218>as that prak<216>ti, comprising the ç
three gu<207>as sattva, rajas and tamas, evolves into this universe. ç
The evolutes of prak<216>ti are mahat (cosmic intellect), aha<209>k<193>ra ç
(the ego-principle), manas (cosmic mind), the tanm<193>tras (subtle ç
elements) and so on, just as in the S<193><209>khyan system.
The puru<218>a or the individual soul, somehow†due to avidy<193> or ç
nescience†forgets his real nature as pure consciousness, gets involved ç
with the evolutes of prak<216>ti and suffers all the pangs of birth, ç
death and transmigration. However, when he performs s<193>dhanas†the ç
a<218><219><193><209>gas or the eight steps of yoga†he once again ç
realises his essential nature and is instantly freed from sa<221>s<193>ra, ç
the cycle of transmigration. Being established in oneself, thus transcending ç
sa<221>s<193>ra, is called `kaivalya'.
@SB8.5 = Yoga as `Cittav<216>ttinirodha'
@SPACE1 = 
Pata<210>jali defines yoga as cittav<216>tti-nirodha<199> (1.2). ç
When all the v<216>ttis or modifications of the citta or the mind ç
are controlled and suppressed (= niruddha), the true nature of the ç
puru<218>a or the Self is revealed. Citta is the mind-stuff that is ç
variously called as anta<199>kara<207>a (the inner instrument), manas ç
(the mind) or buddhi (the intellect). The waves of thoughts, feelings ç
and emotions that arise in it due to the impact of the sense-objects ç
upon it through the sense-organs like the eyes and the ears, are called ç
`cittav<216>ttis.' Though these cittav<216>ttis appear to be innumerable, ç
they can be classified under five groups: pram<193><207>a (means of ç
right knowledge), viparyaya (false-knowledge), vikalpa (mental picture ç
based on hearing a word), nidr<193> (sleep) and sm<216>ti (memory).
Pram<193><207>a is the means of right knowledge. The pram<193><207>as ç
are three: pratyak<218>a (direct perception), anum<193>na (inference) ç
and <193>gama (words of reliable persons and the scriptures).
Viparyaya is false knowledge as thatof seeing a snake in a rope in ç
semi- darkness.
Vikalpa is the mental picture that arises on hearing a word or words ç
like ``R<193>hu's head'' (R<193>hu, the malefic planet has only the ç
head and no other part of the body).
Nidr<193> or sleep is that condition of mind where its modifications ç
arise out of a preponderance of tamas.
Sm<216>ti is the memory of previous experiences.
These cittav<216>ttis when they produce kle·a or suffering to the ç
puru<218>a due to avidy<193> (ignorance), asmit<193> (egoism) and ç
so on, are called kli<218><219>a. When they help the puru<218>a to ç
free himself from them, they become `akli<218><219>a'.
@SPACE1 = 
The citta or the mind has five states: k<218>ipta (impulsive), m<220><195>ha ç
(dull), vik<218>ipta (distracted), ek<193>gra (one-pointed) and niruddha ç
(inhibited). Yoga is not possible in the first three states since ç
the mind is in the grip of rajas and tamas. When sattva predominates, ç
the mind can attain one-pointedness leading it to sampraj<210><193>ta-sam<193>dhi ç
(state of perfect concentration where there is a clear cognition of ç
the object). In the last, the niruddha state, there is a total suppression ç
of all modifica- tions, leading to asampraj<210><193>ta-sam<193>dhi, ç
where no object is cognized and the puru<218>a remains established ç
in his intrinsic state. Then he becomes a mukta, a liberated soul, ç
freed from all the trammels of prak<216>ti.
@SB8.5 = Obstacles to Yoga
Pata<210>jali calls the obstacles to yoga as `antar<193>yas' (`that ç
which comes in between') and lists them as nine (1.30): vy<193>dhi ç
(illness), sty<193>na(apathy), sa<221>·aya (doubt), pram<193>da (heedlessness), ç
<193>lasya (laziness), avirati (lack of renunciation), bhr<193>ntidar·ana ç
(misconception), alabdha-bh<220>mikatva (failure to attain yogic states) ç
and anavasthitatva (instability in the state).
Illness has to be remedied by medical treatment. Apathy has to be ç
overcome byexercising will-power. Doubt must be countered by faith ç
in the scriptures andthe preceptor. Heedlessness must be abolished ç
by eternal vigilance. Laziness should be conquered by healthy activity. ç
Lack of renunciation should be nullified through viveka (discrimination) ç
and vair<193>gya (detachment). The last three obstacles must be tackled ç
as per the advice of a competent preceptor.
Pata<210>jali names five more obstacles to  yoga  (1.31)  since  they  too  distract ç
the  mind.  They  are:  du<199>kha  (pain), daurmanasya (frustration), ç
a<209>gamejayatva (restlessness of the limbs of the body), ·v<193>sa ç
and pra·v<193>sa (spasmodic breathing in or out). They too have to ç
be countered by appropriate remedies.
@SB8.5 = Some Practical Hints
Pata<210>jali gives quite a few suggestions which help an aspirant ç
to ward off the obstacles to yoga and attain greater concentration, ç
ultimately leading to sam<193>dhi or mystical experience of the self. ç
Out of these, vair<193>gya (detachment or thespirit of renunciation) ç
and abhy<193>sa (constant practice) come first (1.12). The former ç
helps one to take the mind away from the sense-objects whereas the ç
latter leads it towards the Self or God.
Other hints given are: an attitude of friendship (maitr<200>) towards ç
those who are happy (instead of feeling jealous of them); compassion ç
(karu<207><193>) towards those who are suffering; controlling the ç
pr<193><207>ic energy by regulating the breath; meditating on the ç
light in the centre of one's heart; contemplating on the minds of ç
great persons; repeatedly remembering highly elevating dreams if one ç
had had them; and contemplating on the forms of gods and goddesses ç
or planets like the moon or the psychic centres in one's own body.
All these methods help the spiritual aspirant to gain peace of mind ç
as also greater control over it.
@SB8.5 = A<218><219><193><209>gas or Eight Steps
The puru<218>a or the j<200>v<193>tman (indi-vidual soul) is in bondage ç
because of his inordinate attachment to his body-mind complex, which ç
is a product of prak<216>ti. The aim of yoga is `viyoga' (separating) ç
of the puru<218>a from the clutches of prak<216>ti. This comes about ç
by vivekakhy<193>ti or the knowledge that prak<216>ti and puru<218>a ç
are essentially separate from each other (khy<193>ti = knowledge; ç
viveka = discrimi-nation).
The Yogas<220>tras prescribes a graded discipline comprising eight ç
steps, called the `a<218><219><193><209>gas' of yoga. They are: yama ç
(restraint), niyama (observances), <193>sana (posture), pr<193><207><193>y<193>ma ç
(control of vital currents), praty<193>h<193>ra (state of withdrawal), ç
dh<193>ra<207><193> (concentration), dhy<193>na (meditation) and sam<193>dhi ç
(total absorption). Out of these, the first five are considered as ç
`bahira<209>gas' (external aids) and the last three as `antara<209>gas' ç
(internal aids) to yoga.
Ahi<221>s<193> (non-injury), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), ç
brahmacarya (continence) and aparigraha (non-acceptance of gifts) ç
constitute yama, the first step.
Niyama includes ·auca (cleanliness), santo<218>a (contentment), tapas ç
(austerity of body, speech and mind), sv<193>dhy<193>ya (study of ç
holy books and repetition of mantras like O<221>), and ®·varapra<207>idh<193>na ç
(devotion to God).
The  former  contribute  to  social harmony and the latter to personal ç
purity. The three disciplines of tapas, sv<193>dhy<193>ya and   <200>·varapra<207>idh<193>na   are   grouped ç
together by Pata<210>jali and christened as `Kriy<193>yoga'. It is ç
effective as a shortcut to yoga.
°sana is that posture in which one can sit steadily and comfortably ç
for the practice of yoga. Pr<193><207><193>y<193>ma is controlling ç
the vital airs in the body, through the regulation of breathing. When ç
the sense-organs are withdrawn from the sense- objects they remain ç
merged as it were, in the mind. This is called praty<193>h<193>ra.
@SPACE1 = 
The next three disciplines†dh<193>ra<207><193>, dhy<193>na and sam<193>dhi†are ç
actually three continuous steps of the same process. In dh<193>ra<207><193>, ç
the mind is fixed on the object of concentration. When this concentration ç
becomes uninterrupted, like the oil being poured from one vessel into ç
another, it is dhy<193>na. When dhy<193>na ripens into a state of ç
total absorption on the object, so much so, that the aspirant is not ç
aware of even his own existence, it is called sam<193>dhi. Sam<193>dhi ç
can be attained by <200>·vara-pra<207>idh<193>na or devotion to God ç
also (1.23).
Pata<210>jali terms these three steps together as `sa<221>yama'. And, ç
this sa<221>yama should always be on one and the same object.
@SB8.5 = Yogasiddhis
The belief that one can attain supernatural powers by tapas and by ç
the grace of God is very ancient. Pata<210>jali describes quite a ç
few of such powers in the second and the third chapters in order to ç
generate faith in the minds of the ordinary seekers of truth. For ç
instance, he declares that while in the company of a person who is ç
well-established in the virtue of ahi<221>s<193>, even animals inimical ç
to one another (like a tiger and a cow) will live in peace and mutual ç
harmony. The words of a person rooted in satya will be infallible. ç
One who observes aparigraha very strictly can get a knowledge of his ç
past and future lives (vide 2.35, 36 and 39).
@SPACE1 = 
Sa<221>yama on different objects will endow the yogi with several ç
occult powers. For instance, by sa<221>yama on the five elements like ç
p<216>thv<200> (earth) and ap (water), the yogi can get a<218><219>asiddhis ç
or the eight- fold powers like a<207>im<193> (power to become atomic ç
in size), mahim<193> (power to grow to any large size) and so on (3.44, ç
45). Some of the other powers given in the work are: thought-reading, ç
disappearance from view, getting enormous strength, understanding ç
the language of animals and other creatures, and soon.
However, Pata<210>jali, who as a scientist of mind, describes these ç
powers (since they are part of the science), also cautions the aspirant ç
of yoga not to seek them. The temptation for these powers can lead ç
him away from the goal of his life, viz., kaivalya or liberation. ç
But, after the attainment of kaivalya†since he may continue to live ç
for some more time due to pr<193>rabdha-karma (the karma that has ç
started this life)†he will have those powers and can safely use them ç
for the good of mankind.
@SB8.5 = Conclusion
The Yogadar·ana is not only ancient but also very practical. Even ç
the Ved<193>ntic systems  accept  its  s<193>dhana  aspects. Modern ç
psychologists too are discovering its utility in guarding or in regaining ç
mental health. Methods and techniques of yoga are becoming quite popular ç
all over the world. The first two steps†yama and niyama†can contribute ç
to the well-being of the individual as well as of the society. The ç
various <193>sanas†better known as yog<193>sanas†can help in regaining ç
or maintaining one's health. Thus the Yoga system is gradually gaining ç
universal acceptance.
@NT = yogajapratyak<218>a
@N1-1 = (`direct perception born out of [the practice of] yoga')
Normally, the knowledge that we get from pratyak<218>a or direct perception, ç
is derived through our five j<210><193>nendriyas or organs of knowledge ç
like the eyes and the ears. This knowledge is very limited due to ç
various factors such as defects of the organs or external obstacles. ç
However, when the yogi attains the state of sam<193>dhi, the powers ç
of his mind are heightened to such an extent that he can `see' anything ç
he likes, even if such an object is hidden in the ground or obstructed ç
by impervious things like a wall or is at a great distance. This is ç
called yogajapratyaka. See Yoga-s<220>tras (1.35 and 3.25).
@NT = yogak<218>ema
This word has been used in the <184>gveda (10.166.5) in the sense ç
of earning wealth (yoga) and protecting it after earning (k<218>ema). ç
In the dharma·<193>stras the word has been interpreted as i<218><219><193> ç
or sacrifices (for yoga) and p<220>rta or public works of charity ç
(for k<218>ema). Another meaning  is  comfortable  living  (vide ç
Gautama Dharmas<220>tras 9.63).
Some others have declared that it indicates the royal ministers and ç
the royal priest since they bring about the welfare of the nation ç
(vide Mit<193>k<218>ar<193>†commentary on Y<193>j<210>avalkya Sm<216>ti ç
2.119).
However, in the well-known verse of the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (9.22), ç
all the commentators agree that yoga means getting what one wants, ç
and k<218>ema, protecting it.
Attaining God is yoga. Mok<218>a or freedom from transmigration is ç
k<218>ema. This can be a philosophical interpretation.
@NT = Yogam<193>y<193>
The power of ®·vara or God, by which he creates, sustains and withdraws ç
the world, is called M<193>y<193> or Yogam<193>y<193>. She is pictured ç
as a goddess and considered an aspect of Durg<193>.
According to the Bh<193>gavata (10.3.47) she was born to Ya·od<193> ç
on the same day as K<216><218><207>a was born to Devak<200>. She was ç
exchanged with K<216><218><207>a, by Vasudeva.
When Ka<221>sa, the demon-king of Mathur<193>, tried to kill her she ç
escaped from his grip, assumed her real form as Durg<193> and warned ç
him.
Her birthday is celebrated in some places on the day next to K<216><218><207>a's.
The Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (7.25) refers to her as the power of delusion.
@NT = yogamudr<193>
Mudr<193>s or handposes are common to the images of gods and sages.
In the yogamudr<193>, the left palm facing upwards is kept on the ç
lap of the sitting image, with the right one, in the same fashion, ç
being placed over it. It indicates deep meditation.
@NT = yogan<193>l<193>
See <MS><186>A£°DH°RAPRATI<186><187>H°<D>.
@NT = Yog<193>narasi<221>ha
This is one of the variant forms of Narasi<221>ha, the fourth incarnation ç
of Vi<218><207>u in the Da·<193>vat<193>ra list.
Here, Narasi<221>ha is shown as sitting, absorbed in deep yogic meditation. ç
There is a band, `yogapa<219><219>a' binding his legs at the level ç
of the knees. Of the four hands, the upper two carry the cakra (discus) ç
and ·a<209>kha (conch). The two lower hands are resting on the knees.
@NT = yog<193><209>ga
This is a technical term used in V<200>ra·aivism. See under <MS><185>AIVISM<D>.
The word may also indicate one of the eight steps of yoga as given ç
in the Yogadar·ana of Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>).
@NT = Yoganidr<193>
@N1 = (`sleep-like condition in yoga')
@SPACE1 = 
After pralaya or dissolution of the world, before next creation, God ç
(Vi<218><207>u) is said to rest in sleep. It is actually a sleep-like ç
condition and is called yoganidr<193>.
Iconographical works like the P<193>dma-sa<221>hit<193> describe ç
Yoganidr<193> as a goddess, dark in colour, resting on a cot in a ç
half sleepy state. She has two hands, the left carrying a noose and ç
the right a p<193>nap<193>tra or a bowl of intoxicating drink.
@NT = yogapa<219><219>a
@N1 = (`cloth of yoga')
This is the band of cloth used for holding the crossed legs firmly ç
in position while practising yogic meditation. It goes round the two ç
legs at the level of the knees, the legs being slightly raised. It ç
may be wound round in other ways also.
@SPACE1 = 
Yogapa<219><219>a is a technical term used in the process of giving ç
sa<221>ny<193>sa or monastic vows. It is the act of giving the monastic ç
name to the newly ordained disciple after holding a cloth over his ç
headand reciting some verses from the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (11.15 ç
to 33). The disciple is, hence forward, competent to ordain others ç
into sa<221>ny<193>sa and guide them.
