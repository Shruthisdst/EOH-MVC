@NT = dadhi
@N1 = (`that [which] sustains')
Derived from the root `dh<193>' (to support, to sustain) the word ç
`dadhi' represents curds (curdled milk or yoghurt), since, perhaps, ç
it is considered to be a better food item than milk in sustaining ç
the health of the body.
It has important uses in Vedic sacri-fices. It is used to curdle fresh, ç
hot, milk which is used as oblation and also consumed by the sacrificer ç
in the Dar·a sacrifice. So also in the °graya<207>a rite. In the animal ç
sacrifice (Pa·ubandha) it is utilised to prepare p<216><218>ad<193>jya ç
(a mixture of curds and ghee) used for sprinkling over the immolated ç
animal. It is expected to be consumed by the sacrificer in the d<200>k<218><193> ç
rite (consecration of the sacrificer in a Soma sacrifice).
`Dadhigraha' refers to the drawing of curds offered to Praj<193>pati ç
just before the morning pressing of the soma juice.
`Dadhigharma' is a beverage of hot milk and curdled milk poured into ç
a warm pot by the adhvaryu priest and used as a libation at the midday ç
pressing of the soma juice in a Somay<193>ga. `Dadhimantha' is a beverage ç
of grains (saktu) mixed with curds, also used in sacrifices.
@NT = Dadh<200>ci
Dadh<200>ci (also spelt as `Dadh<200>ca') was a great sage who willingly ç
sacrificed his life to help the gods conquer their eternal foes, the ç
asuras.
Once the gods deposited their various weapons with the sage Dadh<200>ci ç
for safe custody. But they did not return in the stipulated time. ç
Since the weapons were getting rusted and were crumbling, the sage ç
dissolved them in water and drank the same. They got merged in his ç
backbone making it immensely strong. When the gods, under the leadership ç
of their king Indra came back and asked for the return of their weapons, ç
Dadh<200>ci told them what he had done. Since they requested for his ç
backbone, out of which a great weapon could be made and with which ç
their formidable foe, V<216>tr<193>sura, could be killed, he immediately ç
obliged them by giving up his body in yoga. Indra's Vajr<193>yudha ç
(thunderbolt) was prepared out of it.
Dadh<200>ci stands for the highest ideal of self-sacrifice for social ç
good.
He was the son of Atharva<207>a and <185><193>nti. The well-known ç
sage Pippal<193>da of Upani<218>adic fame was his son.

The political and social turmoil in medieval India was also responsible† ç
though in a strange and inscrutable way† to throw up many a great ç
saint who tried by their lives and teachings, to show that the true ç
spirit of religion lies in inner mystical experience and not in dry ç
rituals or meaningless formalities.
D<193>d<220> (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1544-1603) was one of the brighter stars ç
of this period and the most famous of the followers of Kab<200>r's ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1440-1518) ideals. Born in Ahmedabad (in Gujarat) he ç
seems to have spent most of his time in Rajasthan. He passed away ç
in the village Nar<193><207><193> (or N<193>r<193>ya<207>a) of Rajasthan, ç
where his followers†known as `D<193>d<220>panthis'†have their chief ç
centre even now.
He established the `Brahma or Parabrahma Samprad<193>ya' with a view ç
to uniting all the divergent faiths in one bond of love and friendship.
He did not believe in the authority of the scriptures but in the value ç
of realisation. He laid great stress on the cultivation ofvirtues ç
like humility, compassion, fearlessness, forgiveness and firmness ç
in one's path.
He was a householder and believed that the natural life of the householder ç
was best suited for spiritual realisation.
His children too (two sons and two daughters) were persons of high ç
spiritual calibre.
At his request, his disciples made (in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1600) a collection ç
of the devotional writings of all the different sects. This anthology, ç
containing the sayings of many Muslim saints also, helped the spiritual ç
aspirants of all types in their journey towards perfection.

Right from the Vedic days Hindus have been rather fastidious in choosing ç
`good' days and avoiding `bad' days for the starting of any venture. ç
Even now, even the average Hindu, is very particular about this.
Such days are generally decided with the help of astrologers and priests ç
who consult the pa<210>c<193><209>ga (the almanac) and give their ç
opinion. One of the inauspicious days mentioned there, is called `dagdha-yoga'. ç
If the week days from Sunday to Saturday occur on certain tithis (days ç
as per the lunar calendar) as shown below, they are called `dagdhayogas'. ç
The name is perhaps derived from the reason that ventures started ç
on such days of the week, united (yoga = union) with certain tithis, ç
become dagdha or destroyed (dagdha = burnt, destroyed).

The  Hindu  mythological  lore  is replete with the stories of constant ç
wars and conflicts between the suras and the asuras, the devas and ç
the d<193>navas.
The sage Ka·yapa has been projected by these stories as the progenitor ç
of all living beings. He had thirteen wives, all of whom were daughters ç
of Dak<218>a-praj<193>pati. Among these, Aditi, Diti and Danu were ç
more well-known.
The sons of Aditi are <193>dityas or <193>diteyas (same as devas or ç
suras or gods), of Diti, the daityas and of Danu, the d<193>navas. ç
Sometimes the asuras, the daityas and the d<193>navas (as also the ç
r<193>k<218>asas) are bracketed together. They seem to be the archetypes ç
of violent, greedy and sinful beings. However, even from among them ç
great persons like Prahl<193>da, Bali and B<193><207>a had been born ç
and their lives as men of virtue and devotees of God had been exemplary.
@NT = daiva
@N1 = (`related to deva,' `luck or fate')
Throughout the history of mankind, some kind of belief in destiny, ç
in the unseen hand of fate, seems to have existed. The Hindus have ç
been no exception to this phenomenon.
The word `daiva' has been derived from `deva', a god or a superior ç
being or a supernatural power. In effect, it means the unseen power ç
of fate (ad<216><218><219>a).
The dharma·<193>stras and the pur<193><207>as have discussed in detail, ç
the question whether daiva is more powerful or puru<218>ak<193>ra ç
(human effort). Three different views have emerged: (1) Daiva is all- ç
powerful; (2) Human effort is superior; (3)Both have an equal place ç
in our life.
Since daiva (fate or luck) is generally interpreted as the cumulative ç
effect of our past karmas tending to give a particular direction in ç
this life, the third view seems to be more reasonable.

@NT = daivata-li<209>ga
@N1 = (`li<209>ga [of gods]')
<185>iva, the third deity of the Hindu Trinity, is always worshipped ç
as a li<209>ga, a cylindrical symbol with a spherical top. The word ç
`li<209>ga' means that Supreme Power into which the whole universe ç
dissolves at the end of creation (`l<200>yate asmin iti li<209>ga<199>').
A li<209>ga can be cala (movable) or acala (immovable). The li<209>gas ç
in <185>iva temples are always acala. Such acala-li<209>gas can be ç
of several varieties†4 or 6 or even 9†of which the daivata-li<209>ga ç
(also called `daivika-li<209>ga') is one. Since it is supposed to ç
have been established by the gods of heaven it gets this name (daiva ç
= related to gods).
Its shape resembles that of a flame of light and suggests to our mind ç
hands folded in supplication. Its surface is rugged and contains marks ç
of <219>a<209>ka (hammer) and ·<220>la (spear). There is no brahmas<220>tra ç

@NT = daiva-viv<193>ha
@N1 = (`marriage [related to the rite] of gods')
Viv<193>ha or marriage has been a very ancient institution right from ç

of the dvijas (`the twice-born,' the br<193>hma<207>as, the k<218>attriyas ç
and the vai·yas) even in the modern days draw heavily from the Vedic ç
and allied literature.
Of  the  eight  forms  of  marriage depicted in the ancient works ç
like the G<216>hyas<220>tras, the daiva-viv<193>ha is also one and ç
is classed among the superior varieties. It is described as gifting ç
one's daughter, after properly decorating her, to a priest who has ç
officiated in the sacrifice. It was almost like dak<218>i<207><193> ç
or sacrificial fee.
It was called `daiva' since the sacrifice was for appeasing the devas ç
or gods like Indra and the gifting of the girl took place as a part ç
of the sacrifice.
This form of marriage seems to have been discouraged and hence disappeared ç
in course of time.

The Bhagavadg<200>t<193> is a cardinal scripture of Hinduism revered ç
by all sections of the Hindus. It has also attracted the attention ç
of many a spiritual seeker and savant from the great religions of ç
the world.
The sixteenth chapter of this work deals with two archetypes among ç
the human beings†the <193>suric or the demoniac and the daiv<200> ç
or the divine beings. The former are hostile to all moral and spiritual ç
values whereas the latter are fully receptive to them.
These moral and spiritual values listed in this chapter (16.1-3) are ç
called `daiv<200>sampad' or `daiv<200>sampat', a wealth (sampat = ç
wealth) that ultimately leads to the attainment of the divine state ç
(daiv<200>= divine).
They  are:  abhaya  (fearlessness), sattvasa<221>·uddhi (purity of ç
the heart), j<210><193>na-yoga-vyavasthiti (steadfastness in knowledge ç
and devotion), d<193>na (benevolence), dama (control of senses), yaj<210>a ç

of body, speech and mind), <193>rjava (uprightness), ahi<221>s<193> ç
(non-violence), satya (truth), akrodha (freedom from anger), ty<193>ga ç
(renunciation), ·<193>nti (tranquillity), apai·una (aversion to slander),  bh<220>te<218>u  day<193>  (compassion ç

their fierce aspect, like K<193>l<200>. Their function is to assume ç
terrible forms to instil fear in the hearts of people who are inimical ç

devotees, along the right path.

@N1 = (`able,' `competent')
@SPACE = 
A praj<193>pati or Father of beings, Dak<218>a is a familiar figure ç
often mentioned in the Hindu mythological literature. There appear ç
to be two Dak<218>as, belonging to two different periods known as ç
manvantaras. (See <MS>MANVANTARA.<D>)
The first belonged to the Sv<193>yam-bhuva-manvantara and had married ç
Pras<220>ti, the daughter of the Manu Svayambh<220>. Out of the 24 ç
daughters he begot in her, Sat<200> was one who had been married to ç
<185>iva.
Once a misunderstanding developed between Dak<218>a and <185>iva due ç
to the apparent disrespect shown by the latter. When Dak<218>a performed ç
a big yaj<210>a or sacrifice, he ignored <185>iva completely and did ç
not invite him. However, Sat<200>, due to her filial love towards ç
her father Dak<218>a, went to attend the same much against her husband ç
<185>iva's warning. Being incensed by the callous behaviour of her ç
father she gave up her body in the hall of sacrifice itself in yoga. ç
Enraged by this tragedy, <185>iva got Dak<218>a's sacrifice desecrated ç
and destroyed through V<200>rabhadra, a terrific emanation from himself. ç
Dak<218>a too was beheaded but was restored to life by the all-merciful ç
<185>iva at the importunate pleadings of the gods. Dak<218>a's regrets ç
and apology once again restored the good relationship between them.
The second Dak<218>a (of the C<193>k<218>u<218>a-manvantara) was commanded ç
by Brahm<193> (creator) to proceed with the creation of living beings. ç
He did so using his psychic powers.  Devas  (Gods),  <216><218>is  (sages), ç
gandharvas ( a type of semi-divine beings), asuras (demons), sarpas ç
(serpents) apart from human beings were all created by him.
Dak<218>a is also the name of an ancient author of a sm<216>ti (a ç
secondary scripture, a law-book) which is generally called Dak<218>asm<216>ti. ç
The extant work has seven chapters and 220 verses. The topics dealt ç
with are varied. Apart from Var<207><193>·rama-dharmas, the subjects ç
include the giving of gifts, eulogy of a good housewife, a·auca or ç
ceremonial impurity to be observed on birth or death in one's family, ç
certain aspects of yoga and the philosophy of advaita.

Dak<218>a, she was reborn as the daughter of Himav<193>n and Men<193> ç

@NT = dak<218>i<207><193>
@N1 = (`sacrificial fees')
One of the important items of a Vedic sacrifice is dak<218>i<207><193> ç
or the fees to be paid to the priests involved in the conduct of the ç
sacrifice. Generally cows and gold are considered superior among the ç
various kinds of dak<218>i<207><193>s. Other animals, articles of ç
food or anything that will be useful to the donees are also prescribed.
Though it is limited to small quanti-ties in minor rites, fabulous ç
amounts are expected to be given in complicated rites, such as the ç
R<193>jas<220>yay<193>ga.
It is interesting to note that a non-br<193>hma<207>a may be given ç
dak<218>i<207><193> if he is learned, whereas, a br<193>hma<207>a ç
of a different gotra (lineage) or who is not learned, is not entitled ç
for it!
A sacrifice where dak<218>i<207><193> has not been paid becomes barren ç
and the sacrificer's life is cut short by this serious defect.
Even the act of giving dak<218>i<207><193> is a ritual.
@NT = Dak<218>i<207><193>c<193>ra
@N1 = (`the right [hand] path or conduct')
The religious practices prevalent in the modern Hindu society are ç
influenced greatly by the pur<193><207>as, the <193>gamas and the ç
tantras. The tantras are mainly works connected with the cult of <185>akti ç
or the Divine Mother.
These t<193>ntrik works present seven types of <193>c<193>ras or modes ç
of s<193>dhana. They are again regrouped into two: the Dak<218>i<207><193>c<193>ra ç

Every <193>hit<193>gni†one who ceremonially establishes the Vedic ç

is one of them. It is situated within the sacrificial shed, near the ç
main fire (the g<193>rhapatya fire), to the south (dak<218>i<207>a ç
= south). Hence this name. The fire-pit is semicircular or bow-shaped.
This fire is established in various waysamong which the following ç
are more common: brought from the g<193>rhapatya fire; from the house ç
of a vai·ya or a rich man who has established it by attrition.
It is to be preserved permanently since it protects the sacrificer ç
from evil forces. Some works consider its establishment as optional. ç
It is set up by the <193>dheya rite which is quite elaborate.
It is also called anv<193>h<193>ryapacana.

@NT = Dak<218>i<207><193>m<220>rti
@N1 = (`form [facing] south')
Though God is one, he assumes three aspects when engaged in the process ç
of s<216><218><219>i (creation), sthiti (preservation) and pralaya ç
(destruction). They are: Brahm<193>, Vi<218><207>u and <185>iva (Rudra ç
or Mahe·vara).
Out of the several forms of <185>iva described in the pur<193><207>as ç
and the <193>gamas, the Dak<218>i<207><193>m<220>rti is also one.
It is a benign aspect of his. Since he was facing south (dak<218>i<207>a ç
= south) at the time of teaching the sages in a secluded spot in the ç
Him<193>layas, he came to be known as Dak<218>i<207><193>m<220>rti. ç
Sometimes the word `dak<218>i<207><193>' is interpreted as j<210><193>na, ç
knowledge or wisdom, in which case he represents thevery personification ç
of knowledge and wisdom.
He is shown with three eyes, four arms and two legs and is seated ç
under banyan tree. Two of the hands (the front right and the front ç
left) are showing j<210><193>namudr<193> and varadamudr<193>, postures ç
ofimparting knowledge and giving gifts respectively. In the other ç
two hands†the back ones†he is holding the ak<218>am<193>l<193> (rosary) ç
and agni (fire) or a serpent. Sometimes he is pictured as playing ç
on a V<200><207><193> or lute. Other texts portray him as holding ç
a para·u (axe) and hari<207><200> (antelope) instead of the rosary ç
and fire. One of the legs is trampling upon the apasm<193>rapuru<218>a ç
(cretinous person) signifying ignorance.
The t<193>ntrik works describe him as white in complexion.
He may be shown as surrounded by several <216><218>is or sages eager ç
to learn spiritual wisdom from him.
Several forms of Dak<218>i<207><193>m<220>rti are also described in ç
the t<193>ntrik works. Some of them are: Sa<221>h<193>ra-Dak<218>i<207><193>m<220>rti, ç
Laku<219>i-Dak<218>i<207><193>m<220>rti, Medh<193>-Dak<218>i<207><193>-m<220>rti, ç
S<193>mba-Dak<218>i<207><193>m<220>rti and so on. Each one of these ç
is, iconographically speaking,  sculptured  in  a  different manner.
His worship may involve elaborate rituals. His yantra (magical diagram) ç
is a lotus with eight petals on which the deities Brahm<193>, Sarasvat<200>, ç
Ga<207>apati and some sages are inscribed.

@NT = Dak<218>i<207><193>m<220>rti Upani<218>ad
This is a short Upani<218>ad of 33 verses, assigned to the K<216><218><207>a ç
Yajurveda, but classed among the minor ones. It deals mainly with ç
the meditation on Dak<218>i<207><193>-m<220>rti, an aspect of <185>iva ç
representing a teacher of divine wisdom.
Once, a group of sages under the leadership of <185>aunaka, approached ç
the deathless sage M<193>rka<207><195>eya with due respect and asked ç
him how he had attained the ciraj<200>vatva or the deathless state ç
as also eternal bliss. He replied, `By the esoteric knowledge of the ç
principle of <185>iva.'
Then they put him nine questions:
What is that esoteric knowledge of the principle of <185>iva? Who ç
is the deity in it? Which are the mantras (spiritual formulae)? What ç
is the steadfast devotion needed? What is the means of attaining that ç
knowledge? What is its instrument? What is the offering? What is its ç
final state? What is the final abode?
The esoteric knowledge of <185>iva is the realisation of him in his ç
aspect as Dak<218>i<207><193>-m<220>rti. <185>iva is called Dak<218>i<207><193>m<220>rti ç
since he can silently give the gift (= dak<218>i<207><193>) of Self-knowledge ç
to anyone that is seen by him.
He himself is the deity (= deva) since he shines (deva = one who shines) ç
in his own glory and joy at the time of dissolution of the world.
As regards the mantras, the Upani<218>ad offers five of them:

The steadfast devotion needed is the conviction that one is Brahman, ç
which should last till the death of the body.
The means of attaining that know-ledge is the repetition of the mantra ç
(oneof the five already given) with the conscious thinking that one ç
is identical with the deity denoted by the mantra.
The instrument is singular devotion to the mantra.
Offering is the offering of the movement of one's limbs as worship ç
to the deity of the mantra.
The final state is the attainment of the perfect equanimity of the ç
three gu<207>as.
And, the final abode is the heart or the sahasr<193>ra (thousand-petalled ç
lotus in the crown of the head) which are the places for the realisation ç
of the Self.
The Upani<218>ad ends with the eulogy that one who learns this esoteric ç
wisdom is freed from all sins and attains liberation from transmigration.

@NT = Dak<218>i<207>e·vara
Visiting a famous place of pilgrimage at least once in a life-time ç
has been a great ambition cherished by all devout Hindus. And, such ç
places of pilgrimage are legion in Hinduism. Many of these pilgrim ç
centres have acquired their importance due to their intimate association ç
with great saints and religious leaders.
One such place, of a rather recent origin, is Dak<218>i<207>e·vara, ç
now a part of the city of Calcutta. Due to its close connection with ç
the life of <185>r<200> R<193>mak<216><218><207>a (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1836- ç
1886) it is now attracting thousands of votaries and visitors throughout ç
the year.
As one enters the temple complex from the riverside through the landing ç
gh<193><219> on the eastern bank of the Ganges river, one comes to ç
the main portico called `C<193>ndni'. On either side of it are the ç
<185>iva temples six to the north and six to the south. They are all ç
identical. One has to cross the open courtyard to reach the temple ç
of K<193>l<200>, the main shrine.
Built by R<193><207><200> R<193>sama<207>i (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1793-1861), ç
a rich landlady, in 1855, this temple of K<193>l<200> is the central ç
attraction of this place. The goddess is known as `Bhava-t<193>ri<207><200>', ç
`redeemer from the sufferings of the world'. The image has been carved ç
out of a single piece of basalt and faces south. The deity is standing ç
on the chest of <185>iva (her spouse) who lies prostrate on a thousand-petalled ç
silver lotus. The height of the image is 85 cms. (33.5 inches) and ç
the shrine-room is 4.5 metres (15 ft.) square excluding the raised ç
plinth and the overall height is more than 33 metres (100ft.).
Open on all sides and facing the main shrine is the N<193><219>mandir ç
(literally, `dance-hall') measuring 22.5 metres (75 ft.) by 15 metres ç
(50 ft.). It is meant for meditation and religio-cultural activities ç
like devotional music, dramas and dances with religious themes.
Behind the temple of K<193>l<200> stands another temple dedicated ç
to K<216><218><207>a in his R<193>dh<193>k<193>nta aspect. The images ç
of K<216><218><207>a and R<193>dh<193> are 55 cms. (21.5 inches) and ç
40 cms. (16 inches) respectively.

room, Nahabat and Bakultala gh<193><219>, the Pa<210>cava<219><200> ç
and the Bel tree as also the small cottage or meditation hut.
<185>r<200> R<193>mak<216><218><207>a spent nearly thirty years of ç
his life in that room. The room is about 7 metres (24 ft.) square. ç
The two wooden cots†one smaller than the other† which he was using ç
have been preserved. The room opens on to a semicircular verandah ç
to the west which faces the Ganges river.
The Nahabat or music tower is to the north of <185>r<200> R<193>mak<216><218><207>a's ç
room and has anoctagonal room on the ground-floor measuring 2.3 metres ç
(7.75 ft.) across. The entrance door is hardly 1.2 metres (4 ft.) ç
in height. <185>r<200> S<193>rad<193> Dev<200> (better known as the ç
Holy Mother) lived in this room. Candr<193>dev<200>, mother of <185>r<200> ç
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, lived on the first floor.
The Bakultala-gh<193><219> is the bathing gh<193><219> (close to the ç
Nahabat) of the Ganges river, which <185>r<200> S<193>rad<193> Dev<200> ç
used to use.
The Pa<210>cava<219><200> is a grove of five sacred trees intended ç
as a place for spiritual practices. It was renovated by <185>r<200> ç
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a himself.
The Bel tree which is a little away from the Pa<210>cava<219><200> ç
is the very tree under which <185>r<200> R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
practised severe t<193>ntric disciplines guided by Bhairav<200> Br<193>hma<207><200>.
The small cottage is the very meditation room where the great saint ç

@NT = dama
@N1 = (`control')
All the Hindu philosophical systems which accept the authority of ç
the Vedas, posit mok<218>a or liberation from transmigratory existence, ç
as the final goal of life. This becomes possible only when one realises ç
one's real nature as the <193>tman, the Self, of the nature of pure ç
consciousness, totally different from the body-mind complex. This, ç
again, involves a lot of spiritual struggle wherein one has to conquer ç
the pulls and pushes of the powerful sense-organs and sense-objects. ç
`Dama' is the technical term given to this aspect of spiritual discipline, ç
by the Ved<193>ntic treatises, especially the Upani<218>ads and the ç
Bhagavadg<200>t<193>.
It is generally defined as restraining and pulling back the external ç
sense-organs like the eyes and the ears from all those objects which ç
do not aid the meditation on the <193>tman, but try to distract and ç
disturb the mind.

@NT = <195>amaru
@N1 = (`a small drum')
Pictures and images of <185>iva (one of the major forms of God in ç
Hinduism) show him as holding the tri·<220>la (trident) and the <195>amaru ç
(a small drum) in his hands.
The <195>amaru which is a folk or tribal musical instrument of the ç
percussion type, is in extensive use even now in the rural parts of ç
India, especially by the folk- dancers and priests of the t<193>ntrik ç
tradition. It is a sort of kettle-drum, very small in size. It is ç
made of two inverted bowls of wood or clay, the open ends being covered ç
with parchment or thin leather. Strings with beads at their ends are ç
attached to the slender middle portion. When the drum is rhythmically ç
shaken by hand, a pleasant rattling sound is produced, as the beads ç
strike the membrane on the open ends.
In the images of <185>iva (especially the dancing ones like Na<219>ar<193>ja) ç
the <195>amaru is held in the upper right hand.
According  to  some  mythological accounts, <185>iva, at the request ç
of the gods in heaven, is said to have danced with power and grace†a ç
rare combination indeed†using the <195>amaru and soundingit fourteen ç
times. Each time, the sound that emerged, formed a specific pattern, ç
giving rise to the fourteen basic aphorisms of Sanskrit grammar (called ç
M<193>he·vara-s<220>tras, like `a-i-u<207>,' `<216>-l<216>k' and ç
so on). Consequently the symbolical meaning of the <195>amaru in <185>iva's ç
hand is sound or alphabets or grammar or language. It may also represent ç
the <193>k<193>·a or the ether principle, the first of the five basic ç
elements in the process of creation of the world.

@NT = d<193>na
@N1 = (`gift')
Giving gifts to worthy persons has been considered as a meritorious ç
act of great value by all the important religions of the world. The ç
most common Sanskrit word for giving gifts is `d<193>na.'
Having had its origin in the <184>gveda itself, the concept has ç
gradually evolved to an astonishing degree of details as also finesse ç
over the centuries. It has been extolled as equal to tapas or austerity ç
and as a primary religious duty of this Kaliyuga or Iron-age.
The concept first appears in the <184>gveda (1.125.6) as dak<218>i<207><193> ç
or sacrificial fee to be paid to the priests and the giftsof cows ç
and gold to deserving persons. Anna- d<193>na or giving food to hungry ç
beings has also been extolled there highly (10.117).
The Upani<218>ads describe d<193>na as a religious duty and as a discipline ç
that helps one to conquer one's greedy nature. The Bhagavadg<200>t<193> ç
(16.1; 17.20-22) calls it as a divine quality and classifies it into ç
three categories.
However, it is in the dharma·<193>stras (independent compendiums on ç
the various aspects of dharma, as related to var<207>a and <193>·rama) ç
and the pur<193><207>as that the meticulously worked out details about ç
d<193>na are met with.
D<193>na may be nitya (obligatory dailyduty),  naimittika  (occasional),  k<193>mya ç
(desire-motivated) or vimala (pure). Giving food to hungry beings ç
as a part of daily duties, gifting of useful things on special occasions ç
like the periods of eclipses, presenting cows or other prescribed ç
things as a part of rituals performed with desires and donations conferred ç
upon persons of saintly character with the sole object of pleasing ç
God are, respectively, the examples for these four categories mentioned ç
above.
@SPACE1 = 
Apart from this, it is also emphasised that d<193>na should be given ç
unostentatiously and unknown to others.
Since d<193>na has been considered as a religious act and has also ç
acquired a ritualistic colour, certain rules and regulations, some ç
formalities, have come to be associated with the same.
The d<193>t<193> or the giver of gifts must be free from incurable ç
diseases and heinous sins, be virtuous and clean, and must have acquired ç
his wealth by right means.
The receiver must really be in need of what he is asking for, and ç
these may be basic things required for a living like food, clothing, ç
shelter or money. Persons of evil or doubtful character like gamblers, ç
cheats, drunkards or criminals should not be helped with gifts.
It is essential that the giver must have ·raddh<193> or faith in the ç
act of giving as religious or meritorious. It is this that really ç
matters and not the quality or the quantity, though a minimum standard ç
is expected to make it really useful.
The   dharma·<193>stras   vehemently oppose the gifts made by persons ç
who have amassed wealth by unrighteous means. The receiver too should ç
never accept them if he knows about it!
A householder should never give gifts beyond his means and should ç
not make his family and dependents suffer on account of it. Generally ç
ten per cent of the earnings is given as the limit for giving gifts.
Mention is also made of certain things which should not be given nor ç
accepted as gifts. No one can gift away things that do not rightfully ç
belong to him†as for instance, things that have been borrowed from ç
others or kept in one's safe keeping!
@SPACE1 = 
Similarly there are restrictions with regard to accepting things if ç
they are against one's svadharma or sense of righteousness and prescribed ç
duties. For example, a br<193>hma<207>a devoted to Vedic learning ç
and a purely spiritual life, should not accept weapons or intoxicating ç
substances even if offered.
The religious works prescribe certain periods or times as very auspicious ç
for giving gifts. Among them are the two solstices (summer and winter), ç
days of eclipses of the sun and the moon, new-moon and full-moon days ç
as also important festival days.
Gifts given in places of pilgrimage are also extolled highly.
Objects once given away as a gift should never be taken back. This ç
applies even to promises of gifts.
Gifts given by mentally deranged persons or those suffering from very ç
serious illnesses or immature young children are considered invalid ç
for obvious reasons.
The dharma·<193>stras and the pur<193><207>as eulogise certain special ç
gifts like god<193>na (gift of cows) and suvar<207>ad<193>na (gift ç
of gold) as also tul<193>puru<218>a (weighing a person against the ç
things to be gifted and then give them away).
Gift of knowledge, especially spiritual wisdom,  has  been  considered  as  the ç
highest and the best gift.
@SPACE1 = 
To summarise: (a) Giving d<193>na or gifts is a sacred act that helps ç
one to earn religious merit. (b) One can give gifts only from what ç
one has earned by right means. (c) One should never give beyond one's ç
means and capacity. (d) Things given should be useful to the donee. ç
(e) Rules concerning time, place and occasion should be observed as ç
far as possible.

@EMERGEN1 = These `anti-gods' or evil beings are described by various ç

@N1LS = (`[that] by which punishment is [meted out];' `[that] by which ç
control [is exercised].')
The word `da<207><195>a' is one of the commonest terms that we come ç
across inthe dharma·<193>stras and allied works. Etymologically, ç
it means anything by which  control  is  exercised,  including punishment.
In its simplest form it means a stick or a rod. The stick that a Vedic ç
student or an itinerant monk keeps constantly with him for protection ç
in emergencies is a `da<207><195>a'. It also acts as a symbol of self-control.
In the pur<193><207>as, it is the rod of death or punishment, in the ç
hands of Yama, the god of death. Consequently he is also called `da<207><195>adhara' ç
or the wielder of the da<207><195>a.
A da<207><195>a can also be in the form of a long staff, a cudgel ç
or a stick often unornamented, and is shown in the hands of some images ç
like those of K<193>rttikeya (or Subrahma<207>ya), the minor deities ç
such as Ma<209>gala, <185>ukra and <185>ani (planet- deities), Kapila ç
and even the goddess Rati (wife of K<193>madeva or cupid).
As applied to a king it can mean the armed forces, one of the seven ç
r<193>jy<193><209>gas or constituents of a State. As one of the four ç
`up<193>yas' or means of achieving the desired end, especially while ç
dealing with hostile kings, it means war, but as a last resort.
The word is sometimes used as a unit of time, an equivalent of `gha<219>ik<193>,' ç
and is equal to 24 minutes.

@N1 = (`cleansing with a stick')
Standard works on Ha<219>hayoga like the Ghera<207><195>a Sa<221>hit<193> ç
give various cleansing processes, generally called `dhauti', to purify ç
the body and make it healthy and strong. It is only such a healthy ç
body that is fit to practise other forms of yoga like R<193>jayoga.
The da<207><195>adhauti is one such process and is one of three classed ç
under h<216>d-dhauti. (See <MS>H<184>DDHAUTI <D>also.)
The yogi takes the plantain stalk or the stalk of a turmeric plant ç
or cane and thrusts it slowly into the esophagus and then draws it ç
out slowly. By this process the phlegm, bile and other impurities ç
are expelled out of the mouth.

Da<207><195>aka was one of the hundred princes, sons of the king Ik<218>v<193>ku, ç

that the sa<221>ny<193>sin has to be ever vigilant to practise dama ç

Sanskrit or sa<221>sk<216>ta is not only an ancient language but also ç
very rich in its various aspects of grammar, poetics and literature. ç
Da<207><195>in (6th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) was one of the earliest ç
writers on poetics. He probably lived in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. ç
Three works are attributed to<|>him: K<193>vy<193>dar·<%10>a <D%0>(poetics), ç
Da·a-kum<193>racarita (a collection of romantic tales) and Chandoviciti ç
(prosody).

@NT = dantadh<193>vana
@N1 = (`cleaning the teeth')
Hindu sages were very particular about personal hygiene since cleanliness ç
of the body and the surroundings was conducive to the cleanliness ç
and peace of mind. Hence, the writers of the dharma-·<193>stras have ç
dealt with this aspect of one's life†generally grouped under the titles ç
<193>hnika and <193>c<193>ra†in meticulous detail.
Dantadh<193>vana or cleaning one's teeth is one of the earliest acts ç
in one's daily routine. It is generally done with a small piece of ç
a twig with its bark, taken from certain specified plants or trees ç
(having medicinal properties) after shaping it like a toothbrush by ç
crushing one of its ends. It is interesting to note that even this ç
simple act of cleaning one's teeth has to be accompanied by the chanting ç
of certain mantras, the main purport of which is prayer for a long ç
life, health and strength as also good memory and intelligence.
It is to be repeated, though in a modified form, in the night also.
@NT = dantadhauti
@N1 = (`cleansing of the teeth')
Works on Ha<219>hayoga like the Ghera<207><195>asa<221>hit<193> ç
describe certain processes for cleansing the body known as `dhautis' ç
to make it fit for R<193>jayoga. One such is the dantadhauti, aimed ç
at cleansing the teeth, the root of the tongue, the two holes of the ç
ear and the sinuses.
The practical process has to be learnt directly under the guidance ç
of a competent teacher.

@NT = Dantavakra
@N1KERN = (`One with mis-shaped teeth')
@SPACE1 = 
Also spelt as Dantavaktra (`One whose mouth is full of teeth,' i.e., ç
one with protruded teeth) was the prince of the country of Kar<220><218>a ç
(in Kali<209>ga, identi-fied with the modern Orissa). He was a nephew ç
of Vasudeva, father of <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a. Being a close ç
friend of <185>i·up<193>la who blasphemed <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a ç
during the R<193>jas<220>ya sacrifice of the P<193><207><195>avas ç
and got killed by him, he invaded Dv<193>rak<193> along with his another ç
friend S<193>lva. However, he was killed by <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a ç
in the duel. At the time of his death, a light emerged out of his ç
body and got merged in <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a. This is because ç
he was actually Jaya (one of the two gate keepers of Vaiku<207><219>ha) ç
reborn as Dantavakra due to the curse of the sages, Sanatkum<193>ra ç
and others.

@NT = darbha
@N1 = (`that which cuts asunder')
Right from the Vedic times certain varieties of grass like the darbha ç
have been considered as sacred and have been used in the sacrificial ç
rites. Since a dry piece of this grass can cut our skin (d<216> = ç
to cut) it might have got this name. Sometimes it has been identified ç
with the ku·a grass and sometimes described as different. But in today's ç
ritualistic practices the two names refer to the same (ku·a) grass.
In the Atharvaveda (6.43) it is mentioned that it can be used as ç
an amulet for protection against certain evils.
Works on the °yurveda predicate several uses to this grass such as ç
appetising, purification of blood and semen, curing of certain diseases ç
like jaundice and herpes.
The botanical names given for this grass are: Saccharum cylindricum ç
or Poa cynosuroides.

@NT = darpa<207>a
@N1 = (`[that] which increases one's pride')
@SPACE1 = 
The word `darpa<207>a' is one of the common terms that indicates a ç
mirror. It has been so called since it increases the `darpa' or the ç
pride of a beautiful or a handsome person!
