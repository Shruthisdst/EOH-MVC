Great saints have been the `salt of the earth' in India. Narration ç
of their lives has been considered as an act of great religious merit.
It goes to the credit of N<193>bh<193>d<193>sa that he has preserved ç
for the posterity, the detailed lives of about two hundred minstrels ç
of God, in his now well-known book Bhaktam<193>l<193> or Bhaktam<193>lik<193>.
Born perhaps in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1657 at the village R<193>ma-bhadr<193>cala, ç
on the bank of the river God<193>var<200> (in Andhra Pradesh) to R<193>mad<193>sa, ç
himself a great devotee of R<193>ma, he lost his father at an early ç
age and was abandoned by his mother due to extreme poverty. The child ç
was adopted by one Agrad<193>sa, by name, belonging to Galat<193> ç
near Jaipur (in Rajasthan). Agrad<193>sa too seems to have been a ç
saint and is said to have initiated the child into the cult of devotion ç
to R<193>ma, with the new name `N<193>bh<193>d<193>sa,' the original ç
name being N<193>r<193>ya<207>ad<193>sa.
N<193>bh<193>d<193>sa was well-educated and endowed with great poetical ç
talents. He was also a humble devotee of God.
His work Bhaktam<193>l<193> is written in Hindi (Brajbh<193><218><193>) ç
poetry in the metre called `Chappa' (with six lines). The language ç
is elegant though full of Sanskrit words.
@EMERGENCY = There are many commentaries on this work as also several ç
other Bhaktam<193>l<193>s by other writers, who have kept this work ç
as their model.
@NT = N<193>bh<193>nedi<218><219>ha
@N1 = (`nearest in birth or<R>ç

@EMERGENCY = The <184>gveda is the oldest scripture in the world. ç
One of the important <216><218>is or sages of this Veda to whom are ç
attributed 38 <216>ks (<184>gvedic mantras) (10.61.1-27; 10.62.1-11) ç
is N<193>bh<193>nedi<218><219>ha. He was the last son of the sage ç
Manu.
There is an interesting story about him (vide Aitareya Br<193>hma<207>a ç
22.14 and Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> 3.1.9.4 to 7). When he ç
was in the gurukula for education, his elder brothers divided all ç
the paternal property among themselves leaving nothing for him! After ç
he returned home, he requested his father Manu for his share of the ç
property. Manu asked him to go to the sage A<209>giras who was performing ç
a Sattray<193>ga but did not know the mantras to be chanted on the ç
sixth day. N<193>bh<193>ne-di<218><219>ha, who knew these mantras, ç
could offer his services, win his confidence, as also plenty of money ç
(or property).
Everything happened as Manu had predicted. However, when N<193>bh<193>nedi<218><219>ha ç
was about to take the thousand cows given to him by the sage A<209>giras, ç
Rudra (<185>iva) appeared on the scene and claimed them as his, as ç
per the rules of Vedic sacrifices. When Manu, who was apprised of ç
this, concurred with Rudra and N<193>bh<193>nedi<218><219>ha told ç
him the truth, Rudra was pleased with his devotion to truth and gave ç
away all the cows. According to another version, the sage pleased ç
Rudra by performing a ritual called `Manthisa<221>sr<193>va.'
@NT = N<193>bhi
He was the son of the king °gn<200>dhra and Vipracitti. Priyavrata ç
was his grandfather. His wife was Merudev<200> and the great king ç
<184><218>abha was his son and successor.
The kingdom (or the country) ruled by him came to be known as N<193>bhivar<218>a ç
or Ajan<193>bhavar<218>a, same as Bh<193>ratavar<218>a.

@SPACE = 
In the story of Naciketas as described in the Ka<219>ha Upani<218>ad, ç
the second boon that the young boy Naciketas asked from Yama, the ç
god of death, was about the sacrifice (in fire) that could help one ç
to attain svarga or heaven after death.
Yama taught him the same, in all its details and tested him at the ç
end, just to know whether he had rightly comprehended this difficult ç
subject. When he got excellent answers Yama was so pleased with Naciketas ç
that he christened the sacrifice itself and the main fire in it, as ç
`N<193>ciket<193>gni.'
The details of the sacrifice, however, are not known.

Though the word `n<193>da' is generally used in the sense of sound†both ç
unmanifest and manifest†it has been employed more as a technical term ç
in <185>aivism and the <185><193>kta-tantras.
Before creation, the <185>iva-<185>akti principle†the ultimate Reality†is ç
one only, without a second. When this Reality†the equivalent of Brahman ç
of the Advaita Ved<193>nta†starts reflecting on Itself (which is called ç
`vimar<218>a') a throb or a stir is created. This stir named as spanda, ç
develops further as `n<193>da' or vibration, and gets concentrated ç
as `bindu' (point of tremendous energy). Further creation evolves ç
out of it.
When the word is taken to mean sound, several varieties of it are ç
described in the technical works related to music and yogic practices. ç
For instance: gha<207><219><193>n<193>da (sound of a bell); ·a<209>khan<193>da ç
(sound of a conch); bher<200>n<193>da (sound of a kettle-drum); ve<207>un<193>da ç

so on.
@SPACE = 
@NT = N<193>dabind<220>pani<218>ad
@SPACE = 
This is a minor Upani<218>ad in 53 verses and has been assigned to ç
the <184>gveda.
It starts with a description of the Pra<207>ava or O<209>k<193>ra ç
as a bird with the four syllables (a, u, m and the ardham<193>tr<193>, ç
the unmanifest last half-syllable) forming the various parts of its ç
body. Similarly the threegu<207>as, dharma (righteousness) and adharma ç
(unrighteousness), the seven lokas or worlds (from bh<220><199> or ç
earth up to Brahmaloka or the world of Brahm<193>) are also described ç
as the various parts of this bird.
An adept in yoga who rides this ha<221>sa or swan, will not be affected ç
bythe k<193>rmic effects of even millions of births.
Then  comes  a  description  of meditation on the four syllables of ç
the Pra<207>ava or O<209>k<193>ra. They should be considered as related ç
to the deities Agni (fire-god), V<193>yu (wind-god), Bh<193>nu (sun-god) ç
and Varu<207>a (god of the oceans and water).
Each of the four m<193>tras can be subdivided into three parts (either ç
depending on time as past, present and future, or the mode of uttering ç
it as ud<193>tta [medium tone or scale], anud<193>tta [one scale below] ç
and svarita [one scale above]). This makes the total twelve. Each ç
of these is given a particular name like gho<218>i<207><200>, vidyunm<193>tra, ç
pata<209>gin<200> and so on.
The next group of verses gives the result of leaving the body at the ç
time of uttering any one of these twelve aspects of Pra<207>ava. For ç
instance, one who dies while contemplating upon the first m<193>tr<193> ç
is born again as an emperor. If it is on the fourth, he will attain ç
the world of the gandharvas. If on the ninth, he will be reborn in ç
the Maharloka, and so on.
@SPACE1 = 
Then, the Upani<218>ad describes the result of getting the mind dissolved ç
in the Supreme <185>iva. He is rid of all bondages and attains the ç
ever-blissful Brahman.
After this the Upani<218>ad discusses whether the j<210><193>ni (the ç
realised soul) has pr<193>rabdhakarma (the karma responsible for this ç
birth) or not. The conclusion is that though it is there, he does ç
not feel it, since the whole life is like a dream to him.
Now comes a description of the yogi sitting in the siddh<193>sana ç
(a posturespecially recommended for meditation) with vai<218><207>av<200>mudr<193> ç
(keeping the eyelids without blinking, the eyes apparently seeing ç
outside, but the mind withdrawn inside). The yogi is then able to ç
hear the internal sound through the right ear. He should concentrate ç
on this so that he becomes deaf as it were, to all external sounds.
In this s<193>dhan<193> or practice, he will hear many types of sound ç
similar to those of ocean waves, kettle-drums, bell and horn. Then ç
he may hear the sounds similar to the tinkling of bells, flute, humming ç
of bees and so on. However, he should shift his concentration from ç
gross sounds to subtler sounds. Merging of the mind totally in such ç
sounds gives him the realisation of cid<193>k<193>·a or the pure consciousness ç
in the space of the heart.
The Pra<207>ava (O<209>k<193>ra) is Brahman which, again, is full ç
of effulgence (of pure consciousness). When the mind is dissolved ç
in this, the yogi is fully liberated and is† as if†dead to the phenomenal ç
world.
The Upani<218>ad ends with a short description of the mukta-puru<218>a ç
(liberated soul) which is similar to such descriptions given in the ç
Bhagavadg<200>t<193>.
@SPACE = 
@NT = n<193>d<193>nusandh<193>na

good for meditation) and practising the ·<193>mbhav<200>mudr<193> ç
(intent gazing at a minute object until tears flow)the yogi should ç
hear the n<193>da or sound produced by sa<221>yama (perfect concentration) ç
(vide Yogas<220>tras 3.4) on the su<218>umn<193>.
This n<193>d<193>nusandh<193>na has four stages all of which have ç

It leads to complete control over the mind and the senses.
@NT = nad<200>
@N1 = (`[water that flows] by making sound,' `river')
Rivers have always been looked upon, in the Hindu scriptures, with ç
awe and reverence. They have also been†at least the major ones†deified ç
and accepted as goddesses. This may be because they are sources of ç
life-giving water (not only for drinking but also for raising crops). ç
Again, their banks provided the <216><218>is and munis (sages) with ç
a congenial place for practising austerities. This might have led ç
to the belief that bathing in them purifies not only the body but ç
also the mind.
The <184>gveda itself mentions 20 rivers by name (vide 5.53.9; ç
10.64.9; 10.75.5,6) and refers to another 99 flowing rivers later ç
(10.104.8).
If a flowing water has to be called a `nad<200>' or river it had to ç
be at least of a length of 8000 dhanus (14.4 kms.).
Only the nad<200>s that flowed directly into the sea were considered ç
holy or pure enough for taking a bath.
In the <184>gveda (10.75.5-6) there is a Nad<200>stuti, a eulogy ç
of seven important rivers. They are: Ga<209>g<193>, Yamun<193>, Sarasvat<200>, ç
<185>utudr<200>, Paru<218><207><200>, Marudv<216>dh<193> and °rj<200>k<200>y<193>.
In this verse itself, three more rivers are also mentioned: Asikn<200>, ç
Vitast<193> and Su<218>om<193>.
The rivers Ga<209>g<193> and Yamun<193> are very much there even now ç
and command great reverence from the Hindus.
Sarasvat<200>, once a mighty river, is believed to have disappeared ç
underground, probably around 2000 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>

The <184>gveda also mentions the Sapta-sindh<220>s (seven great ç
rivers) vide 1.32.12; 1.34.8; 4.28.1; 10.43.3) which are the same ç
as the Sindh<220> (Indus), Sarasvat<200> and the five rivers of Punjab.
Even in the modern days, seven rivers are highly venerated and their ç
presence invoked into the water used for p<220>j<193> orritualistic ç
worship. They are: Ga<209>g<193>, Yamun<193>, God<193>var<200>, Sarasvat<200>, ç
Narmad<193>, Sindh<220> and K<193>ver<200>.
Water is the greatest gift of God to living beings. Rivers and lakes ç
are the lifeline of a nation. According to the pur<193><207>as, a ç
sage Tundila by name, worshipped <185>iva, the great God, and became ç
one of his aspects, viz., water. He came to be called Pu<218>kara ç
or Water-god. When Brahm<193> created this world he took the help ç
of Pu<218>kara, as also B<216>haspati, the sage-preceptor of the gods. ç
According to the arrangement arrived at among them, whenever B<216>haspati ç
(represented by the planet Guru or Jupiter) enters a particular zodiacal ç
sign, a particular river becomes a `Pu<218>kara,' charged with the ç
divine power of all the gods. This happens once in 12 years for each ç
of the twelve rivers mentioned in the pur<193><207>as. And, that power ç
will last for 12days. So, whosoever takesa dip in that river at ç
its pu<218>kara-period, is benefited immensely in the spiritual sense.

The word n<193><195><200> has been used in various senses. Generally ç
it means either a duct or a nerve.
Some of the Upani<218>ads (vide Ch<193>ndogya 8.6.6; Ka<219>ha ç
6.16) speak of 101 n<193><195><200>s proceeding from the heart out ç
of which one (the s<220>ryan<193><195><200>) passes through the brahmarandhra ç
(aperture in the crown of the head). If the j<200>va (the soul) leaves ç
the body through this, he passes through the arcir<193>dim<193>rga ç
or devay<193>na (the bright path, the path of gods) and reaches Brahmaloka, ç
the world of Brahm<193>, from which there is no return.
The number of n<193><195><200>s as per different sources varies from ç
3,50,000 to 72,000, out of which only fourteen are considered as principal. ç
Some of them are: i<195><193>, pi<209>gal<193>,  su<218>umn<193>,  g<193>ndh<193>r<200>,  kuh<220>, ç

Snake-worship seems to be a very ancient custom. Images of snake-couples ç
have been unearthed in the Indus Valley Civilisation. Worship of snakes ç
is said to have existed in ancient Greece, Egypt and Assyria.
According to the pur<193><207>as, snakes (serpent-gods) are the offsprings ç
of the sage Ka·yapa and his wife Kadr<220>. Names of the famous great ç
serpents which were their original progeny are: Ananta (or <185>e<218>a), ç
V<193>suki, Tak<218>aka, K<193>rko<219>aka, Padma,   Mah<193>padma,   <185>a<209>khap<193>la, ç
Dhana<210>jaya and Kulika.
Snakes and serpents find an important place in our mythological literature. ç
If Vi<218><207>u is comfortably reclining on it in the ocean of milk, ç
<185>iva wears it all over his body as ornaments! If Ga<207>apati ç
wears it as yaj<210>opav<200>ta (sacred thread) and uses another as ç
his belt to keep his belly in position,   his   brother   Subrahma<207>ya ç
considers it as his another form.
The works on yoga compare the ku<207><195>alin<200> power to a coiled ç
serpent.
Snakes are worshipped for obtaining wealth and children, for long-life ç
and for escaping from snake-bites.
Establishing relief figures of snakes, especially under the a·vattha ç
trees (Ficus religiosa), is considered as a sacred act bringing ç
religious merit. Killing of snakes, that too of cobras, is considered ç
as heinous and sinful. Dead snakes are cremated with religious honours.
N<193>gas or snakes are a familiar motif in temple sculpture.
Elaborate rituals connected with N<193>gama<207><195>alas, where complicated ç
designs are drawn and worshipped, are found in certain parts of India, ç
especially in the west-coastal region of South.
Sarpabali  or  offerings  to  snakes involving elaborate rituals, ç

freedom from dangers, especially from snakebite. Figures of snakes ç
are drawn on the walls on either side of the main entrance door, with ç
cowdung, and worship is offered to them. The same may be done to figures ç
of snakes drawn with red sandal paste on wooden boards also. Images ç
used in worship for bathing may be made of metal or clay. Worship ç
should include karav<200>ra flowers, incense and the food offering ç
of p<193>yasa (pudding). Inviting the snake-charmers and feeding their ç
snakes with milk is common on this day.

@NT = N<193>g<193>rjuna
Two N<193>g<193>rjunas are known to history though, sometimes, they ç
are considered as one and the same person.
The  first  N<193>g<193>rjuna  might  have existed during the period ç
1st century <MS>B.C.<D> to 1st century <MS>A.<|>D.<D> (15 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>†<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
75). Born into a br<193>hma<207>a family, he got converted to Buddhism, ç
by A·vagho<218>a or Saraha. He was first known as Praj<210><193>dhara ç
and later as N<193>g<193>rjuna. He was the founder of the M<193>dhyamika ç
school of Buddhism. He wrote the M<193>dhyamika K<193>rik<193> as ç
the basic work of this school. The place where he lived with his disciples ç
and died is the N<193>g<193>rjuna Ko<207><195>a area of Andhra Pradesh ç
in the district of Guntur. It is now submerged under the water of ç
N<193>g<193>rjuna S<193>gara.
The second N<193>g<193>rjuna lived in the 6th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
and belonged to the Karnataka State. He was the son of one P<193>daliptas<220>ri ç
and a great scholar of Jainism, Ved<193>nta and °yurveda. He later ç
on embraced Buddhism and was the head of a monastery in Tibet for ç
a few years.
He was an expert in rasavidy<193> (a branch of °yurveda, using mercury ç
as the main ingredient of medicines).
Later in life he settled down in <185>r<200>·ailam of Andhra Pradesh ç
where he perfected his rasavidy<193>. His works on this science are: ç
Rasakacchapu<219>a and Kak<218>a-pu<219>atantra (or Siddhac<193>mu<207><195>a).
@NT = N<193>gas
One of the wives of Arjuna, the P<193><207><195>ava hero, was Ul<220>p<200>, ç
a N<193>ga princess. Obviously, the N<193>gas must have been a prominent ç
race of human beings. They might have derived their name either because ç
they were worshippers of snake-gods or had the snake as their national ç
symbol.
The pur<193><207>as describe them as the offsprings of the sage Ka·yapa ç
and his wife Kadr<220> and often identified with snakes.
The N<193>gas of the mythical period lived in the subterranean world ç
called Ras<193>tala. Their capital was Bhogavat<200>, a beautiful ç
city.
During the historical period, two royal families of N<193>gas have ç
been known to exist. They are: the Chindakas who ruled from Cakrako<219><219>a ç
(Bastar of Madhya Pradesh) (11th to 14th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>); the ç
Sindas of Karnataka (circa <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 750), who called their land ç
as Sindav<193><195>i.
The N<193>gas of modern India are a group of tribals inhabiting the ç
N<193>ga Hill ranges of Nagaland in the north-east. They include more ç
than 20 tribes of mixed origin and varying cultures. They differ in ç
physical appearance too. Their dialects belong  to  the  Sino-Tibetan  group  of ç
languages.  English,  Hind<200>  or  broken Assamese is the common ç
language for all.
The largest tribes are the Konyak, Ao, Tanghkul, Sema and Angami.
Most of them live in small villages placed on hill-sides and located ç
near water.
Rice and millets are the staple food. Weaving and wood-carving are ç
the main sources of income.
A tribal council of elders rules over the tribes.
A sizeable section of the N<193>gas are christians.

N<193>goji Bha<219><219>a (also called N<193>ge·a Bha<219><219>a) ç
lived in the early part of the 18thcentury. He was the son of <185>iva ç
Bha<219><219>a and Sat<200>. The famous Bha<219><219>oji D<200>k<218>ita ç
(author of the monumental work on Sanskrit grammar, the Siddh<193>nta ç
Kaumud<200>) was his grandfather. A br<193>hma<207>a from Maharashtra, ç
he lived mostly at <185><216><209>gaverapura near Allahabad, as a ç
protege of a chieftain, R<193>ma of the Bisena family.
His great erudition has been reflected in his various writings, profuse ç
in quantity and excellent in quality. Apart from grammar and poetics ç
he was also an expert in the field of dharma·<193>stras.
Some of his works are: several treatises ending with the word `indu·ekhara' ç
such  as  °c<193>rendu·ekhara,  T<200>rthendu- ·ekhara, Pr<193>ya·cittendu·ekhara ç

@NT = Nahu<218>a
There cannot be a better example than that of emperor Nahu<218>a to ç
show that power and wealth, honour and valour can corrupt the minds ç
of even good and great persons.
Nahu<218>a, the grandson of the well-known emperor Pur<220>rava of ç
Candrava<221>·a (lunar lineage), was a great emperor of pure character. ç
When Indra the king of the gods in heaven, quietly disappeared because  of  the  sin  of  brahmahaty<193> ç
(incurred by killing V<216>tr<193>sura), all the gods of heaven went ç
to the four-faced creator Brahm<193> and appealed to him for giving ç
them someone to rule over heaven.
Brahm<193> suggested that the emperor Nahu<218>a be brought from the ç
bh<220>loka (earth). Though Nahu<218>a was unwilling to shoulder that ç
responsibility first, he later on yielded to their importunities.
As he sat on the throne of Indra and started tasting the power, luxuries ç
and glory, his mind gradually got corrupted by the sinful desire of ç
having <185>ac<200>dev<200> (wife of Indra) as his wife. Meanwhile ç
Indra had been liberated from his sin through proper expiation and ç
was getting ready to return.
When <185>ac<200>dev<200> got the message of Nahu<218>a, she cleverly ç
worked out a strategy by which Nahu<218>a could get into trouble. ç
Driven by fate as it were, Nahu<218>a ordered the Saptar<218>is to ç
carry his palanquin to <185>ac<200>dev<200>'s palace. On the way, ç
blinded by lust, he kicked the sage Agastya (one of the seven sages) ç
urging him with the words, `sarpa! sarpa!' (`Move quickly!'). No sooner ç
did Agastya hear these words and get the kick, than he cursed him, ç
`Become a sarpa (serpent!)' Nahu<218>a immediately fell down from ç
the palanquin as a python.
@SPACE1 = 
Once, Bh<200>ma, the second of the P<193><207><195>ava princes, was ç

viz., that he should answer its queries. Bh<200>ma could neither answer ç
them nor could extricate himself by his own prowess. Finally, Yudhi<218><219>hira, ç
his elder brother, who came there, answered them satisfactorily thereby ç
getting him released. The python too was transformed into the emperor ç
Nahu<218>a who left immediately for heaven.

he is said to have set a wheel rolling and told them that the place ç
where the nemi or the rim of the wheel will drop off, is the most ç

as Naimi<218>a (or Naimi·a) or Naimi<218><193>ra<207>ya.
It was on the right bank of the river Gomat<200>.
It is now identified with N<200><221>sar, about 40 kms. (24 miles) ç
from the railway station Sondilla in Uttar Pradesh.
The pur<193><207>as mention it as a place where many Vedic sacrifices ç

@NT = nai<218>karmya
@N1 = (`state of absence of all karmas or rituals and actions')
This is a technical term generally favoured by the Advaita Ved<193>nta ç
system. In effect, it means the state of j<200>vanmukti or liberation ç
even while living in this body.
Performing karmas (actions or rituals) whether as a matter of duty ç
or because they have been prescribed by the scriptures, is possible ç
only as long as a person is able to see duality brought about by avidy<193> ç
or nescience. When avidy<193> is destroyed by <193>tmaj<210><193>na ç
(knowledge or direct experience of the <193>tman, the Self) and the ç
whole world including oneself is perceived as one indivisible pure ç
consciousness†sat-cit-<193>nanda†there is absolutely no scope or possibility ç
of performing any karma at all. This state of mind of the man of realisation ç
is called `nai<218>karmya' or `nai<218>karmyabh<193>va'.
However, it should not be forgotten that performing all actions ordained ç
by the scriptures with the right attitude leads to citta·uddhi or ç
purification of mind. It is only the person endowed with such purity ç
of mind that is fit for practising j<210><193>na, ultimately resulting ç
in the destruction of avidy<193> which, then, confers the state of ç
nai<218>karmya.
@NT = Nai<218>karmyasiddhi
Scholars of Advaita Ved<193>nta generally recognise four well-known ç
treatises of advaita philosophy as belonging to a special group†the ç
Siddhi group. They are:
@N-2 = 1.
@NK-1 = Brahmasiddhi of Ma<207><195>ana Mi·ra (<MS>A.D.<D>660-720)
@N-2 = 2.

@N-2 = 3.

Sarasvat<200> (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1525-1632)
@N-2 = 4.
@NK-1 = Nai<218>karmyasiddhi of Sure·var<193>c<193>rya (8th century ç
<MS>A.<|>D.<D>)
Of these, the Nai<218>karmyasiddhi of Sure·vara has earned for itself ç
an enviable place  in  Advaita  literature  not  only because Sure·vara ç
was a direct disciple of <185>a<209>kara but also because of its high ç
quality.
Though traditional biographies of <185>a<209>kara consider Sure·vara ç
as the same as Ma<207><195>ana Mi·ra after being converted by <185>a<209>kara, ç
modern scholars do not subscribe to this view.
The work is divided into four chapters, the total number of verses ç
being 423. The author himself has supplied the necessary explanations ç
and connections insimple prose wherever necessary. A brief summary ç
of the work may now be attempted here.
@S10N = First Chapter (100 Verses)
Salutation to the guru; avidy<193> or nescience, the cause of sa<221>s<193>ra ç
(bondage); karma (rituals) cannot remove avidy<193>; karma is only ç
a preliminary means; j<210><193>na (knowledge of the <193>tman/Brahman) ç
and karma can never go together; arguments of opponents demolished.
@S10N = Second Chapter (119 verses)
Ignorance of the true nature of tvam (j<200>va or the individual ç
soul) is the real obstacle to realising the identity with tat (Brahman); ç
greatness of mah<193>v<193>kyas (of Upani<218>ads); <193>tman is different ç
from the body-mind complex; scriptural authority in support of this; ç
superimposition and desuperimposition by the vision of the reality; ç
plurality is only phenomenal.
@S10N = Third Chapter (126 verses)
Nescience (avidy<193>) removable only by the mah<193>v<193>kya tat ç
tvam asi; its three aspects; what the sentence really signifies; ç
reason cannot give direct experience; however reason helps and the ç
mah<193>v<193>kya completes the work of removing avidy<193> or nescience; ç
avidy<193> is inexplicable; repetition of themah<193>v<193>kya and ç
meditation help in realisation.
@S10N = Fourth Chapter (78 verses)
Brief summary of the earlier chapters; quotations from Gau<195>ap<193>da ç
and <185>a<209>kara  in  support;  j<200>vanmukti,  the liberated ç
soul and the moral law; qualifications and dispositions needed in ç
the students of this treatise; conclusion.

Students residing in the house of theguru (gurukula) for pursuing ç
Vedic studies, were of two types: the upakurv<193><207>a and the nai<218><219>hika.
The former stayed for a limited period (like twelve years or even ç
less) and would offer gurudak<218>i<207><193> (fee or presents) before ç
leaving.
The latter stayed on till their death. They were to remain celibate, ç
serve their guru and also pursue their Vedic studies. If the teacher ç
died, they were to serve the teacher's son or the wife. They were ç
the perpetual students.
Keeping the Vedic fire of the guru burning without being put out was ç
one of their sacred duties, apart from Vedic studies and begging for ç
food. They were also to abjure all luxuries that violate their vows.

In Hindu astronomy and astrology nak<218>atra is an important subject. ç
It (the lunar mansion) is the name of 1/27th part of the path of the ç
moon round the earth (13.33 degrees of the sky). The period of sidereal ç
revolution of the moon is a little less than 27 days and 8 hours. ç
Thus the moon travels through a little less than one nak<218>atra ç
(cluster of stars) every day. The day itself can be named after the ç
nak<218>atra occupied by the moon on that day. This system of naming ç
seems to be very ancient since there are references to it even in ç
the Vedas (vide <184>gveda 10.85.13).
The Atharvaveda (14.7) and the Maitr<193>ya<207><200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> ç
(2.13.20) give the names of 28 nak<218>atras beginning with K<216>ttik<193> ç
and in this list is mentioned Abhijit also which disappears from the ç
lists of later periods.
The pur<193><207>as consider the 27 nak<218>atras as the daughters ç
of Dak<218>a and married to Candra (Moon).
The nak<218>atras are: A·vin<200>, Bhara<207><200>, K<216>ttik<193>,   Rohi<207><200>,   M<216>ga·iras,   °rdr<193>, ç

This is of two types: ekabhakta and nakta.
