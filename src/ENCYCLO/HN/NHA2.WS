In the Vanaparva of the Mah<193>-bh<193>rata (Chs. 49-77) there ç
is an interesting story of Nala, the king of Ni<218>adha country. ç
He married Damayant<200>, the daughter of the king Bh<200>ma of Vidarbha. ç
Once he came under the influence of Kalipuru<218>a, the presiding ç
(evil) spirit of the Iron Age, and lost his all in a game of dice, ç
to his own younger brother, Pu<218>kara. Then he retired to a forest ç
along with his wife. There, one night, he deserted his wife who was ç
sleeping. Damayant<200>, meanwhile, managed to return to her father, ç
the king Bh<200>ma of Vidarbha.
Nala, while traversing through the forest, tried to save the serpent ç
K<193>rko<219>aka who had been trapped in a forest fire. K<193>ko<219>aka ç
was saved and expressed his `gratitude' by biting Nala, as a result ç
of which his physical form became ugly. Assuming the name B<193>huka, ç
he went to Ayodhy<193>, where he secured an appointment as the charioteer ç
of the king <184>tupar<207>a.
When the king Bh<200>ma arranged for a second svaya<221>vara (this ç
was only a ruse to get B<193>huka to his kingdom)†a ritual wherein ç
a princess can choose her husband from among the assembled princes†for ç
Damayant<200>, <184>tupar<207>a started in his cha-riot driven by ç
B<193>huka (Nala) for Vidarbha. On the way, B<193>huka taught him ç
a·vavidy<193> (the science of tending horses) and in return learnt ç
ak<218>avidy<193> (secrets of the game of numbers and the dice).
After reaching Vidarbha <184>tupar<207>a discovered the truth, but ç
was treated as an honoured guest by the king Bh<200>ma.
@SPACE1 = 
Damayant<200> too, after a few clever tests, got her belief confirmed, ç
that B<193>huka was Nala himself. Nala regained his original from ç
by wearing the new special dress given earlier by K<193>rko<219>aka, ç
whereupon Kalipuru<218>a too left his body.
He then returned to his kingdom, challenged Pu<218>kara for another ç
round of the game of dice, won it and regained his sovereignty. He ç
pardoned Pu<218>kara and allowed him to retain his original kingdom ç
and rule over it.
In the annals of paur<193><207>ic accounts, Nala has been eulogised ç
as an ideal king and Damayant<200> as a paragon of wifely virtues.
@NT = N<193>land<193>
India has been known for ages, for its forest academies, centers of ç
learning and universities. The two universities which have carved ç
for themselves an eternal place in the bosom of Mother India as great ç
centres of learning, culture and the highest standards of morality ç
are the ones at Tak<218>a·il<193> (more commonly spelt as Taxila) ç
and N<193>land<193>. The former is the older one, the ruins being ç
situated 65 kms. (40 miles) to the east of the river Indus, near Rawalpindi ç
(now in Pakistan).
The remnants of N<193>land<193> are now in a protected area, under ç
the care of Archaeological Survey of India, adjacent to the village ç
Bargaon. It is 88 kms. (55 miles) to the south-east of Patna (capital ç
of the Bihar State) and 12 kms. (7<|>1/2 miles) from R<193>jg<200>r ç
(the ancient R<193>jag<216>ha).
All available evidence points to the fact that N<193>land<193> has ç
a very ancient history. Part of the city of R<193>jag<216>ha of those ç
days, it was the birth-place of S<193>riputra, a prominent disciple ç
of Buddha. Mah<193>v<200>ra, the last of the T<200>rtha<209>karas, ç
is said to have spent 14 rainy seasons here.
N<193>land<193> might have got its name because a huge serpent, known ç
as N<193>la, lived in a big tank nearby. Alternatively, the place ç
might have attained this nomenclature because the king who had lived ç
here was extremely generous since he never felt he had given enough ç
to the supplicant who approached him for help (na ala<221> dad<193>ti, ç
`what he gives, [he feels] is not enough').
Emperor A·oka (years of rule 272-232 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) is said to have ç
endowed the Caitya (See <MS>CAITYA.<D>) of S<193>riputra with enough ç
wealth for its maintenance and also built a temple for it.
N<193>land<193> might have attained its status as a great centre of ç
learning fromthe Gupta period (5th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) onwards.
During the time of Fahien (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 400), N<193>land<193> might ç
not have been a well- developed or important place since he does not ç
mention about it in his writings.
It is from Hiuen Tsang (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 596-664) that a detailed account ç
of N<193>land<193> can be obtained. He refers to a copper image of ç
Buddha which was 24 metres (80 ft.) in height, as seen by him at N<193>land<193>. ç
It had been established by the king P<220>r<207>avarma, a descendant ç
of A·oka. Emperor Har<218>a-vardhana (rule <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 606-647) ç
of Kany<193>-kubja (Kanauj) was a great patron of the N<193>land<193> ç
institutions.
@SPACE1 = 
N<193>land<193>  became  a  great  centre of  learning,  especially  of  Mah<193>y<193>na ç
Buddhism, though many other branchesof learning too (like tarka or ç
logic, vy<193>kara<207>a or grammar, cikits<193> or medical sciences, ç
as also the Vedas) were taught. Well-known  scholars  of  international  repute ç
like N<193>g<193>rjuna, °ryadeva, Dharmap<193>la, Di<209>n<193>ga, ç
Vasubandhu, <185><193>ntarak<218>ita, Dharmak<200>rti and Padmasambhava, ç
were closely associated with it as professors.
The buildings were well-designed and constructed to house the monks ç
and the students along with all the conveniences like living rooms, ç
tanks for bath, dining halls, lecture-halls and shrines.
Admission tests for the courses were quite tough. There were three ç
big buildings for housing the library: Ratnas<193>gara, Ratnodadhi ç
and Ratnara<210>jaka.
Students used to come not only from all over the country but also ç
from foreign countries like C<200>n<193> (China), Japan, Korea, Cambodia ç
and other South-east Asian countries as also from G<193>ndh<193>ra ç
(Afghanistan), Turkestan and Burma. According to Hiuen Tsang, there ç
were ten thousand students and several thousand monks (as teachers). ç
According to some accounts, there were 1500 teachers, and at least ç
100 lectures were delivered per day.
According to I-Tsing (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 635-713), though several Buddhist ç
nuns also lived in the campus, not even a single instance of misconduct ç
had been noticed or discovered, thanks to the high degree of moral ç
discipline kept up by the teachers and administrators.
As regards the finances, it was quite comfortable due to the munificent ç
grants from the various dynasties of the kings who were ruling the ç
country.
@SPACE1 = 
The end of its glorious period seems to have been gradually brought ç
about by: a) the inauguration and development of the Vikrama·<200>la ç
University nearby; b) The decrease of interest in academic studies ç
as a result of greater stress on living the monastic ideals; c) the ç
barbaric Muslim invasions culminating in its total destruction by ç
Bakhtiyar Khilji (circa <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1200).
It never really recovered its past glory after this.
After independence, a new institution †N<193>land<193> P<193>l<200> ç

@NT = n<193>makara<207>a
@N1 = (`the act of naming [the baby]')
N<193>makara<207>a or the ritualistic act of giving a name to a newborn ç
baby is an important sa<221>sk<193>ra or sacrament in the life of ç
a Hindu. Almost all sections of the Hindus, irrespective of their ç
caste affiliations, have some sort of ritualistic or social pattern ç
or method to be adopted in naming the baby.
During the Vedic age, the names of persons generally had two parts: ç
the actual nam<W1%17>e<D%0>and<|>a patronymic or metronomic. For instance, ç
in the name K<193>k<218><200>vanta Au·ija (Pa<210>cavi<221>·a Br<193>hma<207>a ç
14.11.17), the first is the popular name and the second derived from ç
the name of his mother U·ij<193>. And, in the name Vidagdha <185><193>kalya ç
(vide B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka Upani<218>ad 3.9.1), the former ç
is his name and the latter indicates that he was the son of <185>akala.
@SPACE1 = 
Sometimes the name could reflect the place also as in Kau·<193>mbeya ç
(resident of Kau·<193>mbi).
It is interesting to note that the B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka   Upani<218>ad   (6.4.24-28) ç
describes the n<193>makara<207>a ceremony to some extent.
Generally speaking, the n<193>makara<207>a should be performed on ç
a day after the tenth day of birth. It can be on the 11th, 12th or ç
the 16th day.
As regards the composition, the name of a boy should consist of two ç
or four or an even number of syllables while that of a girl must have ç
an odd number. Also, the name must begin with a m<216>du letter (sonant) ç
like ba, ga, da, and so on.
The names may be derived from that of a deity or a sage or an ancestor.
Though naming the girl-child after a river was prohibited in the earlier ç
period, it is now quite common.
According to the dharma·<193>stras, every child must be given a fourfold ç
name according to the nak<218>atra (asterism) under which it is born, ç
the deity of the month of birth, the family deity and a popular name, ç
the last one being commonly used for all practical purposes.
Each of the 27 nak<218>atras has four p<193>das (quarters) and certain ç
letters of the alphabet are assigned to them. The child† male or female†born ç
in that particular p<193>da must be assigned that name beginning with ç
that letter. For instance, a baby born under A·vin<200> 4th p<193>da ç
must have a name beginning with `la' (Lak<218>ma<207>a, Lat<193> etc.).
@SPACE1 = 
As regards the deities ruling over the twelve months, all of them ç
are aspects of Vi<218><207>u like K<216><218><207>a, Ananta, Hari, ç
Upendra and so on. One of these is given depending upon the month. ç
If a baby is born in the month of M<193>rga·ira (generally December) ç
its special name is K<216><218><207>a.
The third is the name associated with the family deity (kuladevat<193>), ç
the words d<193>sa, datta or bhakta being added at the end. For example, ç
if the family god is R<193>ma, the child's name will be R<193>mad<193>sa ç
or R<193>madatta or R<193>mabhakta.
@SPACE1 = 
The last is the popular name which is used throughout life. It should ç
be easy to pronounce and sweet to hear. It should also signify fame ç
or wealth or power which everyone naturally desires to possess.
It may be mentioned here, in passing, about the practice in some sections ç
of the Hindu society, of giving awkward, disgusting or even repulsive ç
names to their babies by the parents who have lost their previous ç
issues, to frighten away evil spirits, diseases and death!
Some dharma·<193>stras advocate the adding of the words ·arma or deva, ç
varma or tr<193>t<193>, bh<220>ti or datta or gupta, andd<193>sa, ç
at the end of the names given for the members of the four var<207>as ç
respectively.
A brief account of the n<193>makara<207>a ceremony as given by the ç
g<216>hyas<220>tras like those of <185><193><209>kh<193>yana (1.24.4), ç
°·val<193>yana (1.15.4) and P<193>raskara (1.17) may now be given.
After the expiry of the j<193>t<193>·aucha period (ceremonial impurity ç
caused by the birth of the baby) (generally, after ten days of birth) ç
the house has to be washed and purified. The mother and the baby should ç
be bathed. Then the mother gives the baby to the father. The father ç
touches the breaths of the baby to awaken its consciousness. Then ç
the name is given as follows. The father leaning towards the right ç
ear of the babe addresses it thus: `O child! thou art the devotee ç
of the kuladevat<193>...., so thy name is....; thou art born in such ç
and such m<193>sa or month, so thy name is....; thou art born under ç
such and such nak<218>atra (constellation), so thy name is .....; ç
and thy popular name is....'
The br<193>hma<207>as assembled there should say, `May the name be ç
established!'
Then the father should make the baby salute the assembled br<193>hma<207>as ç
who will bless it.
Afterwards, there will be a feast for all the br<193>hma<207>as and ç
the relatives and friends.
@NT = namask<193>ra
@N1 = (`obeisance')
Greeting one another, especially when one meets others for the first ç
time in the day, is a common phenomenon of courtesy in all societies.
According to the Hindu religious and cultural traditions, as enshrined ç
in the <193>gamas, the dharma·<193>stras and the pur<193><207>as, ç
this greeting can assume several forms. `Namask<193>ra' is the most ç
common and general term used for such forms of showing respect or ç
reverence.
Derived from the root-verb `nam,' which means `to bend', the word ç
`namask<193>ra' connotes bending before one's superiors in humility, ç
to show respect.
It may also mean `not mine' (na =not; ma<199> = mine), `but thine,' ç
reflecting an attitude of total surrender.
Several varieties of namask<193>ra have been mentioned in the Hindu ç
scriptural works, like abhiv<193>dana, a<210>jali and pra<207><193>ma.
In abhiv<193>dana, a person (who should be a dvija or belonging to ç
the first three castes) keeps his hands covering the ears and recites ç
his name along with other details concerning his gotra and pravara ç
or lineage, the Veda to which he belongs, the s<220>tra work, the ç
dictates of which are being followed in his family and so on. (See ç
<MS>ABHIV°DANA<D> for details.)
In a<210>jali, the two palms of the hand are joined in a mood of supplication.
Pra<207><193>ma is a special form of reverential salutation and prostration ç
before the image of a deity in a temple, one's guru (spiritual preceptor), ç
a sa<221>ny<193>sin (monk), one's parents and highly venerated persons.
This pra<207><193>ma can be `a<218><219><193><209>ga' (done with eight ç
limbs viz, the two feet, the two knees, the two arms, the chest and ç
the head touching the ground) or `pa<210>c<193><209>ga' (done with ç
five limbs, viz, the two knees, the two hands and the head touching ç
the ground).
There is another method of namask<193>ra wherein the person joins ç
the palms of his hands and places them on his own head. This is resorted ç
to when the salutation is casual and the object (or person) for whom ç
it is meant, is not regarded as very holy.
Some of the pur<193><207>as extol the pra<207><193>ma properly done ç
as equal to an A·vamedha sacrifice!
The number of pra<207><193>mas to be done in a temple may vary from ç
3 to 48.
@SPACE1 = 
Another aspect of reverence in a temple, connected with pra<207><193>ma, ç
is pradak<218>i<207>a or circumambulation. It is going round the deity ç
or the garbhag<216>ha (sanctum) keeping it always on the right. The ç
number of such circumambulations to various deities is: one for Ca<207><195><200> ç
(Divine Mother); seven for S<220>rya (Sun-god); three for Ga<207>apati; ç
four for Vi<218><207>u and three for <185>iva.
The form of circumambulation may be triangular (for Dev<200>), crescent-like ç
(for <185>ivali<209>ga) and circular for other deities.
When pra<207><193>ma is done to elders or holy persons, they may bless ç
the supplicant with such words as `svasti' (=auspiciousness), `<193>yu<218>m<193>n ç
bhava' (`May you live long!') `vardhasva' (`May you be prosperous!') ç
and so on.

This is the name of a dominant caste in the Kerala State.
The namb<220>diris are orthodox br<193>h-ma<207>as, well-versed in ç
the Vedic and the t<193>ntrik lore. They were the chief land- owners ç
before independence.
They followed a distinctive marriage alliance (called `sambandham') ç
with the n<193>yars who are k<218>attriyas and have adopted the matrilineal ç
descent system.
The  eldest  son  of  a  namb<220>diri married a namb<220>diri girl ç
whereas the younger sons had a loose type of marriage (`sambandham') ç
for the sake of progeny, with n<193>yar girls. However, neither party ç
to a sambandham union becomes a member of the other's family. Consequently ç
there is no legal responsibility or obligation on the part of the ç
`husband' towards the `wife' or the children. The children belong  to  the  `tarwad'  (joint  family) ç
descended from a common ancestress.
There are four subcastes among thenamb<220>diris, the `namb<220>dirip<193>d' ç
being considered the highest.

@SPACE1 = 
@SPACE1 = 
The path to perfection as shown by the Hindu scriptures is twofold: ç
the j<210><193>nam<193>rga (the path of knowledge) and the bhaktim<193>rga ç
(the path of devotion).
Out of these two, the latter is much easier to practise and hence ç
more popular. In this regard, the contribution of the various saints ç
of the Bhakti Movement, spread over a long period†7th to 18th century†is ç
stupendous. They not only saved the Hindu society from the impact ç
of the external forces of aggression but also helped it to achieve ç
greater internal cohesion and unity.
The saints of Maharashtra, starting with Sant J<210><193>ne·var (or ç
J<210><193>nadev) (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1275-1296), held sway for over five ç
hundred years in this field and revolutionised the life of the common ç
people.
One such saint, a musician and composer of great repute, was N<193>mdev ç
(also spelt as N<193>madeva), a contemporary of Sant J<210><193>ne·var ç
himself.
N<193>mdev was born on the K<193>rttika ·uddha ek<193>da·<200> day ç
(eleventh day of the bright half of the month of K<193>rttika, known ç
as Utth<193>na or Prabodhin<200> ek<193>da·<200>, usually in November), ç
a day considered as very sacred for the worship of the Lord Vi<218><207>u. ç
His father was D<193>m<193>·e<219>, a tailor by profession and Gonn<193><200> ç
B<193><200> was the mother.
@SPACE1 = 
Once, when N<193>mdev was a little boy, he was asked to take milk ç
from his house and offer it to Lord P<193><207><195>ura<209>ga at ç
the nearby temple. When he did so and found that the stone image was ç
not drinking the milk, he became so remorseful that he decided to ç
break his head against the stone pedestal. Moved by the child's intense ç
faith and devotion, the Lord appeared before him and actually drank ç
the milk! Though the parents would not believe his version, they were ç
wonder-struck to see it for themselves, the next day.
This experience made them give N<193>mdev full freedom to pursue the ç
devotional path, of singing and praying.
In  course  of  time  N<193>mdev  was married to R<193>ja<200>b<193><200> ç
who proved to be a devoted wife and a great help in his spiritual ç
pursuits.
N<193>mdev started living in Pa<207><195>harpur itself, spending most ç
of his time in singing the abha<209>gas (Mar<193><219>h<200> devotional ç
songs) composed by him.
Once, all the contemporary saints and devotees of Lord P<193><207><195>ura<209>ga ç
assembled in the house of Gor<193> Kumbh<193>r (Gor<193>, the potter). ç
Sant J<210><193>ne·var, their leader, jokingly asked Gor<193> to test ç
whether the `pots' that had assembled their, were `well-baked' or ç
not. When Gor<193> started the test, by gently stroking the heads ç
of the saints who had gathered, with his pot-shaping stick, N<193>mdev ç
protested against this rude method of testing, because of which, he ç
was declared as the only unripe, unbaked, pot! However, on the advice ç
of the Lord Himself, he got spiritual initiation from a qualified ç
guru†Visob<193> Khecar †thereby completing his evolution into full ç
sainthood.
While on a pilgrimage to various sacred places, he is said to have ç
performed the miracle of the water of a deep well rising to the ground ç
level and a temple of <185>iva turn in the direction of his group ç
which was singing devotional songs at the back of the temple as per ç
the orders of the priests.
@SPACE1 = 
N<193>mdev  has  composed  a  large number of abha<209>gas which are ç

Guru  N<193>nak  is  the  founder  of Sikhism,  the  youngest  of  the  great ç
religions of the world.
Whether Sikhism is an offshoot of Hinduism or a completely independent ç
religion, there is no gainsaying the fact that the Sikhs, under their ç
inspired Gurus, fought bravely with the alien hordes, many of them ç
laying down their lives too, in the process, to protect the Hindu ç
society and save Hinduism.
Guru N<193>nak was born in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1469 at Talwandi (now known ç
as N<193>nk<193>n<193> S<193>hib) which is 48 kms. (30 miles) to the ç
south-east of Lahore, now in Pakistan, as the only son of Mahit<193> ç
K<193><220> (the village accountant) and T<216>pt<193>.
N<193>nak proved to be a precocious child, exhibiting such powers ç
as speaking about various subjects of religion and philosophy at the ç
age of five, and learning all the alphabet in just one day as also ç
composing poems, at seven!
Even as he was being invested with the yaj<210>opav<200>ta (sacred ç
thread), he composed a poem that expounded the spiritual significance ç
of the same.
He was married at the tender age of 14†as was the custom during those ç
days† to Sulakkha<207><200>, daughter of M<220>lcand Co<207><193> ç
of Ba<219><193>l<193>. He had two sons from her, the first one being ç
<185>r<200>cand, the founder of the Ud<193>s<200> sect.
All efforts by his father to get him settled in the life of this world ç
failed. His brother-in-law, living at Sultanpur took him under his ç
care and got him employed as a store-keeper of the Muslim head, Daulat ç
Kh<193>n. Though he performed his allotted duties very well and won ç
the confidence of his boss, he used to distribute most of his salary ç
among the poor people.
During this period, he suddenly disappeared into a nearby forest and ç
spent three days in deep meditation. He heard a divine voice that ç
commanded him to show compassion to the suffering humanity and appointed ç
him as the Guru (or spiritual guide) for the same.
It was at Sultanpur that N<193>nak was joined by Mard<193>n<193> (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1459-1534), an old friend of his boyhood days, from his native village. ç
He was a good musician and thenceforward, became an inseparable companion ç
of the Guru, singing his compo-sitions to the accompaniment of rab<193>b ç
(rebeck), a stringed instrument similar to violin.
Soon after his return from the forest hide-out where he had had a ç
high mystical experience, he gifted away all his belongings, wore ç
the dress of a mendicant (that resembled the robe of a Hindu jogi ç
as also that of a Muslim fak<200>r) and started on a journey of the ç
country to spread his spiritual message that could bring about the ç
union of hearts of all, irrespective of their religion and beliefs.

Apart from the various important centres of Hindu pilgrimage in India, ç
N<193>nak  visited  Mecca,  Medina  and Baghdad too.
N<193>nak spread his teachings mostly through devotional and didactic ç
songs†all his own compositions†to the accompaniment of rab<193>b played ç
by Mard<193>n<193>.
Conversion of a robber Mardan Shekh to Sikhism after he repented for ç
his sins due to N<193>nak's teachings, teaching some br<193>hma<207>as ç
the futility of dry and meaning- less rituals, vanquishing quite a ç
few pundits in philosophical disputations, boldly refusing to cow ç
down before the Mughal emperor Babur's threats ordering him to become ç
a Muslim, are some of the extraordinary doings attributed to him by ç
his biographers.
After appointing A<209>gad (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1504-1552)†known earlier ç
as Len<193>†as hissuccessor, Guru N<193>nak left for his heavenly ç
abode in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1538. When the shroud covering his body was ç
removed, the body had disappeared, leaving a heap of flowers. The ç
Hindus and the Muslims shared the same and built separately a temple ç
and a mausoleum in his honour.
Guru N<193>nak's teachings are contained in the Japj<200>, comprising ç
the M<220>lmantra followed by 38 stanzas, all composed by him.
The M<220>lmantra describes God as the Only One, the Infinite One, ç
the Eternal, the Spirit, the Creator. He is All-pervading, the Sovereign ç
Lord, the Harmonious, the Immortal, the Unincarnated and the Self-existent. ç
He is worshipped by the grace of the Guru.
The Japj<200> deals with five stages through which an individual ç
soul has to pass, on its way to the realisation of God.
@SPACE1 = 
Meditation on God at dawn and the importance of God's grace are also ç
stressed greatly.
Guru N<193>nak seems to have attempted a balanced combination of the ç
best teachings of Hinduism and Islam and make his religion simple ç
as also practicable for the common masses. His eldest son <185>r<200>cand ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1494-1629) who was also a highly evolved spiritual ç
soul, started his own monastic sect (the Ud<193>s<200> sect).

@NT = Nanda
Nanda was the chieftain of the cowherds at the village Gokula. He ç
was an intimate friend of Vasudeva, the father of <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a ç
and Balar<193>ma.
He and his wife Ya·od<193> were, in a previous life, Vasus (a race ç
of semi-gods) known as Dro<207>a and Dhar<193>. They had performed ç
severe austerities to get God as their son. A voice from the void ç
had assured them that God would bless them in a future life with his ç
childish pranks (as their foster-son) bringing great joy.
<185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a and Balar<193>ma spent their childhood ç
days with Nanda and Ya·od<193> until they left for Mathur<193> for ç
good. During this period, <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a saved Nanda ç
from drowning in the river Yamun<193>.
Many years later, Nanda, when he learnt that <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a ç
and Balar<193>ma had come to Syamantapa<210>caka (same as Kuru-k<218>etra) ç
to take a dip in the holy lake there on a solar eclipse day, hurried ç
to the place with plenty of food and other useful things. <185>r<200> ç
K<216><218><207>a is said to have honoured Nanda and Ya·od<193> in ç
many ways and also taught spiritual wisdom to the gop<200>s who too ç
had come to meet him.

@NT = Nandaka
@N1 = (`that which gives joy [to the gods]')
All the deities of the Hindu pantheon have their <193>yudhas or weapons ç
and other objects, normally held in their hands.
Though Mah<193>vi<218><207>u (or Vi<218><207>u) is usually shown with ç
·a<209>kha (conch), cakra (discus), gad<193> (mace) and padma (lotus) ç
in his four hands, he has four more accessories. They are: Nandaka ç
(a sword), <185><193>r<209>ga (a bow), musala (mace) and Vanam<193>l<193> ç
(garland of wild flowers).
All  these  eight  are  worshipped keeping them in the eight directions.
The Agnipur<193><207>a (Ch. 245) contains an interesting story with ç
regard to the sword Nandaka.
Once the four-faced Brahm<193>, the creator, was performing a sacrifice ç
on the bank of the river Ga<209>g<193>. When he was sitting in deep ç
meditation, a demon, Loh<193>sura by name, came there with the intention ç
of disturbing the sacrifice. At once, a male deity emerged out of ç
Brahm<193>'s body who was greeted by the gods assembled there, with ç
cheers. He suddenly got transformed into an excellent sword and Mah<193>vi<218><207>u ç
accepted it as a gift from the gods. He then cut Loh<193>sura into ç
pieces each of which became a metal.
Mah<193>vi<218><207>u then blessed the sword Nandaka (the presiding ç
deity of the sword) with a pure body as also various boons.
@NT = Nandana
@N1 = (`that which gives joy')
Nandana  or  Nandanavana  is  a pleasure garden in Indra's svargaloka ç
or heaven. Only those who have controlled their senses and practised ç
ahi<221>s<193> (non- violence) are eligible to enter it.
It is also the name of one of the sons of Hira<207>yaka·ipu, the demon-king ç
and father of Prahl<193>da, the famous devotee of Lord Vi<218><207>u. ç
He was a devotee of <185>iva and ruled over the <185>vetadv<200>pa. ç
(See <MS><185>VETA-DV®PA<D>.) Later on, he was absorbed into <185>iva's ç
retinue.
@NT = Nandan<193>r
If orthodoxy and social hierarchy divided the Hindu society, often ç
causing great discontent among the lower classes and alienating them ç
from the aristocrats, the Bhakti Movement started by the great mystics ç
and saints of India united all† irrespective of caste and class†into ç
one family of devotees of God.
One such great saint hailing from the Tamil country was Nandan<193>r. ç
He belonged to the untouchable group of castes. Being an ardent devotee ç
of Lord <185>iva, he often longed to go to the holy city of Cidambaram ç
(or Chidambaram) and have a dar·an (seeing the image) of the Lord ç
there. After months of hesitation he reached the place. But, recalling ç
the greatness of the city and his own low-birth status, he considered ç
himself unworthy to enter it. Though he remained outside its walls, ç
his yearning for the Lord became so intense that the br<193>hma<207>a ç
priests were commanded by the Lord <185>iva himself to bring his devotee ç
into the temple. When this was done, Nandan<193>r is said to have ç
fallen into an ecstatic state.
Very little is known of his life and times.
@NT = Nandapa<207><195>ita
Nandapa<207><195>ita (circa <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1580-1630), son of R<193>mapa<207><195>ita ç
Deva·arma, was a descendant of Lak<218>m<200>dhara, belonging to Bidar ç
(now in North Karnataka). He probably lived mostly in K<193>·<200> ç
where he composed his voluminous works on the dharma·<193>stras. His ç
another name was Vin<193>yaka.
He was patronised by several rich persons from different parts of ç
India, like Param<193>nanda of the Sahagila family, Hariva<221>·avarma ç
of the Mahendra family and Ke·avan<193>yaka of Madhur<193>.
His<|>most famous work is the Dattaka-m<200>m<193><221>s<193> which ç
had been considered as an authority even by the British rulers of ç
India while settling family disputes of the Hindus.
Out of the thirteen works attributed to him, a few many be mentioned ç
here:
Vidvanmanohar<193> on Par<193>·arasm<216>ti; Pramit<193>k<218>ar<193>, ç
a commentary on the Mit<193>-k<218>ar<193> of Vij<210><193>ne·vara ç
(12th century <MS>A.D.<D>); <185>r<193>ddhakalpalat<193>; Sm<216>tisindhu ç
and its summary Tattvamukt<193>val<200>.
The Dattakam<200>m<193><221>s<193> has his own commentary.
Though Nandapa<207><195>ita generally follows the Mit<193>k<218>ar<193>, ç
he sometimes differs strongly from it with regard to succession and ç
a few other matters.
@NT = Nandi
Anyone visiting a temple of Lord <185>iva will not miss the image ç
of a reclining bull, generally facing the <185>ivali<209>ga in the ç
sanctum. This bull is called by various names such as Nandi, Nand<200>·vara ç
or Nandike·vara. It is the v<193>hana or mount of Lord <185>iva even ç
as the Garu<195>a (eagle) is the v<193>hana of Lord Vi<218><207>u.
There are several stories in the pur<193><207>as about this Nandike·vara.
A sage, <185><193>la<209>k<193>yana by name, performed austerities ç
to get a worthy son. Pleased with him, Vi<218><207>u appeared before ç
him; and lo! a baby figure exactly like <185>iva emerged out of him. ç
This was Nandike·vara.
According to another legend, the sage <185>il<193>da performed a yaj<210>a ç
to get a son who would be immortal. A brilliant lad, resembling <185>iva, ç
suddenly appeared from the inner apartment of his house. He was Nandike·vara. ç
Another story states that sage who performed severe austerities on ç
the Mu<210>jav<193>n peak of Mandara mountain was made the chief of ç
his attendants by <185>iva, who gave him the name Nand<200>·vara or ç
Nandike·vara. Iconographically, Nandi-ke·vara<|>is shown either as ç
a small reclining bull facing the <185>ivali<209>ga in the sanc- tum ç
or as a big bull in a separate ma<207><195>apa (hall) with elaborate ç
workmanship, either facing the main shrine or the main gate.
In many temples, especially in Tamil Nadu, Nandike·vara is shown in ç
the human form, either with a bull's head or a human head with ja<219><193>muku<219>a. ç
(See <MS>JA<187>°MUKU<187>A<D>.) He may have three eyes and four arms, ç
the back hands holding para·u (axe) and m<216>ga (deer) and the front ç
two folded in supplication (a<210>jalimudr<193>).
Nandike·vara is said to have cursed R<193>va<207>a to be destroyed ç
by monkeys when he once ridiculed him near the Kail<193>sa mountain ç
(R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, Uttarak<193><207><195>a 16).
The image of Nandike·vara should be stationed at the dak<218>i<207>adv<193>ra ç
or southern door of the temple.
