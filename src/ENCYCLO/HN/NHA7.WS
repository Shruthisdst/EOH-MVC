The Ka<219>ha Upani<218>ad (2.2) declares that every human being ç
has the opportunity to choose between the preyas and the ·reyas.
Preyas is what is pleasant, the apparently good, but which ultimately ç
turns out to be bad, painful and ruinous.
<185>reyas is that which is really good, though at first sight, it ç
may not appear to be attractive.
A wise person always chooses the latter in preference to the former.
<185>reyas, again, has two stages: the abhyudaya and the ni··reyas. ç
The former is worldly well-being got through dharma or the righteous ç
means. This, however, is not permanent.
Ni··reyas, on the other hand, is spiritual well-being, leading to ç
mok<218>a or liberation, the highest good. The word is used to indicate ç
mok<218>a also.

The word `nitya' is generally used in the Hindu scriptures, in two ç
senses: what is eternal; daily.
That which is beyond time, space and causation, and hence unaffected ç
by them is called `nitya'. Only the <193>tman (the Self or the soul) ç
and Brahman (the Absolute or God) fit in with this definition.
In some of the dar·anas (philosophies), some other objects like param<193><207>us ç
(atoms) or k<193>la (time) or pradh<193>na or prak<216>ti (Nature, ç
matrix of all insentient objects comprising the three gu<207>as, sattva, ç
rajas and tamas) are also considered as nitya or eternal.
As applied to karmas or prescribed rites, nitya (or nityakarma) refers ç
to the obligatory duties to be performed daily, such as the sandhy<193>, ç
g<193>yatr<200>japa and pa<210>ca-mah<193>yaj<210>as. They gradually ç
lead to citta-·uddhi or purity of mind.

Vallabh<193>c<193>rya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1473-1531) was an important teacher ç
of the schools ofVed<193>nta that teach, nay, lay great emphasis ç
on bhakti or devotion to God, as the sole means of God-realisation ç
and liberation.
He classifies the souls into three types: prav<193>ha (those who are ç
ever busy with worldly life); mary<193>d<193> (those who follow the ç
Vedic path strictly); and pu<218><219>i (those who worship the Lord ç
out of pure love engendered only through divine grace).
God, out of his own free will, brings out a pu<218><219>i-type of ç
soul out of himself, gives him a divine body like his own and sports ç
with him (the pu<218><219>i-soul) for all time! This divine play ç
is called `nityal<200>l<193>' wherein God remains subservient to that ç
soul, giving him the joy of his own company. This joy has been technically ç
called, `bhajan<193>nanda'.

The Ved<193>nta philosophy has branched off into three main schools: ç
advaita, vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita and dvaita.
In the Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita Ved<193>nta, the j<200>vas (individual ç
souls) are divided into three varieties of whom nityas<220>ris or ç
nityamuktas (like °di·e<218>a, Garu<195>a and Vi<218>vaksena) are ç
the first. They were never in bondage, but ever happy in the company ç
of Lord Vi<218><207>u.
In the Dvaita Ved<193>nta, the word is applied only to Brahman or ç
God and Lak<218>m<200>, his consort.

@N1 = (`a permanent reiterating statement')
The P<220>rvam<200>m<193><221>s<193> system of Hindu philosophy deals ç
with the various modes of interpreting and understanding the Vedic ç
statements. One of them is arthav<193>da. (See <MS>ARTHAV°DA<D> for ç
details.)
One of the three aspects of arthav<193>da is anuv<193>da. When a statement ç
reiterates something which has already been known otherwise it is ç
called `anuv<193>da' (anu = following; v<193>da = stating or statement). ç
For instance, the statement `agnir himasya bhe<218>ajam,' `Fire is ç
the antidote for cold' (Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> 7.4.18.2) ç
contains a truth already known through direct experience.
A subsidiary aspect of anuv<193>da is nity<193>nuv<193>da. When a ç
Vedic text apparently prohibits something which can never happen, ç
it is called `nity<193>nuv<193>da'. For example: `The Vedic altar ç
should not be piled on bare earth, nor in the sky, nor in heaven.' ç
In this sentence, the piling of the Vedic altar in the way described ç
is never done. The latter two options can never happen! Hence it is ç
called `nity<193>nuv<193>da'.
This word occurs in the °pastamba Dharmas<220>tras (2.6.14.3) and ç
in the P<220>rva-m<200>m<193><221>s<193>s<220>tras of Jaimini (2.4.26; ç
9.4.36).

The Dvaita Ved<193>nta of Madhva (<MS>A.D.<D>1238-1317) categorises ç
the j<200>vas or individual  souls  into  three  groups: muktiyogyas ç
(those who are fit for liberation); nitya-sa<221>s<193>rins (the eternally ç
transmigrating ones); and the tamoyogyas (the damned ones).
The nityasa<221><193>ris are sensuous beings who delight only in worldly ç
values and feel no need for ethical or spiritual life. Hence they ç
are forced to transmigrate eternally (nitya = eternally).

`Great things can be done by great sacrifices only!' averred Vivek<193>nanda ç
(<MS>A.D.<D> 1863-1902). Nivedit<193>†the Dedicated One †his illustrious ç
disciple, did exactly that. She sacrificed her people, her country ç
and her culture, to devote every breath of her life for the cause ç
she loved†at the command of her guru, her mentor†serving India and ç
its people. She showed Indians how to be truly Indian. She made the ç
Hindus feel a few inches taller, by heroverflowing love and admiration ç
for Hinduism which she vigorously propagated, a la Vivek<193>nanda!
Margaret Elizabeth Noble†that was her original name†was born at Dungannon ç
(Ireland) on October 28, 1867. Rev.Samuel Richmond Noble and Mary ç
Isabel were her parents.
After being ordained as a Protestant preacher, Samuel started living ç
at Great Torrington in Devonshire (England) along with his family. ç
However, when death snatched him away at the young age of thirtyfour, ç
Mary Noble shifted back to her father's place in Ireland where Margaret ç
continued her education.
She completed her education at the age of seventeen and became a teacher ç
in a school at Keswick (England). Later she shifted to Wimbledon and ç
started her own school using the newly discovered Froebel- method. ç
She spent ten years as a teacher, from <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1884-1894.
Though she was deeply religious by nature and loved Jesus with all ç
her heart, the Christian doctrines of the Church did not satisfy her ç
spiritual hunger. Though the life and teachings of the Buddha, which ç
she happened to read at that time, brought some solace to her troubled ç
soul, the inner turbulence continued, leaving many a question unanswered.
It was at this critical juncture of her life that she learnt of the ç
arrival of a `Hindu Yogi' whose discourses and personality had started ç
casting a spell as it were, on the Londonites.
Vivek<193>nanda visited England twice, the second visit being a much ç
longer one. By listening to his talks and getting her doubts cleared ç
through searching questions, for which she got scintillating answers, ç
Margaret was now fully convinced of Vivek<193>nanda's greatness and ç
accepted him as her spiritual Master.
One day, when he was talking of his plan of work which included the ç
upliftment of Indian women through proper education and training, ç
and hinted that she could be of great help in the same, she felt an ç
inner urge to accept the call.
@SPACE1 = 
It needed her quite some time to make up her mind. Vivek<193>nanda ç
wrote her a long letter explaining the various problems and difficulties ç
she would have to face in India if she decided to take the plunge. ç
However, the great assurance that the Sv<193>mi gave to her, that ç
he will stand by her unto death, irrespective of her decision, settled ç
the issue.
Margaret arrived at Calcutta on the 28th January 1898 and was received ç
by Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda himself. She was first accommodated in ç
a hotel for a few days and later shifted to a cottage in Belur, at ç
the site newly bought by her guru for establishing the future monastery ç
of the Ramakrishna Order. Mrs. Sara Bull and Miss Josephine Macleod, ç
two well-known American disciples of the Sv<193>mi, joined her at ç
this time.
The teacher, to assist in whose mission she had come, started training ç
her in right earnest by narrating to her (and the other ladies) tales ç
and history of the Indian people, about their courage, heroism and ç
faith, as also the purity and sacrifices of its noble women.
He introduced her to the people of Calcutta in a big public meeting, ç
where she too spoke about the influence of Indian spiritual thought ç
on England.
The most memorable day in her life was her meeting <185>r<200> S<193>rad<193> ç
Dev<200> (the divine consort of <185>r<200> R<193>mak<216><218><207>a) ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1853-1920) better known as the Holy Mother, on the ç
17th March, for the first time. The Mother greeted her very affectionately  which  made  a  tremendous ç
impression on her mind.
@SPACE1 = 
Margaret had started very earnestly to cast off her arrogance and ç
superiority complex and Indianise herself by hard tapas or austerity, ç
like an orthodox Indian lady.
When Vivek<193>nanda was convinced that she was ripe and ready for ç
the great work he had in mind, he performed a simple religious ceremony, ç
administered some lifelong vows and dedicated her to the service of ç
God. He gave her a new name, `Nivedit<193>' (one who is offered to ç
or dedicated to God).
Travelling with her guru through thevarious places of pilgrimage ç
and of historical interest, she learnt a lot, not only about India ç
and her people, but also about her guru himself, the various facets ç
of his fascinating personality.
After returning, she lived for some time in the house of the Holy ç
Mother, getting a first-hand knowledge and taste of an orthodox Hindu ç
household.
As per the directions of her teacher, she started in her newly acquired ç
house in the same area, a school for girls. It was inaugurated by ç
no less a person than the Holy Mother herself on the auspicious K<193>l<200>p<220>j<193> ç
day (13th November 1898), Vivek<193>nanda and other members of the ç
Ramakrishna Order also being present.
Though ignorance and wrong understanding prevented the orthodox and ç
high-caste Hindus to send their girls to Nivedit<193>'s school at ç
first, her earnestness and entreaties quickly won them over. The school ç
soon became full of pupils, bubbling with various activities. Nivedit<193> ç
taught them the three R's, painting, sewing and clay-modelling and ç
told inspiring stories.
A severe epidemic of plague broke out in Calcutta in March 1899. As ç
per the directions of Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda, Nivedit<193>, with ç
the help of some Sv<193>mis and volunteers, organised relief work ç
excellently, thereby earning the gratitude of the people of the city. ç
This was the maiden relief work of the Ramakrishna Mission.
@SPACE1 = 
To raise funds for her school which was growing at a fast pace, she ç
travelled widely, both in England and in America. She returned to ç
India in February 1902. She then reopened the school on the sacredVasanta ç
Pa<210>cam<200> day, considered as specially auspicious for the worship ç
of Sarasvat<200>, the goddess of learning.
As the school flourished, a section for educating the women also was ç
added.
(Since 1963, The school, now known as ``Sister Nivedita Girls' School,'' ç
is under the management of the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.)
Inscrutable are the ways of theunseen hand. Nivedit<193> had met ç
the Sv<193>mion the 2n<%26>d<%0>Jul<%12>y<%0>1902. On the 4th he ç
wasgone!
Though this was a terrible blow to her, it also steeled her to rededicate ç
herself for the work he had entrusted to her. Hereafter, India became ç
her object of love, adoration and commitment.
Having grown up in her younger days in an atmosphere of Irish rebellion ç
for freedom from the shackles of England, Nivedit<193> could easily ç
understand and appreciate the struggle for political freedom launched ç
by the Indian people. She now plunged into this movement†after resigning ç
from the Ramakrishna Order which could not associate itself with any ç
political movement†and became a source of inspiration, not only to ç
the youth but also to the great leaders of the movement itself. Her ç
whirlwind tour of the country as also fiery speeches and an uncompromising ç
attitude helped to rouse many an Indian from sloth and slumber.
@SPACE1 = 
She introduced the singing of the famous `Vande M<193>taram'†which ç
was an anathema to the British rulers†in herschool. She encouraged ç
the Indian artists to revive the ancient art of their motherland. ç
She inspired Indian scientists like Jagadish Chandra Bose (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1858-1937) in their research work. She vigorously propagated the need ç
for good education on national lines, the upliftment of women and ç
unity among all the peoples of the country irrespective of race, religion ç
or local culture.
Nivedit<193> was fortunate in getting the love, affection and blessings ç
of the Holy Mother S<193>rad<193> Dev<200> in an abundantmeasure. ç
She cherished this till her last breath.
Continuous travelling and hard work told upon her frail health. She ç
fell seriously ill, once in 1905 and again in 1911. She passed away ç
peacefully on the 13th October 1911, at Darjeeling.
The place where her mortal remains were cremated, has a memorial with ç
this inscription: <MS>HERE REPOSE THE ASHES OF SISTER NIVEDITA (MARGARET ç
E. NOBLE) OF THE RAMAKRISHNA VIVEKANANDA, WHO GAVE HER ALL TO INDIA<D>. ç
<MS>13, OCTOBER 1911.<D>
Nivedit<193> was a prolific writer. There are fifteen books penned ç
by her which have been brought out as a set of volumes under the general ç
title The Complete Works of Sister Nivedita Vol. I to IV, (Publication: ç
Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Sister Nivedita Girls' School, Calcutta ç
1967-1968) during her centenary year (1967). Out of them, the two ç
books†The Master as I saw Him and Notes on Some Wanderings with ç
the Swami Vivekananda †give us a fascinating picture of the great ç
Sv<193>mi.
If India is free today, the credit for inspiring her national leaders ç
of thefreedom movement, goes as much to Nivedit<193> as to her guru, ç
Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda.

Prav<216>tti and niv<216>tti are two words often met with in the works ç

The path of the g<216>hastha or the householder is prav<216>ttim<193>rga ç
and that of the sa<221>ny<193>sin, the monk, is the niv<216>tti-m<193>rga.
A householder is actively engaged in several works advocated by the ç
scriptures, to fulfil his duties at the personal, the family and the ç
social level. The entire social structure depends upon this activism ç
on his part.
On the other hand, a sa<221>ny<193>sin is expected to spend most of ç
his time in the contemplation on the <193>tman/Brahman and teach others ç
the path to perfection, out of the fulness of his own experience. ç
For this he has to give up all other activities which he might have ç
been doing in an earlier stage. This giving up is niv<216>tti and ç

In the most general sense, the word `niyama' means a rule or discipline. ç
This includes things that are ordained or prohibited, especially during ç
the observance of vratas or religious vows.
In the Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali (200<MS>B.C.<D>) it forms ç
the second of the eight steps of yoga and comprises these five disciplines: ç
·auca (cleanliness), santo<218>a (contentment), sv<193>dhy<193>ya ç
(study of scriptures), tapas (austerity) and <200>·varapra<207>i-dh<193>na ç
(devotion to God and dedication of the fruits of work (vide 2.32).
The Ha<219>hayogaprad<200>pik<193> (1.17) gives a longer list of ç
disciplines under niyama. They are: tapas (austerity), santo<218>a ç

charity), <200>·varap<220>jana (worship of God), siddh<193>nta-v<193>kya·rava<207>a ç
(listening to the statements of the scriptures), hr<200> (modesty), ç
mati (discerning mind), japa (repetition of mantras) and huta (sacrifice, ç

widow marrying the brother of her husband to raise issues.
`Niyoga' literally means `appointing'. In a more technical sense it ç
means the appointment of a childless wife or a widow to procreate ç
a son from intercourse with an appointed male.
Frequent wars among the k<218>attriya princes and kings, leading to ç
large scale deaths, leaving behind young childless widows, could have ç
been one of the major causes for this practice. Another cause could ç
have been getting a right over the husband's property since a childless ç
widow had been debarred from it except bare maintenance.
The Mah<193>bh<193>rata is full of instances of niyoga, the most ç
well-known one being the command of Satyavat<200> (the mother of Vy<193>sa ç
from the sage Par<193>·ara) to Vy<193>sa to procreate sons in the ç
two widows of her son Vicitrav<200>rya who died prematurely.
Most of the dharma·<193>stras have condemned the practice†which must ç
have existed in very ancient times†though some have permitted it under ç
stringent conditions.
Eight necessary conditions were laid down, almost all of which were ç
rigorous. The most important of them were that the decision had to ç
be taken by the elders of the family and the person had to be the ç
brother of the husband or belonging to his gotra and/or pravara. The ç
relation would last only till a son is born.
Gradually the practice was frowned upon by one and all, and was included ç
under the list of kalivarjya items (things to be avoided in the age ç
of Kali).
@NT = N<216>ga
The Hindu scriptures prescribe various rules even for giving gifts. ç
If a gift given to one is given again to another, even if it be by ç
mistake, the giver has to suffer the consequences for this sin or ç
undergo some punishment.
N<216>ga was a famous king of the solar race. He donated a cow once ç
to a br<193>hma<207>a. The cow somehow escaped from his house, returned ç
to the palace and joined the herd. Not being aware of this, the king ç
gifted it to another br<193>hma<207>a. When the first receiver of ç
the gift started searching for his missing cow, he found it in the ç
house of the second br<193>hma<207>a. As a dispute arose over its ç
ownership, both of them went to the king seeking justice.
The inordinate delay of the king in meeting them to settle the dispute ç
made them curse the king to become a chameleon. He was later rescued ç
from that miserable condition by Lord <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a ç
(vide Bh<193>gavata 10.64).
@NT = N<216>si<221>ha-t<193>pin<200> Upani<218>ad
Among the minor Upani<218>ads those of the T<193>pin<200> group have ç
an important place. They mostly deal with the details connected with ç
the up<193>san<193>s (meditations) of the particular deity whose name ç
they bear.
The N<216>si<221>ha-t<193>pin<200> Upani<218>ad†like the other similar ç
Upani<218>ads†is also in two parts: the P<220>rva and the Uttara. ç
Theformer has a bh<193><218>ya (commentary) ascribed to <185>a<209>kara ç
(<MS>A. D.<D> 788-820) whereas the latter has one called D<200>pik<193> ç
by the sage Vidy<193>ra<207>ya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1296-1386). Upani<218>ad ç
Brahmayogin has also commented on them.
The P<220>rva has been divided into five sections, each being called ç
an `Upani<218>ad,' and having a total of 77 mantras. They are mostly ç
in prose, interspersed occasionally with <184>gvedic mantras.
It is assigned to the Atharvaveda and begins with the well-known ç
·<193>ntimantra (peace-chant), `bhadra<221> kar<207>ebhi<199>'.
Before creation there were only vast causal waters. Praj<193>pati, ç
the creator, was manifested out of the navel-lotus of the Supreme ç
Lord N<193>r<193>ya<207>a. He desired to create this world and did ç
tapas (austerity). He then saw†or realised or obtained†the famous ç
N<193>rasi<221>hamantra, the king or the crown-jewel of all mantras, ç
in the anu<218><219>ubh metre. He then created the whole world out ç
of the power of that mantra.
@SPACE1 = 
@BT9 = [<|>Neither the Upani<218>ad nor the commentators give the actual ç
N<193>rasi<221>ha-mantra in the anu<218><219>ubh metre which is ç
sung as a s<193>ma. The actual mantra as found in some mantra-·<193>stra ç
works is:
@P1 = ugra<221> v<200>ram mah<193>vi<218><207>u<221><R>ç
jvalanta<221> sarvatomukham<F49P12M>e<F255P255D><R>ç

@TR = (Prapa<210>cas<193>ras<193>rasa<209>graha 23)
@BT9 = It means: `I bow down to N<216>si<221>ha (the Man-lion incarnation ç
of Vi<218><207>u) who is terrible, valorous, blazing (like the fire ç
or the sun), all-pervading, awful, death of even the god of death, ç
and yet, the ever-auspicious Mah<193>vi<218><207>u!'
@SPACE1 = 
@BT9 = Though there are other mantras of N<216>si<221>ha in other ç
metres like the g<193>yatr<200>, it is this mantra in the anu<218><219>ubh ç
metre that is meant in this Upani<218>ad. In this metre there are ç
four p<193>das or quarters and 32 ak<218>aras or syllables. This factor ç
should be kept in mind while studying the concepts given later, in ç
this work.]
@EMERGENCY = The  Upani<218>ad  then  compares  or considers the entire ç
earth, the demigods in theantarik<218>a (sky or upper regions), the ç
dyuloka (heavenly regions including the gods like Vasus, Rudras and ç
°dityas) and Brahman, the pure, as the four p<193>das or quarters ç
of the Anu<218><219>ubh (the N<193>rasi<221>ha-mantra).
@EMERGENCY = This analogy is then extended to the four Vedas also.
@EMERGENCY = Then comes a eulogy of the greatness of  the  repetition  of  this  mantra  by ç
describing the wonderful results one gets.
The identification of various beings and things in this universe†like ç
fire, gods, vital-airs, sun, moon, the trinity and so on†with the ç
four p<193>das of the mantra is further continued.
@EMERGENCY = The japa (repetition) of this mantra, it is then stated, ç
will result in the vision of that deity.
Thus ends the first section.
@EMERGENCY = The second section describes how the gods in heaven, ç
being afraid of transmigratory existence, approached Praj<193>pati ç
who taught them this mantra. By that, they conquered sin and death.
The description of meditation on the four parts of Pra<207>ava (a, ç
u, m and half-syllable at the end) as identified with the four Vedas ç
and some other objects like the g<193>rhapatya fire or gods like Vi<218><207>u ç
and Rudra comes next.
How to use the mantra for ny<193>sas (See <MS>NY°SA<D> for details.) ç
along with the syllable Om is described thereafter.
Then follows a detailed exposition of each of the words contained ç
in the mantra, like ugra, v<200>ra, Vi<218><207>u and so on.
Since man (n<216>) is the best of higher living beings and the lion ç
(si<221>ha) the best of the lower kind, he assumed the form of N<216>si<221>ha, ç
to show that he is the very best of creation in all its aspects.
The third section begins with the question of the devas or gods (in ç
heaven) to Praj<193>pati regarding the ·akti (power) and the b<200>ja ç
(seed) of the N<193>rasi<221>ha- mantra. Praj<193>pati replies that ç
m<193>y<193>-power of the Lord is the ·akti and <193>k<193>·a (sky ç
or ether) is the b<200>ja. It is because of the m<193>y<193>-power ç
that Praj<193>pati can create and it is from <193>k<193>·a (the first ç
product) that everything else proceeds.
The fourth section deals with the a<209>gamantras (mantras subsidiary ç
to the main one) which are: Om; the S<193>vitr<200> of Yajurveda ç
(same as the first part of M<193>h<193>- n<193>r<193>ya<207>a Upani<218>ad ç
15.2); the Lak<218>m<200>- mantra of Yajurveda (O<221> bh<220>rlak<218>m<200> ç
and so on).
Then the famous N<216>si<221>hag<193>yatr<200> mantra is narrated. ç
It is:
@SPACE1 = 
@P1 = o<221> n<216>si<221>h<193>ya vidmahe<R>ç
vajranakh<193>ya dh<200>mahi<R>ç
tanna<199> si<221>ha<199> pracoday<193>t<F49P12M>f
@SPACE1 = 
The fifth section describes the famous Sudar·anacakra (discus) of ç
Lord Narasi<221>ha (an aspect of Mah<193>vi<218><207>u). It may have ç
six spokes or eight or twelveor sixteen or even thirty two with corresponding ç
teeth. The esoteric meditations connected with them are also described.
This is then followed by a fairly long phala·ruti, the statement of ç
the results one gets by repeating the N<193>rasi<221>ha- mantra. ç
As a sample a few such results may be stated:
One who repeats this mantra becomes purified, as if by the five elements. ç
He crosses over all sins and conquers even death. He can prevent the ç
five elements from exercising their power by over- powering them. ç
He can attract to himself other beings like the demigods (yak<218>as, ç
n<193>gas and the grahas or planetary deities) as also the gods. He ç
ultimately attains the highest abode of Lord Vi<218><207>u.
The Uttarat<193>pin<200> of the same Upani<218>ad has nine kha<207><195>as ç
or sections and 84 mantras, all in prose, except for occasional quotations ç
from the Vedas.
This work, almost entirely, teaches Advaita Ved<193>nta. The topics ç
can be summarised very briefly as follows:
Identity of <193>tman and Brahman; the four states of consciousness, ç
the fourth being the <193>tman; meditation on the <193>tman with the ç
help of O<221> or Pra<207>ava; gods conquering the demons with the ç
help of the N<216>si<221>hamantra; creation of the world by Brahman ç
with the m<193>y<193>-power and entering into it; the gods deciding ç
to acquire the knowledge (or experience) of the Advay<193>tman, the ç
one °tman without a second; Praj<193>pati teaching it to them.
Thus ends this Upani<218>ad.
@NT = n<216>ttam<220>rti
@N1 = (`icon in the dancing posture')
Some deities of the Hindu pantheon are sometimes shown in the posture ç
of dancing (n<216>tta = dancing). They are hencecalled `n<216>ttam<220>rtis'. ç
The deities thus represented are: <185>iva, Ga<207>apati, K<216><218><207>a ç
and apsaras (celestial nymphs).
Occasionally we come across some stories in the pur<193><207>as describing ç
the reasons for such dancing. <185>iva danced the t<193>n<195>ava ç
dance to please the gods who had assembled in Kail<193>sa and had ç
requested him to exhibit it to them.
Ga<207>apati was immensely pleased and started dancing when the fourfaced ç
Brahm<193>, the creator, bowed down low before him in great reverence!
K<216><218><207>a's dancing is connected with his subjugating the ç
terrible serpent K<193>liya who was residing in the river Yamun<193>, ç
making its water highly poisonous.
@EMERGENCY = For the apsaras like Rambh<193> and <188>rva·<200>, dancing ç
is a part of their professional discipline.
@NT = ny<193>sa
@N1 = (`to deposit')

@NT = ny<193>ya
@N1 = (`that which takes by the right path')
@EMERGENCY = This word is used in several senses, the most general ç
one being `what is right or proper'. It also stands for the Ny<193>ya ç
philosophy.  (See  <MS>NY°YA  DAR<185>ANA<D>  for details.) In particular, ç
it indicates the general line of an argument which musthave five ç
steps: pratij<210><193> (the first enunciation of what is to be proved); ç
hetu (the reason); ud<193>hara<207>a (illustrations); upanaya (corroboration); ç
and, nigamana (final conclusion).
@NT = Ny<193>ya Dar·ana
@S10 = Introduction
@EMERGENCY = Of the six systems of Indian philosophy grouped under ç
the category of °stika Dar·anas (systems that accept the authority ç
of the Vedas), the Ny<193>ya Dar·ana of Gotama or Gautama (550 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>)†also ç
known as Ak<218>ap<193>da†comes first. Though it is sometimes coupled ç
with the Vai·e<218>ika Dar·ana of Ul<220>ka or Ka<207><193>da (600 ç
<MS>B. C.<D>) and considered as a unified, or even a single, system, ç
it has its own unique features. Hence it deserves to be treated as ç
a separate and independent school of philosophy.
@EMERGENCY = Almost all the branches of Indian philosophy deal with ç
two subjects: The pram<193><207>as or valid sources of knowledge, ç
and, the prameyas or things to be known through them.
Since  the  Ny<193>ya  Dar·ana  gives primary importance to the first ç
subject and has developed it in great detail, it has laid a firm foundation ç
for the science of Indian logic. Hence it has been called Ny<193>yavidy<193>, ç
Tarka·<193>stra and °nv<200>k<218>ak<200> also.
@S10 = Literature
The  Ny<193>yas<220>tras  of  Gautama  is considered as the basic ç
text of this system. It is in five chapters, each of which is again ç
divided into two sections. The total number of s<220>tras is 523. ç
It has a bh<193><218>ya or commentary by V<193>tsy<193>yana (<MS>A.D.<D> ç
400). This Ny<193>yabh<193><218>ya has a Ny<193>ya-v<193>rttika ç
(a sub-commentary) by one Udyotakara (7th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>). ç
V<193>caspati (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 841) has further elucidated this work ç
in his T<193>tparya<219><200>k<193>. The last in this series of ç
commentaries is the T<193>tparya<219><200>k<193>-pari-·uddhi by ç
Udayana (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 984). His another work is Kusum<193><210>jal<200>. ç
Mention may also be made of the Ny<193>yama<210>jar<200> of Jayanta ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 880) and the Tattvacint<193>ma<207>i of Ga<209>ge·a ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1200). This last work laid the foundation for a new ç
or modern(and highly advanced) school of Ny<193>ya philosophy, now ç
well-known as `Navya-ny<193>ya'. It flourished in Bengal with Navadv<200>pa ç
as its nerve-centre.
Other important works that need to be mentioned are: The Tarkasa<209>graha ç
of A<207><207>ambha<219><219>a (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1650) and the K<193>rik<193>-val<200> ç
or Bh<193><218><193>pariccheda of Vi·van<193>tha (<MS>A.D.<D> 1650) ç
with their own commentaries D<200>pik<193> and Siddh<193>ntamukt<193>val<200>.
@S10 = The Sixteen Topics
The Ny<193>ya system enumerates sixteen pad<193>rthas or topics and ç
expounds them in detail. A brief summary of the same may now be attempted ç
here.
These  sixteen  are:  pram<193><207>as (methods of knowing truly), ç
prameyas (objects of the true knowledge), sa<221>·aya (doubt), prayojana ç
(utility, end in view), d<216><218><219><193>nta (example), siddh<193>nta ç
(doctrine), avayava (member of a syllogism), tarka (logic), nir<207>aya ç
(conclusion or final decision), v<193>da (argument to discover the ç
truth),  jalpa  (to  argue  just  to  win), vita<207><195><193> (destructive ç
criticism), hetv<193>bh<193>sa (apparent, but not valid, reason), ç
chala (unfair reply), j<193>ti (false analogy) and nigrahasth<193>na ç
(a ground of defeat in debate).
A few of them may now be dealt with very briefly.
The pram<193><207>as accepted by Ny<193>ya Dar·ana  are  four:  pratyak<218>a  (direct ç
perception), anum<193>na (inference), upa-m<193>na (comparison) and ç
·abda (verbal testimony).
The prameyas are: <193>tman (soul); ·ar<200>ra (body); j<210><193>nendriyas ç
(the five organs of  knowledge  like  the  eyes);  vi<218>ayas (objects ç
of these five indriyas like colour or form); buddhi (cognition, j<210><193>na); ç
upa-labdhi (apprehension); manas (mind); prav<216>tti (activity); ç
do<218>a (mental defects such as r<193>ga or attachment and dve<218>a ç
or aversion); pretyabh<193>va (rebirth); phala (result of activities: ç
pleasure and pain); du<199>kha (suffering); apavarga (absolute liberation ç
from suffering).
@SPACE1 = 
The ultimate aim of a human being is to attain the state of apavarga ç
or mok<218>a wherein there is total cessation of all suffering.  This  is  possible  only  when ç
tattvaj<210><193>na or right knowledge about apavarga and other essentials ç
is obtained. This, again, involves the three famous steps as mentioned ç
in some other systems like the Ved<193>nta Dar·ana, viz., ·rava<207>a ç
(hearing the scriptures), manana (reflecting on the same) and nididhy<193>sana ç
(meditation). The various facets of logic and reasoning, given in ç
the long list of the sixteen pad<193>rthas like sa<221>·aya (doubt), ç
d<216><218><219><193>nta (example), tarka (logic), nir<207>aya (conclusion) ç
and v<193>da (argument), are an aid in this process ofknowing and ç
understanding the truth correctly.
This leads us to the theory of knowledge as propounded by the Ny<193>ya ç
philosophy.
@S10 = The Ny<193>ya Theory of Knowledge
Since the reality of an object can be ascertained truly only by the ç
adoption of suitable methods of knowledge, it is very necessary to ç
have a correct understanding of the latter.
The theory of knowledge as propagated by the Ny<193>ya Dar·ana accepts ç
four pram<193><207>as or distinct and separate sources of true knowledge. ç
They are:
@IN2 = (1)<+>pratyak<218>a (direct perception);<R>ç
(2)<+>anum<193>na (inference);<R>ç
(3)<+>upam<193>na (comparison); and<R>ç
(4)<+>·abda (verbal testimony).
It is but proper to emphasize here that these four pram<193><207>as, ç
when handled correctly, will produce pram<193> or valid knowledge ç
and not apram<193> or non-valid knowledge  as  in  the  case  of  sm<216>ti ç
(memory), sa<221>·aya (doubt) or bhrama (erroneous perception) or ç
a few others already stated as a part of the sixteen pad<193>rthas ç
or topics.
Again, valid knowledge is that which corresponds to the true nature ç
of its object.
Let us now take up these four pram<193><207>as one by one.
@S10N = 1)	Pratyak<218>a (Direct Perception)
When a sense-organ comes into contact with a sense-object†for instance, ç
the eye seeing a table†producing a true, clear and unerring knowledge ç
of that object, it can be called pratyak<218>a. This precludes indefinite ç
or hazy cognition producing a doubt (as in the case of seeing a distant ç
object like a post and doubting whether it is a man or a post) or ç
clearly perceiving a snake in a piece of rope in insufficient light ç
which is actually an illusion. Boththese, though directly perceived, ç
are invalid.
What is internally experienced by the mind, like joy or sorrow, can ç
also be classified under pratyak<218>a.
Extra-sensory perception and intuitive perception by highly spiritually ç
evolved yogis is also included in pratyak<218>a. it is called `yogaja' ç
or `yogipratyak<218>a'.
@S10N = 2)	Anum<193>na (Inference)
Anum<193>na literally means a cognition or knowledge (= m<193>na) ç
which follows (=anu) some other knowledge.
The stock example given to illustrate this is to draw the inference ç
that there is fire onthe yonder hill, by seeing the smoke coming ç
out of it, even though the fire itself is not directly seen.
The syllogism of anum<193>na runs likethis:
@IN2 = There is fire on that yonder hill because it is emitting smoke. ç
It has been seen elsewhere that wherever there is smoke, there is ç
fire. For instance, in the kitchen.
The Ny<193>ya texts use some technical terms while giving this syllogism. ç
Fire, whose presence has to be proved, is called s<193>dhya (major ç
term). The hill, which is the subject under consideration in the course ç
of inferential reasoning, is called pak<218>a (minor term). Smoke ç
which is the mark or sign that indicates the presence of fire is called ç
li<209>ga (middle term) or hetu or s<193>dhana.
The most important factor in such anum<193>na or inferential knowledge ç
is that there must be a relation of invariable concomitance†called ç
`vy<193>pti' in the technical language of ny<193>ya†between the li<209>ga ç
and the s<193>dhya.
The knowledge gained from anum<193>na may be further strengthened ç
by applying the anvaya (agreement in presence) andthe vyatireka (agreement ç
in absence) methods. These two (the positive and thenegative ways ç
of stating the same truth) are respectively illustrated by these sentences: ç
Wherever there is smoke, there is fire. Wherever there is no fire, ç
there is no smoke.
While analysing the subject of anum<193>na, the writers on Ny<193>ya ç
have given several varieties of the same such as sv<193>rtha and par<193>rtha ç
or p<220>rvavat and ·e<218>avat and so on. However, these subtle distinctions ç
do not serve any practical purpose in life, though they may be resorted ç
to in philosophical disputations.
@S10N = 3)	Upam<193>na (Comparison)
Upam<193>na has been defined as the process of naming objects through ç
a given description. For example, a man who does not know what a gavaya ç
(wild cow) is, may be told by a forester that it is an animal very ç
similar to the domestic cow. If, subsequently, he happens to see such ç
an animal in a forest, and immediately recognizes it as a gavaya, ç
his knowledge will be due to upam<193>na.
Some schools of philosophy do not accept upam<193>na as an independent ç
source of knowledge whereas others consider it as a form of anum<193>na ç
itself.
@S10N = 4)	<185>abda (Verbal Testimony)
<185>abda or verbal testimony is defined as the assertion of a trustworthy ç
person and is recognised as the last of the pram<193><207>as.
<185>abda may concern d<216><218><219><193>rtha (relating to perceptible ç
objects) or ad<216><218><219><193>rtha (relating to imperceptible ç
things).
The  latter  includes  supersensible realities like the scriptural ç
statements about God, soul and immortality. Hence the <185>ruti or ç
the Vedas are considered <185>abda in the highest sense.
Since ·abda or verbal testimony is revealed through sentences, the ç
logical structure of a sentence is one of the topics discussed at ç
length in the Ny<193>ya philosophy. The construction of an intelligible ç
sentence must conform to four conditions: <193>k<193><209>k<218><193> ç
(expectancy); yogyat<193> (mutual fitness,   absence   of   contradictions); ç

@S10 = The Ny<193>ya Theory about the Physical World
The Ny<193>ya Dar·ana, which perhaps followed the Vai·e<218>ika Dar·ana ç
in the chronological order, has adopted the theory of creation in ç
toto from the latter. The physical world is the product of the four ç
kinds of param<193><207>us or atoms of p<216>thv<200> (earth), ap ç
(water), tejas (fire) and v<193>yu (air). The physical substance <193>k<193>·a ç
(ether) and the non-physical entities of k<193>la (time) and dik (space) ç
are also involved in the process of creation.
It is ®·vara or God who creates this world out of these material and ç
non- material substances, in accordance with the totality on the ad<216><218><219>as ç
or karmas of the individual souls.
@S10 = ®·vara or God
The Ny<193>ya system accepts ®·vara orGod as the ultimate cause of ç
s<216><218><219>i (creation), sthiti (maintenance) and pralaya (destruction) ç
of the world. However, he does not create the worldout of nothing ç
or out of himself, but out of theeternal atoms, space, time, ether, ç
minds and souls.
Here, creation simply means the ordering of the eternal substances, ç
which are coexistent with God, to form into a moral world shaped according ç
to the karmas of the individual souls. The various physical objects ç
serve as a means to the moral and spiritual ends of their lives.
God is thus the first efficient cause (nimitta-k<193>ra<207>a) and ç
not its material cause. After creation, he<|>also maintains it. He, ç
again, is the moral governor (karma-phalad<193>t<193>) of the world ç
giving awards to the meritorious and punishing the wicked.
He it is, who destroys the world after the cycle is over and as per ç
the moral exigencies. This he does, by letting loose the forces of ç
destruction.
He is omniscient in the sense that he possesses right knowledge of ç
all things and events.
He is endowed with eternal consciousness as an inseparable attribute. ç
Consciousness is not his essence as in the Advaita Ved<193>nta.
He also possesses to the full all the six perfections known as <218>a<195>ai·varyas ç
like j<210><193>na (knowledge), ai·varya (lordship), ya·as (glory), ç
·r<200> (wealth and beauty) and so on.
The Ny<193>ya and the Va<200>·e<218>ika schools give as many as ten ç
reasons for proving the existence of God. However, the most important ç
of them all is that there must be a supremely intelligent agent behind ç
creation wherein almost all the components are inert and the j<200>vas ç
or the souls are ofvery limited knowledge and power. Thestatements ç
in the Vedas†considered as supreme authority in supra-mundane matters†also ç
support this view.
@S10 = J<200>vas or Individual Souls
According to Ny<193>ya Dar·ana, the j<200>vas or individual souls ç
are infinite in number. They are eternal and indestructible. Consciousness ç
is not intrinsic to them but an attribute due tothe association with ç
the mind, which is considered atomic in size. The j<200>vas themselves ç
are vibhu or all-pervading. A j<200>va gets all its experiences when ç
its mind is related tothe outside world through the sense-organs.
The primary aim of life, according to the Ny<193>ya school, as in ç
other philosophical schools, is the attainment of apavarga or mok<218>a, ç
liberation from transmigration. However, unlike the other systems, ç
the Naiy<193>yikas do not accept that it is a state of positive, unbroken ç
and continuous bliss. It is more a state of negation, of the total ç
and permanent absence of all sorrow and suffering. Since the existence ç
of pain and pleasure is always there in life, and that too, due to ç
the association of the mind with the senses and the objects, there ç
can never be a state of pure pleasure or happiness or bliss without ç
pain also. This seems to be the logic behind this negative doctrine.
One can get this liberation only by acquiring tattvaj<210><193>na ç
or true knowledge that he is the spirit distinct from the body and ç
the mind as also the senses. For this he should undergo the threefold ç
s<193>dhan<193> (spiritual discipline) of ·rava<207>a (listening to ç
the spiritual instructions about the <193>tman or the soul), manana ç
(reflection on the same, establishing that knowledge firmly in the ç
mind) and nididhy<193>sana (meditation on the <193>tman in conformity ç
with the final conclusion of the first two modes of s<193>dhan<193>). ç
This will, in course of time, destroy all mithy<193>j<210><193>na ç
or false knowledge. Then the person ceases to be bandied about by ç
passions and impulses which would have led to sorrow, pain and suffering, ç
both physical and mental.
@S10 = Conclusion
One of the charges generally levelled againstthe Indian philosophies, ç
especially the six orthodox systems, is that they are based more on ç
the scriptural authority thanon sound reasoning and convincing logic. ç
The Ny<193>ya Dar·ana has more than compensated for this (apparent) ç
lacuna by its thorough and uncompromising logical methodology.
It has provided a firm basis for thedevelopment of vast polemic literature ç
by the later writers of many schools, especially of Ved<193>nta.

A dar·ana (philosophical system) needs not only an intellectual approach ç
to carry conviction, but also an emotional approach to enthuse the ç
adherent towards s<193>dhan<193> (spiritual discipline).
In the beginning, the Ny<193>ya-Vai·e<218>ika dar·anas hardly possessed ç
the latter element. This was supplied to an admirable extent by Udayana ç
(10th cent. <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) in his masterpiece Ny<193>yakusum<193><210>jali ç
(also called Kusum<193><210>jali).
The work is in 72 k<193>rik<193>s (verses) with the author's own commentary.
Udayana has tried to prove the existence  of  God  by  giving  various ç
inferential proofs such as cause-effect relationship (between God ç
and the world), conjunction of atoms (into dvya<207>uka and so on) ç
needing an intelligent agent, the universe needing a supporting base, ç
need for an intelligent teacher to impart the knowledge of the use ç
of things and the supreme authority of the Vedas.
His great devotion to God and the advocacy of grace in attaining liberation ç
are very palpable in this work.
