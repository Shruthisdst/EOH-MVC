@NID = views. The adherents of Dvaita Ved<193>nta of Madhv<193>c<193>rya ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1238-1317) have contributed quite a voluminous literature ç
in this regard.
The Ny<193>y<193>m<216>ta of Vy<193>sat<200>rtha (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1478-1539)) is one of the best works of this type.
Vy<193>sat<200>rtha†also known as Vy<193>sa-r<193>ya†wrote nine works ç
of which three were considered as his masterpieces. Out of these, ç
again, it is the Ny<193>y<193>m<216>ta that has been regarded as ç
his magnum opus.
The Ny<193>y<193>m<216>ta aims at a thorough vindication of the ç
philosophical power and prestige of the realistic metaphysics of Madhv<193>c<193>rya, ç
dealing simultaneously with the concomitant problems.
The work which is in elegant prose,is divided into four paricchedas ç
or chapters.
The first chapter examines thoroughly the various concepts put forward ç
by Advaita Ved<193>nta such as adhy<193>sa (superimposition), anirvacan<200>yatva ç
(inexplicability), mithy<193>tva (falsity of the world-appearance) ç
and so on.
The second chapter refutes some of the common and well-known advaitic ç
doctrines such as that Brahman is nirgu<207>a (without attributes), ç
nir<193>k<193>ra (formless), svaprak<193>·a (shines by himself) and ç
establishes the doctrine of pa<210>cabhedas (five fundamental differences) ç
which is a basic tenet of Dvaita Ved<193>nta Dar·ana.
The third chapter deals with the correct interpretation of certain ç
statements in the scriptures dealing with s<193>dhan<193>s or spiritual ç
practices.
@SPACE1 = 
The  last  chapter  elucidates  the doctrine of mukti or liberation ç
according to Madhva, refuting the views of other schools.
Thus, this work gives an inkling intothe genius of Vy<193>sat<200>rtha's ç
highly analytical mind.
@NT = Ny<193>yapari·uddhi
@N1-1 = (`[a work that] purifies the Ny<193>ya philosophy')
Next only to R<193>m<193>nuja (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1017-1137) Ved<193>nta ç
De·ika (<MS>A<%14>.<%0>D. <D>1268-1370) was the most important teacher ç
of the philo-sophy of Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita Ved<193>nta. Realising ç
the importance of logic in establishing one's own school and in countering ç
the arguments of the opposing schools, he composed two works<192>the ç
Ny<193>yapari·uddhi and the Ny<193>yasiddh<193><210>jana†which ç
are complementary.
The Ny<193>yas<220>tras of Gautama (550 <MS>B.C.<D>) had been accepted ç
by all the Hindu philosophers who believed in the final authority ç
of the Vedas as a basic work of logic. However, the commentators who ç
developed the Ny<193>ya system, paid overwhelming attention to the ç
pram<193><207>as (means of knowledge) rather than the prameyas (objects ç
of knowledge).
With a view to `purifying' or correcting this imbalance (pari·uddhi ç
= purifying), De·ika wrote these two works wherein he has tried to ç
show that the philosophy of the Ny<193>yas<220>tras with regard ç
to the pram<193><207>as, is the same as that of Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita ç
Ved<193>nta.
This work has five chapters. They are: pratyak<218><193>dhy<193>ya, ç
anum<193>n<193>dhy<193>ya, ·abd<193>dhy<193>ya, sm<216>tyadhy<193>ya ç
and pramey<193>-dhy<193>ya.
They respectively deal with the subjects of direct perception, inference, ç
scriptural testimony, the secondary scriptures and the objects of ç
knowledge like the world, the soul and God.
The second chapter is the longest.
Since he could not amplify the prameya part sufficiently in this work, ç
he wrote the second work, the Ny<193>ya-siddh<193><210>jana, wherein ç
his objective was fulfilled.
@NT = ny<193>yas
@N1 = (`maxims')
Experience is a great teacher in life. If it results in an instinctive ç
reaction or behaviour in animals, in the human beings it can inspire ç
a whole philosophy of life. Such philosophies of life are often expressed ç
by him in short pithy sayings that go by such terms as an adage, a ç
maxim, a proverb, an epigram or a saying.
Ny<193>yas are such maxims which are widely used in Sanskrit literature, ç
both secular and religio-philosophical.
Various scholars have battled for years to collect such ny<193>yas ç
and expound them with quotations from famous works.
A few such ny<193>yas may now be given †arranged in the English alphabetical ç
order†as  specimens  of  such  maxim- literature:
@S10N = Andhagaja Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of the blind men and the ç
elephant')
Six blind men went to `see' an elephant. They touched its different ç
limbs and came to different conclusions about its shape such as a ç
pillar, a winnowing basket, a rope and so on.
This ny<193>ya is used to illustrate the divergent views of philosophers ç
regarding God, due to a partial understanding.
@S10N = B<200>j<193><209>kura Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of the seed<R>ç
and the shoot')
A b<200>ja (seed) gives rise to an a<209>kura (sprout or shoot) which ç
in time, grows into a plant or a tree and produces b<200>jas. This ç
series of seeds and shoots goes on endlessly.
@EMERGENCY = Similarly if in any solution offered, the result begs ç
the question itself, then, by this ny<193>ya, it is no solution or ç
proof and hence has to be ignored.
@S10N = Chatri Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of men with<R>ç
umbrellas')
@EMERGENCY = When a group of men is going and only a few of them are ç
holding umbrellas, from a distance it appears as though all of them ç
are carrying umbrellas.
@EMERGENCY = This maxim is applied to such situations where the particular ç
is applied to the general though it is not true.
@S10N = Dehal<200>d<200>pa Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of the lamp<R>ç
on the threshold')
@EMERGENCY = A lamp kept on the threshold of a house gives light not ç
only inside but also outside. Similarly, sometimes, a particular word ç
is used in certain sentences in such a way that its meaning can be ç
connected both to the preceding and to the succeeding words.
@S10N = Gu<195>ajihvik<193> Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of smearing<R>ç
the tongue with treacle')
@EMERGENCY = It means smearing the tongue with a sweet substance like ç
jaggery before administering a bitter medicine. The idea is similar ç
to that of the `sugar-coated pill'.
@EMERGENCY = It is applied to such cases where an apparently unpleasant ç
lesson has to be taught, but is done cleverly through pleasant stories ç
or some such method.
@S10N = Hradanakra Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of the lake<R>ç
and the crocodile')
@EMERGENCY = The lake gives the crocodile shelter and protects it. ç
The presence of the crocodile protects the lake also since other animals ç
or human beings will be afraid to use its water.
This maxim reflects the idea of mutual dependence resulting in mutual ç
protection.
@S10N = I<218>uvega Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of the speed of<R>ç
the arrow')
When an arrow is discharged from the bow, its speed gradually gets ç
reduced and hence it comes to a stop after some time.
Similarly the experiences brought about by pr<193>rabdha karma (See ç
<MS>KARMA<D> for details.)†whether good or bad†will not last eternally, ç
but gradually come to a stop. Hence, one should not brood over them!
@S10N = Jalakatakare<207>u Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of the<R>ç
powder of the kataka-nut [added to] water')
In the olden days, people used to smear the powder of the kataka-nuts ç
(Strychnos potatosum) inside water jars, to precipitate the particles ç
of mud. The powder also, along with the particles of mud, would settle ç
down at the bottom, leaving the water above, crystal clear.
This simile is generally used in the works on Advaita Ved<193>nta ç
to indicate that j<210><193>na (knowledge), after removing aj<210><193>na ç
(nescience), will itself disappear, leaving the <193>tman to shine ç
in all its glory.
Accepting the disappearance of j<210><193>na also, along with aj<210><193>na, ç
was a logical necessity for Advaita Ved<193>nta, since the simultaneous ç
existence of j<210><193>na and the <193>tman would cut at the very ç
root of its basic premise.
@S10N = Lo<218><219>aprastara Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of a clod<R>ç
of earth and stone')
This ny<193>ya has been used in two senses. Compared to a cotton ball, ç
a clod of earth may be hard. But, it is quite soft when compared to ç
a piece of stone. Similarly, in this world, all qualities are relative ç
in character.
According to the second interpretation, if a clod of earth `attacks' ç
a piece of stone, thinking that it is hard enough to break the stone, ç
it itself gets destroyed in the process. The lesson is that one should ç
never try to attack anyone who is much stronger than oneself.
@S10N = M<193>tsya Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of, or the simile drawn ç
from, fish')
In a pond or a tank, the big and powerful fish eat up the smaller, ç
weaker, ones.
This simile, drawn from this fact, indicates the oppression of the ç
weak by the strong, thereby lamenting the fact that might is right!
@S10N = Nad<200>samudra Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of the<R>ç
river and the ocean')
When a river flows into an ocean, it loses its separate identity.
Similarly  when  the  j<200>va  (the individual soul) realises Brahman ç
(or God), becomes one with Him after the death of the body. This, ç
of course, is from the standpoint of Advaita Ved<193>nta.
@S10N = Pa<209>gvandha Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of the lame<R>ç
and the blind')
Once, a lame man and a blind man lost their way in a forest. When ç
they accidentally met, they struck a deal. The blind man would carry ç
the lame man and the latter, who could see well, would guide the blind ç
one on the right road. Ultimately, both of them succeeded in coming ç
out and reached their homes safely.
This story indicates the possibility of a successful venture if people ç
cooperate with one another properly.
This analogy is used by the S<193><209>khyan metaphysics to explain ç
how the insentient pradh<193>na (Mother Nature, basic matrix of the ç
insentient objects of creation) and the sentient puru<218>a (individual ç
soul) cooperate to evolve this world.
@S10N = Rajjusarpa Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of the rope<R>ç
[appearing as a] serpent')
In semidarkness, a piece of rope lying on the road may appear as a ç
snake, producing fear in the mind of the person who sees it. This ç
illusion disappears when it is actually seen in bright light.
This illustration is widely used by the writers of Advaita Ved<193>nta ç
to explain how Brahman, the one without a second, appears as this ç
world of multiple objects with different names and shapes. It isavidy<193> ç
or aj<210><193>na (nescience) that is responsible for this illusion.
@S10N = Sth<220><207><193>nikhanana Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of the<R>ç
driving in of a post')
In order to drive a post into the ground firmly, it is repeatedly ç
hammered and shaken.
Similarly, to drive home a point, arguments of various types and standpoints ç
have to be brought forward.
@S10N = T<216><207>ajal<193>yuka Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of the<R>ç
caterpillar')
A caterpillar, perching at the edge of a grass blade, will first catch ç
by its mouth, the edge of another grass-leaf next to it, before leaving ç
the first.
Similarly, the j<200>va (soul) leaving the body at the time of death, ç
catches hold of another body created by his pr<193>rabdha-karma, before ç
leaving the previous one.
In the world, one is advised†by this ny<193>ya†to secure the next ç
foothold before abandoning the one already in hand.
@S10N = <188><218>arav<216><218><219>i Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of ç
rain on<R>ç
desert land')
No amount of rain on a desert land can make it fertile enough to grow ç
crops.
Similarly, any effort at achieving something in life, will become ç
fruitless, if the rules of the game are not strictly and sincerely ç
followed.
@S10N = Viha<209>gama Ny<193>ya (`the maxim of the bird')
Though an ant as also a monkey are capable of climbing up a tree to ç
taste its juicy fruits, it is the bird that can do it more easily ç
and much faster.
Similarly, more capable and efficient persons can achieve the fruits ç
of their labour in any enterprise very speedily.
@S10N = Ya<199> k<193>rayati sa karotyeva iti Ny<193>ya (`the  maxim ç
that he who causes a thing to be<R>ç
one is [also] verily the doer')
According to this maxim, if A gets something done through B†whether ç
it is good or bad†he also is responsible for the results (merit or ç
demerit) of that act.
Hence, the Hindu scriptures advise all not only not to commit evil ç
deeds but also to desist from getting them done through others, nor ç
even approve of it if done by others.
The number of such ny<193>yas is very large and have proved to be ç
extremely popular. They have been aptly used not only in secular literature ç
but also in religious and philosophical works.
@NT = Ny<193>yasudh<193>
@N1KERN = (`nectar of logical exposition')
Out of the six systems of Hindu philosophy, the Ved<193>nta Dar·ana ç
has gained for itself, a pre-eminent place.
Of the several branches of Ved<193>nta, the Dvaita school of Madhv<193>c<193>rya ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1238-1317) has developed a very powerful system of ç
logic aimed at vanquishing other schools, especially the Advaita Ved<193>nta.
Madhva composed his Anuvy<193>khy<193>na, a metrical work giving ç
the gist of his philosophy based on the Brahmas<220>tras. Jayat<200>rtha ç
(14t<%22>h<%0>cent. <MS>A.D.<D>) wrote a detailed commentary on this ç
work, known as Ny<193>yasudh<193>. On this, there is a subcommentary ç
called Ny<193>yasudh<193>parimala or, simply, Parimala, by Raghavendrat<200>rtha ç
(<MS>A.D.<D> 1598-1671)
Comprising 24,000 granthas or verses, the Ny<193>yasudh<193>†also ç
known as Vi<218>amapadav<193>ky<193>rthaviv<216>ti†is a first rate ç
classic and a superb work of polemical literature. It is a highly ç
illuminating commentary on the Anuvy<193>khy<193>na.
It critically examines the various views and schools of philosophy ç
like those of <185>a<209>kara, R<193>m<193>nuja, Bh<193>skara, V<193>caspati ç
as well as those of the works like S<193><209>khyatattvakaumud<200>, ç
Ny<193>ya-kusum<193><210>jali, Kha<207><195>anakha<207><195>akh<193>dya ç
and Citsukh<200> and tries to show their inadequacy.
It also tries to answer effectively the objections and criticisms ç
against Madhva's doctrines by later writers.
The Advaitasiddhi of Madhus<220>dana Sarasvat<200> (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1490-1580) was written as a reply to this work.
