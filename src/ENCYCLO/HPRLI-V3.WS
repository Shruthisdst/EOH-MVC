@H = Preface
@PREF = Hinduism is a great religion. The traditionalists however ç
prefer to call it `San<193>tana Dharma'. Perhaps, this is a far better ç
term that reflects its true meaning and significance. The word dharma ç
is generally used to denote religion, the path to perfection or beatitude. ç
`San<193>tana' means `ancient' as also `eternal'. Hence the expression ç
means `the religion or thepath of spiritual discipline that is not ç
only ancient but also eternal'. In other words, Hinduism has been ç
offering an unbroken continuous tradition of spiritual discipline ç
which is not only very ancient but also relevant even to the modern ç
times. The beauty of this tradition is that it proffers several alternatives ç
that can suit different types of s<193>dhakas (aspirants) instead ç
of prescribing the same cap for every head. Thus, starting from the ç
aspirant at the highest rung of the spiritual ladder who is fit to ç
meditate on the non-dual Brahman (the Absolute), right up to the tyro ç
worshipping the images, everyone has a place specially carved out ç
for him.
@PREF = Of late, study of Hinduism is drawing the attention of scholars ç
both from India and from other countries. However, books on general ç
Hinduism covering all aspects are not many. Even the few that are ç
available deal with subjects like the Upani<218>ads, the Bhagavadg<200>t<193>, ç
Ved<193>nta systems and Yoga philosophy in greater detail ignoring ç
other aspects relevant to popular Hinduism.
@PREF = Hence there is a great need for an exhaustive omnibus type ç
of work.
@PREF = There were two choices before me:
@NPREF = 1.
@NKPREF = To prepare a comprehensive work with several chapters touching ç
on all aspects of Hinduism.
@NPREF = 2.
@NKPREF = To work on a regular encyclopaedia of Hinduism, arranging ç
the various subjects in the English alphabetical order.
@PREF = After weighing the pros and cons, I decided in favour of the ç
latter since it would be much easier for the average reader to locate ç
the subject he wants to know.
@PREF = This is now in your hands.
@PREF = The entries have been arranged in the English alphabetical ç
order.Since most of the subject headings are in Sanskrit, standard ç
diacritical marks as approved by the International Alphabet of Sanskrit ç
Transliteration and based on a standard established by the Congress ç
of Orientalists at Athens in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1912 have been adopted. ç
However, while arranging the titles in the alphabetical order, the ç
diacritical marks have been ignored to facilitate easy recognition.
@PREF = As for the subject content, the following are the main topics ç
dealt with in greater detail: religion, philosophy, mythology, rituals, ç
scriptural works, festivals and pilgrim centres.
@PREF = Other topics described include astrology, biographies of religious ç
personalities, iconography, Sanskrit language and literature, temples ç
and religious institutions.
@PREF = Care has been taken to deal with the four Vedas, their subsidiary ç
works and allied literature. Several important Vedic S<220>ktas, y<193>gas ç
or sacrifices as also unfamiliar concepts and terms have also been ç
described.
@PREF = Along with the major Upani<218>ads and the Mah<193>pur<193><207>as, ç
several minor Upani<218>ads and the upapur<193><207>as too have been ç
dealt with.
@PREF = While the essay on the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a is fairly exhaustive, ç
the one on the Mah<193>bh<193>rata is more condensed because of ç
its immense size. However, the various topics dealt with in it like ç
dharma or the minor G<200>t<193>s or the Yak<218>apra·na do find ç
a place as independent articles.
@PREF = Since most of the <193>gamas and tantras are still in the ç
manuscript form, justice could not be done to this subject area. Only ç
a few major ones, more well-known, have been delineated.
@PREF = Since Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism are closely allied to ç
Hinduism they too have been described briefly along with the biographies ç
of their founders.
@PREF = Now, a word about the language: The Basic Manual of Style ç
given in standard dictionaries has been closely followed as far as ç
possible. Use of capital letters has been minimised. Italics have ç
been used to indicate the titles of books and works as also foreign ç
words. In the body of the work, all Sanskrit words are given in the ç
usual Roman script only except in rare cases where found necessary ç
italics have been used. All references to works quoted have been given ç
in full, avoiding abbreviations.
@PREF = Line-drawings as also halftone pictures have been given in ç
the body of the work itself under the respective titles. Photographs ç
have been given separately in a bunch at the appropriate places.
@PREF = Brief biographical notes of the better known Indologists have ç
been given at the end as appendices.
@PREF = A work of this dimension could not have been accomplished ç
without academic help from various quarters. However, only a select ç
bibliography has been prepared and added at the end. Small booklets ç
and articles which have also been consulted, have not been mentioned ç
since they are too numerous to do so.
@PREF = This stupendous task, normally undertaken by institutions, ç
has some how been completed†it was started in 1975†solely by the grace ç
of God. It is being dedicated to <185>r<200> S<193>rad<193>dev<200>†better ç
known as the Holy Mother†the Divine Spouse of the Divine Lord, Bhagav<193>n ç
<185>r<200> R<193>mak<216><218><207>a Paramaha<221>sadeva.
@PREF = I earnestly hope that the students of Hinduism as also the ç
Hindu society will find this work useful in understanding the essence ç
of Hinduism in the right spirit.
