@NID = looks! Ashamed of his behaviour and astonished at her psychic ç
insight, he asked her for guidance. After declaring that she got everything ç
by devotedly serving her husband, she directed him to another great ç
teacher Dharmavy<193>dha. Kau·ika went to him and was fully enlightened ç
on the various aspects and secrets of dharma.
Kau·ika is also the name of another sage, a simpleton, who spoke the ç
`truth' about some travellers who were hiding in his hermitage, to ç
the robbers pursuing them. These robbers killed those travellers and ç
took away their belongings. A part of this sin accrued to Kau·ika ç
also. The lesson of this episode is that truth should bring about ç
what is good to people. What harms them, though it may be a literal ç
truth, is not truth in the real sense (Mah<193>bh<193>rata, Kar<207>aparva ç
72).
There is a dharma·<193>stra attributed to one Kau·ika. He has been ç
quoted by other writers but the original is not available now.
Kau·ika was also the name of Vi·v<193>mitra because he was the grandson ç
of Ku·a.

The Atharvaveda (also spelt as the Atharva<207>aveda) is the last ç
of the four Vedas. Chronologically speaking, it is perhaps a later ç
composition. That is why, not only is its language more sophisticated ç
and philosophical ideas more clear, it also includes many subjects ç
of social importance, more fully developed.
Five S<220>tra works are attached to this Veda as detailed appendices, ç
expounding the rites and concepts in greater detail. They are: Kau·ika ç
S<220>tras, Vait<193>na S<220>tras, Nak<218>atrakalpa S<220>tras, ç
°<209>girasakalpa S<220>tras and <185><193>ntikalpa S<220>tras.
The  Kau·ika  S<220>tras†sometimes titled as Kau·ika G<216>hyas<220>tras ç
also†is an independent work attributed to the sage Kau·ika about whom ç
nothing is known. Though the Vedic scholars generally agree that this ç
is the oldest of the five works mentioned, no possible date has been ç
assigned to it.
It has 14 adhy<193>yas or chapters. Each adhy<193>ya has several ka<207><195>ik<193>s ç
or sections, the ka<207><195>ik<193>s, again, comprising several individual ç
s<220>tras. There are 3008 s<220>tras distributed among 141 ka<207><195>ik<193>s.
A commentary called Kau·ikabh<193><218>ya by D<193>rila (or H<193>rila) ç
and a Paddhati (gloss) by one Ke·ava, son of Some·vara, are available. ç
The former work is incomplete and ends at the 48th ka<207><195>ik<193>, ç
the rest being, perhaps, lost for ever.
Bha<219><219><193>ribha<219><219>a and V<193>sudeva are two other ç
commentators mentioned by some scholars.
The contents of the s<220>tras embrace a variety of subjects ranging ç
from Vedic sacrifices right up to medical science and black magic.
A very brief summary of subjects may now be attempted here:
@SPACE1 = 
Dar·a and P<220>r<207>am<193>sa sacrifices; various rites for getting ç
wisdom, securing desires,  harmony,  power,  aversion  of misfortunes ç
and so on; different kinds of charms and amulets for securing property, ç
cattle and safety of long journeys; remedial charms for curing diseases; ç
rites and rituals  connected  with  women  and progeny; protection ç
against the vagaries of nature, to get rains and crops; countering ç
the effect of witchcraft; coronation of a king; Vedic studies; morning ç
and evening oblations; pr<193>ya·cittas or expiatory rites; sa<221>sk<193>ras ç
like upanayana, viv<193>ha (marriage) and funeral rites; various omens ç
and portents.

@NT = Kau<218><200>taki Br<193>hma<207>a
The Vedas are generally divided into two sections: the Mantra and ç
the Br<193>hma<207>a. Sometimes, this division is extended by rearranging ç
and adding two more sections, the °ra<207>yaka and the Upani<218>ad.
The Kau<218><200>taki Br<193>hma<207>a (2500 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) (also ç
called <185><193><209>kh<193>yana Br<193>hma<207>a) is one of the ç
two Br<193>hma<207>as of the <184>gveda that is available now, the ç
other one being Aitareya Br<193>hma<207>a. While some scholars feel ç
that the Kau<218><200>taki and the <185><193><209>kh<193>yana  ç
Br<193>hma<207>as  are  different, others opine that the former belongs ç
to the <185><193><209>kh<193>yana-·<193>kh<193> or recension and hence ç
the same. There is a third view that <185><193><209>kh<193>yana was ç
a disciple of Kau<218><200>taki and the author could be either of ç
them.
There are 30 adhy<193>yas or chapters divided into 226 kha<207><195>as ç
or sections. Each kha<207><195>a contains long passages in prose.
Like the Aitareya Br<193>hma<207>a, this work also devotes the major ç
part to the delineation of the details of sacrifices like Agny<193>dh<193>na, ç
Agnihotra, Dar·ap<220>r<207>a-m<193>sa, C<193>turm<193>sya and Somay<193>gas.
A few special features of this Br<193>hma<207>a may now be given:
1.<+>The tradition of gotras and pravaras had already taken root in ç
the society.
2.<+>The <216><218>is were well-versed in the science of health. They ç
had recognised that certain diseases appear as a result of the change ç
of seasons.
3.<+>There were kings with large and disciplined armies.
4.<+>People in North India were experts in Grammar.
5.<+>The names of the lunar months like Caitra and Vai·<193>kha are ç
mentioned here. So also the eight names of <185>iva like Rudra and ç
Pa·upati. Vi<218><207>u and <185>iva seem to have been equally honoured.
6.<+>Immolation of animals in sacrifices and flesh-eating have been ç
condemned.

@NT = Kau<218><200>taki Br<193>hma<207>a Upani<218>ad
Though not counted among the ten important Upani<218>ads†popularly ç
called `Da·opani<218>ads'†the Kau<218><200>taki Br<193>hma<207>a ç
Upani<218>ad is nevertheless considered as a very ancient and important ç
Upani<218>ad. Twoof its statements (vide 3.2; 3.8; 4.19) have been ç
discussed in the Brahmas<220>tras (1.1.28-31; 1.4.16-18).
Also known as Kau<218><200>taki or Kau<218><200>taka Upani<218>ad, ç
it forms chapters 3 to 6 of the 15 chapters of the Kau<218><200>taki ç
°ra<207>yaka which itself is attached to the Br<193>hma<207>a of ç
the same name.
It is a fairly long work in four adhy<193>yas or chapters. Each of ç
these contains long prose passages, the total number  of  such passages  being  32, ç
comprising 697 sentences.
The Upani<218>ad opens with a narrative, leading to a discussion on ç
eschatology. Citra G<193><209>gy<193>yani, a king, invites °ru<207>i ç
to be the chief priest of the sacrifice he was going to conduct. °ru<207>i ç
deputes his son <185>vetaketu for it. However, on seeing the young ç
<185>vetaketu, the king puts him a question about the world where ç
he would be placed (after death) after the performance of the sacrifice. ç
Since <185>vetaketu did not know the answer, he goes back to his father ç
to know the same.
The father too, is ignorant of the answer and hence comes back to ç
the king for being instructed, along with his son. (Compare this with ç
Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad 5.3.1-5).
Though this is against the normal tradition (that a br<193>hma<207>a ç
should become a disciple of a k<218>attriya), the king accedes to ç
his request.
Those inferior s<193>dhakas who die here, go to the Candraloka, the ç
world of Moon, the same as svarga or heaven. After exhausting their ç
pu<207>ya or merit, they return to this world.
Those, on the other hand, who have performedni<218>k<193>makarmaordesireless ç
actions and up<193>san<193> or meditation on God, go to Brahmaloka ç
by the devay<193>na path, the path of gods.
There is a highly poetic description of Brahmaloka in this section.
The new entrant is received with great pomp by five hundred apsaras ç
or nymphs. He then comes to the lake °ra, but crosses it by his mind. ç
He later crosses the river Viraj<193>, also with his mind, shaking ç
off his good and evil deeds.
@SPACE1 = 
There are other descriptions of his coming to a divine tree called ç
Ilya, the city S<193>lajja, entering the abode Apar<193>jit<193>, ç
the hall Vibhu, the throne Vicak<218>a<207>a, the conch Amitaujas ç
and so on. Obviously all these symbolise his gaining greater and greater ç
glory of Brahm<193>.
The second chapter is concerned mainly with the pr<193><207>a, the ç
vital breath and its up<193>san<193> or meditation. Pr<193><207>a, ç
equated to Brahman, is imagined as an emperor being served by the ç
senses and the mind.
A rite called `Ekadhan<193>varodhana' is described to enable the V<193>naprastha ç
or the forest recluse to obtain wealth that is necessary for performing ç
any sacrifice.
The internal Agnihotra and some up<193>san<193>s in the form of japa ç
of certain mantras attributed to Pratardana and Sarvajit Kau<218><200>taki ç
are described next.
Rites for preventing the death of children before one's own, for the ç
long life of sons, the superiority of the mukhya-pr<193><207>a or ç
chief pr<193><207>a over all the sense-organs and the samprad<193>na-karma ç
wherein the father on his death-bed transmits his energies to his ç
son are the other items described here.
The third chapter starts with an ancient anecdote. Pratardana, a great ç
king, after death goes to the world of Indra. He is offered a boon ç
by Indra. On Pratardana requesting Indra to choose anappropriate ç
boon for himself, Indra starts teaching him about mukhyapr<193><207>a ç
(the chief pr<193><207>a), which he himself has attained. This mukhyapr<193><207>a ç
is praj<210><193>, intelligence or consciousness. It itself is Brahman.
This chapter ends with a description of the departure of the mukhyapr<193><207>a ç
from the body along with all the senses.
@SPACE1 = 
The fourth†the last†chapter starts with a dialogue between the proud ç
B<193>l<193>ki, a descendant of the sage Garga, and the king Aj<193>ta·atru. ç
Though, at first, B<193>l<193>ki starts teaching the king, he very ç
soon discovers to his dismay that the king is far superior in the ç
knowledge of Brahman! The king then teaches him that it is the <193>tman, ç
the pure consciousness, which is pervading the whole body and which ç
is behind all the senses. One who knows this <193>tman becomes the ç
sovereign, attains overlordship.

@NT = Kau<218><200>taki G<216>hyas<220>tras
@SPACE = 
The g<216>hyas<220>tras and the dharma-s<220>tras are, in a way, forerunners ç
of the later dharma·<193>stra literature. The Kau<218><200>taki G<216>hyas<220>tras, ç
belonging to the <184>gveda is attributed to the sage <185><193>mbavya. ç
Hence it is also called <185><193>mbavya G<216>hyas<220>tras.
It is in five adhy<193>yas or chapters, each containing a number of ç
s<220>tras. The topics of upanayana (investiture with sacred thread) ç
and viv<193>ha (marriage) are dealt with in great detail. <185>r<193>ddha ç
(obsequial rites) is another subject that finds a place here.
@NT = Kaustubha
@N1 = (`that which pervades [the universe]')
According to the various systems of Hindu philosophy and the mystical ç
traditions, God is both nir<193>k<193>ra (without any particular form) ç
and nirgu<207>a (without attributes) as also s<193>k<193>ra and sagu<207>a ç
(with form and attributes).
One of the most widely known (even from the Vedic period) and worshipped ç
forms of God is that of Vi<218><207>u-N<193>r<193>ya<207>a.
Detailed descriptions of Vi<218><207>u-N<193>r<193>-ya<207>a as found ç
in the Hindu epics and the pur<193><207>as state that he wears an ç
extra- ordinarily brilliant and beautiful gem called ``Kaustubha'' ç
on his chest, covering the <185>r<200>vatsa mark there.
This gem is said to have emerged out of the k<218><200>rasamudra or ç
the ocean of milk at the time of its churning. (See <MS>SAMUDRAMATHANA<D> ç
for details.) It got lodged on Vi<218><207>u's chest by itself (Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
°diparva 18).
Literally, the word `Kaustubha' means `that which pervades the whole ç
universe'. Symbolically, it stands for all that enjoys (bhokt<193>), ç
the <185>r<200>vatsa mark representing all that is enjoyed (bhogya). ç
The two together represent the created universe in all its aspects ç
which itself is like an ornament for God.

@NT = Kautsas<220>kta
Sins and their expiation is one of the important subjects dealt with ç
in the sm<216>tis and dharma·<193>stras. Apart from pa·c<193>tt<193>pa ç
(regretting for having committed the sins) which is a prerequisite, ç
many modes are described for getting rid of or for lessening the effects ç
of sins. One such is japa or the muttering of some Vedic mantras.
The Manusm<216>ti (11.249) mentions that by the japa of the Kautsa ç
(s<220>kta) even a drinker of sur<193> or wine becomes pure.
@NID = <+><+><+><|>The eight mantras of <184>gveda (1.97.1-8) attributed ç
to the sage Kautsa are known as the Kautsas<220>kta. The sage Kautsa ç
is said to have prayed to Agni (the god of fire) for freeing him from ç
the sin of killing a woman.
He had killed a demoness called D<200>rghajihv<200> at the instance ç
of Indra, since she was troubling the sages engaged in the performance ç
of sacrifices.
All the eight <216>ks of this s<220>kta end with the words ap na<199> ç
·o·ucadagham, `May our sin depart from us!'
@NT = Kautukabera
@N1 = (`image with thread')
Hindu temples have two types of images: the one fixed permanently ç
in the garbhag<216>ha or sanctum sanctorum called `dhruvabera' and ç
the one kept separately in a room or a shed, which is used during ç
the processions on special days. This processional image is normally ç
a smaller replica of the original image, made of pa<210>caloha or ç
bronze and is called `utsava-m<220>rti'.
`Kautuka' is the technical name for a sacred thread that is wound ç
round the right wrist of the utsavam<220>rti on the night prior to ç
the rathotsava or procession- festival. Hence, this utsavam<220>rti ç
is also called `Kautukabera'.

@NT = Kava<218>a Ail<220><218>a
@N1KERN = (`Kava<218>a, the son of Il<220><218>a')
One of the characteristics of the Hindu scriptures is frankness and ç
directness whether it concerns good or evil. Also, if an idea considered ç
as right was later found to be wrong, it was unceremoniously discarded ç
and replaced with the right one. The story of Kava<218>a Ail<220><218>a ç
is such an illustration. 
Kava<218>a, the son of Il<220><218>a was born to a ·<220>dra woman ç
who was a slave and hence was castigated by the contemporary society ç
of br<193>hma<207>a sages. He could neither enter a place of sacrifice ç
nor even have social contacts with the br<193>hma<207>as of his times.
Once, when some sages like the Bh<216>gus and the A<209>girasas were ç
performing a Sattray<193>ga, they found that Kava<218>a Ail<220><218>a ç
was also sitting there amongst them. When they discovered this, they ç
promptly evicted him from there, and forcibly banished him to a desert. ç
However, when Kava<218>a was languishing there, by divine grace, a ç
Vedics<220>kta was revealed to him. This is known as the Aponaptr<200>ya ç
hymn (<184>gveda 10.30.1-15) and is used in Somay<193>gas. It is ç
chanted by the Hot<216> priest. The presiding deities of water were ç
pleased with him. As a result, the river Sarasvat<200> started circumambulating ç
him and the place became fertile.
Learning of this miracle, the sages who  were  performing  the  Sattray<193>ga ç
hurriedly came to him, apologised to him for their arrogance and invited ç
him to participate  in  their  sacrifice  as  an honoured priest.
This story appears in the Aitareya Br<193>hma<207>a (8.19) and also ç
in the Kau<218><200>taki Br<193>hma<207>a (12.3).
Another Kava<218>a is mentioned in the <184>gveda (7.18.12) as one ç
who was overthrown by Indra. He was probably the priest of the tribe ç
named `Vaikar<207>a'.
@NT = K<193>ver<200>
@N1 = (`daughter of the king Kavera')
Hinduism  has  always  considered rivers and mountains as sacred spots ç
since they are conducive to the practice of spiritual disciplines.
K<193>ver<200> (often called `Dak<218><200><207>aga<209>g<193>') is ç
one of the seven most sacred rivers of India included in the mantra ç
invoking the seven rivers, at the time of ritualistic worship.
Taking its birth in the Brahmagiri hill of the district of Ko<195>agu ç
(or Coorg) in Karnataka, it flows in the south-easterly direction ç
through the Mysore and the Tanjavur (Tanjore) districts of Karnataka ç
and Tamil Nadu states, ultimately merging in the Bay of Bengal near ç
the small town Kaveripattinam. Its total length is 760 kms. (475 miles).
The place where it emerges out of the womb of earth is called Talak<193>ver<200>. ç
It is 39 kms. (24 miles) from the central town of Madikeri and 8 kms. ç
(5 miles) from the little town of Bh<193>gama<207><195>ala. The place ç
of its emergence named Ku<207><195>ige is just a little pool 0.6 metre ç
squre (2 feet square). To its north is a small ma<207><219>apa (temple-like ç
structure) about 1.2 meters (4 ft) in height. The water of the Ku<207><195>ige ç
gets accumulated in a small tank and then flows out under the ground.
@SPACE1 = 
Every year, during Tul<193>sa<209>krama<207>a (i.e., when the sun ç
enters the Libra, generally during October), at a particular moment ç
of the day, there is a sudden bursting forth of water in the small ç
pond Ku<207><195>ige. On this day, thousands of people gather there ç
to offer worship to the goddess K<193>ver<200>, bathe in the tank ç
and also carry home a little of the holy water.
There are several stories in the epics and the pur<193><207>as regarding ç
the river and the river-goddess K<193>ver<200>.
She was the foster-daughter (known earlier as Vi<218><207>um<193>y<193>) ç
brought up by the king Kavera and hence called `K<193>ver<200>'. She ç
was also known as `Lop<193>mudr<193>' and was given in marriage to ç
the sage Agastya. Once when Agastya was travelling to the south of ç
the country beyond the Vindhya mountains, he was carrying her in the ç
form of water in his kama<207><195>alu (water pot of mendicants) which ç
was upset by a powerful wind near the Sahy<193>dri mountain from where ç
she started flowing as a river.
Other stories are similar but add that she was originally a river ç
flowing in Kail<193>sa, the abode of <185>iva.
A large number of small rivers and rivulets join it at various places. ç
Well-known centres of pilgimage situated on its banksare: <185>r<200>ra<209>gam ç
in Tamil Nadu; <185>r<200>ra<209>gapa<219><219>a<207>a near Mysore ç
in Karna-taka; Madhyara<209>ga temple near Shivana-samudra in Karnataka ç
state.
In all these three places which are small islands in the river, there ç
are temples of Ra<209>gan<193>tha, an aspect of Vi<218><207>u in the ç
reclining posture.
The famous <185>aiva temples on its banks are those at Cidambaram ç
and Ta<210>j<193>vur (B<216>had<200>·vara Mah<193>deva). Mention may ç
be made of the Jambuke·vara temple near <185>r<200>ra<209>gam also.
Tiruj<210><193>na Sambandhar, the well-known <185>aiva saint, was ç
born on the bank of K<193>ver<200>. Kamban, the famous poet, is said ç
to have composed his R<193>m<193>ya<207>a in Tamil, on the bank ç
of this river.

@NT = k<193>yasampat
@N1 = (`wealth of the body')
The Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.C.<D>) is the most ç
authoritative work on the science of yoga.
In the third chapter titled Vibh<220>ti-p<193>da, Pata<210>jali ç
has listed a large number of siddhis or extraordinary powers that ç
a yogi develops as a result of sa<221>yama (meditation leading to ç
sam<193>dhi or superconscious experience) on a variety of objects.
When sa<221>yama is practised on the pa<210>cabh<220>tas or the five ç
basic elements† earth, water, fire, air and sky or ether†the yogi ç
develops a<218><219>asiddhis (See <MS>A<186><187>A-SIDDHIS<D>.) or ç
the eight special powers like becoming small or big, light or heavy ç
and so on, at will. Along with these eight powers, he also gets two ç
more powers: k<193>yasampat (`wealth of the body') and transcending ç
the obstacles of the five elements. K<193>yasampat pertains to the ç
body of the yogi. His body will be very hand- some, perfectly proportionate ç
and will have great strength as also Vajrasa<221>hananatva or very ç
hard muscular structure.
Hanum<193>n is given as an example of the last quality.
@NT = k<193>yastha
The var<207>a system and its offshoot, the caste system, have been ç
an integral part of the Hindu society over the millennia. As the society ç
progressed in civilisation with more and more professions and avenues ç
of earning wealth being addedon, the number of castes also got multiplied.
The `k<193>yastha' is one such caste which is not mentioned in the ç
ancient dharmas<220>tras.  However,  the  Vi<218><207>u- dharmas<220>tras ç
(7.3) assigned to the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 300-700, mentions the word, ç
but only in the sense of an accountant. It must have acquired the ç
sense of caste at a later period.
As regards the hierarchy of the k<193>yasthas among the var<207>as ç
and castes there seem to be differences of opinion. Some High Courts ç
have assigned to them the position of dvij<193>s (`the twice-born' ç
ones) (may be of k<218>attriyas) whereas others have relegated them ç
to the ·<220>dra caste.
Some works speak of three sub-castes among the k<193>yasthas: k<193>r<193>vara, ç
k<193>ru<218>a and kir<193>ta. These divisions were perhaps made by ç
the differences in professions and way of life.
@NT = k<193>ya·uddhi
@N1 = (`purification of the body')
Purification of the body is a primary requisite in all s<193>dhanas ç
or spiritual practices. The most common method of achieving it is ç
through sn<193>na or bathing.
Several types of sn<193>nas are described in the holy books of Hinduism.
See <MS>SN°NA<D> for more details.
@NT = k<193>yavy<220>haj<210><193>na

[internal] structure of the body')
The Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.C.<D>) describes ç
the various siddhis or vibh<220>tis (supernatural powers) that a yogi ç
attains by sam<193>dhi (perfect concentration, superconscious experience) ç
on various objects. If he concentrates on the plexus at thenavel, ç
attaining sam<193>dhi, he gets a detailed and clear knowledge (j<210><193>na) ç
of the internal structure of the body (k<193>yavy<220>ha) (Yogas<220>tras ç
3.29).
This will help him to keep his body in a fit condition.
@NT = Ked<193>ran<193>tha
Most of the Hindu pilgrimage centres are situated in places where ç
nature's beauty automatically induces peace and joy in the hearts ç
of the devout pilgrims. Among these, the Him<193>layan centres like ç
Badar<200>n<193>tha and Ked<193>ran<193>tha (also spelt as `Ked<193>rn<193>th'), ç
stand supreme.
Ked<193>ran<193>tha is actually a very small town†almost  like  a  hamlet†and  is ç
famous because of the ancient <185>iva temple. It is one of the twelve ç
Jyotirli<209>gas (li<209>gas full of divine effulgence). The story ç
goes that it was built by the P<193><207><195>avas to atone for the ç
sin of killing their cousins and others in the Kuruk<218>etra war.
It is located in the Garhwal district of Uttaranchal, at a height ç
of 3600 metres (11,760 ft.) above the sea-level.
The li<209>ga in the garbhag<216>ha or sanctum is of an irregular ç
shape, 3.6 metres (12 ft.) in circumference at the bottom and 0.6 ç
metre (2 ft.) in height. 
In front of the sanctum there is a ma<207><195>apa (hall), a large ç
image of Nandi (bull, mount of Lord <185>iva) and also many images ç
of gods and goddesses, including those of the P<193><207><195>avas. ç
A light is always kept burning in the sanctum.
The worship is simple and there is no abhi<218>eka or bathing of the ç
li<209>ga with water.
The devotees generally offer balls of ghee and are also permitted ç
to embrace the icon.
The priests of the temple are gosains belonging to the Li<209>g<193>yata ç
sect.
@SPACE1 = 
The temple is opened on the Ak<218>ayya-t<216>t<200>y<193> day (in ç
April-May) and is closed the day after D<200>p<193>val<200> (November). ç
During the winter months, the utsavam<220>rti (processional image) ç
is taken to the place called Ukhima<219>h and the worship continued.
The temple structure is very beautiful. The roof is very high. The ç
river Mand<193>kin<200> (a tributary of Ga<209>g<193>) flows at the ç
back of the temple.
There are five temples in the nearby area. They are: Badar<200>-ked<193>ra, ç
Madhya- mahe·vara, Tu<209>gan<193>tha, Rudran<193>tha and Kalle·vara. ç
All these together are called `Pa<210>caked<193>ra'.
At the back of the main temple there is a shrine of <185>a<209>kara ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 788-820). He is said to have disappeared into a cave ç
here.
According to some legends, the first teacher of the Li<209>g<193>yata ç
or the V<200>ra·aiva sect, Ekor<193>m<193>r<193>dhya, had his Ma<219>ha ç
(monastery) here.

@NT = Kena Upani<218>ad
@SPACE = 
Like the ®·<193>v<193>sya Upani<218>ad, the firstin the series ç
of the ten Upani<218>ads considered ancient and more important, the ç
Kena Upani<218>ad (which is the second) also derives its name from ç
the very first word, `kena' (`by whom') with which it begins. Since ç
it belongs to the Talavak<193>ra Br<193>hma<207>a of the S<193>maveda, ç
it is also known as the Talavak<193>ra Upani<218>ad. The talavak<193>ras ç
were those who could sing the S<193>mans with t<193>la or keeping ç
time with regular beats of hand. (This seems to have gone out of practice ç
in later years.) 
It has four kha<207><195>as or sections, the first two being in poetry ç
and the last twoin prose. The total number of verses is 35.
The Upani<218>ad opens with a question, perhaps by an inquiring disciple, ç
whether there is any entity behind the sense-organs like the ear or ç
the organ of speech or even the mind, that impels them to work. The ç
teacher replies that there is, and that he is the eye of the eye, ç
the ear of the ear, the speech of the speech and the mind of the mind. ç
They are able to function because of his presence and power. They ç
do not know him whereas he knows them all. He is Brahman. It is almost ç
impossible to impart the knowledge concerning him to others since ç
his characteristics are beyond the comprehension of the senses and ç
the mind.
Since Brahman (as the <193>tman in us, our very Self) is the real ç
knower of all that is known through the senses and the mind and itself ç
is not an object of knowledge, one can never say that one has known ç
him nor not known him. Awareness of Brahman is felt at every moment ç
of our life. It is only the direct experience of this <193>tman that ç
gives us real strength and immortality. If one misses the grand opportunity ç
given through this human birth for getting that experience and immortality ç
through it, it is a terrible loss. This is the gist of the teaching ç
of the second section.
@SPACE1 = 
The third section teaches through an interesting story that Brahman ç
is supreme and that even the gods in heaven, like Indra and Agni, ç
could win their battles against the asuras or demons only because ç
of the power imparted to them by him. They were made to learn this ç
bitter lesson after being humiliated by Brahman disguised as a yak<218>a, ç
a demigod, far inferior to them!
The fourth section is a continuation of the teaching of the third. ç
It is the goddess Um<193> Haimavat<200> that is teaching Indra, the ç
king of the gods. Brahman who appeared before Indra just for a moment ç
like lightning is also the <193>tman, the Self in every one of us. ç
One has to meditate upon him as `tadvana,' `the one who is highly ç
desirable'. This is understandable since `he' is really `me'. One ç
who realises him will therefore be liked by all beings.
The Upani<218>ad ends with the declaration that tapas (austerity), ç
dama (self-control) and karma (works and duties ordained by the scriptures) ç
are the means of attaining Brahman. So also a study of the Vedas and ç
their subsidiary sciences and satya or truth.
And, one who realises Brahman by these means, gets rid of his sins ç
and is established in `svargaloka' (the world of Brahman).

@N1 = (`hair-style)
@SPACE = 
Dressing up the hair, especially by tying it into different shapes, ç
was a well-developed art in ancient and medieval India. It was but ç
natural that this got reflected in the images of gods and goddesses ç
also.
Various such styles have been noticed and mentioned in the works on ç
icono- graphy. Sometimes, the hair itself is shaped as a crown and ç
is called `ja<219><193>muku<219>a'. Other styles are: k<193>kapak<218>a ç
(side-locks shown in the images of juvenile gods like B<193>lak<216><218><207>a); ç
alaka (curled hair); ekave<207><200> (single plait); dome-like or ç
oval shaped bun (as in the images of Rukmin<200> or God<193>dev<200>) ç
and so on.
These may be decorated with flowers or bedecked with jewels.
Fierce deities may be shown with decorations of coiled serpents (n<193>ga-bandha).

This is one of the sa<221>sk<193>ras or sacraments one had to undergo ç
in the ancient days.
It has also been called `god<193>na' (go=hair).
It is generally performed on the completion of 16 years or before ç
marriage.
It consists in shaving the head and also the hair on other parts of ç
the body such as the chin and the arm-pits.
This sa<221>sk<193>ra gradually went out of vogue.

@N1 = (`hair-shaving ceremony')
Great kings and emperors used to perform the R<193>jas<220>ya sacrifice. ç
As one of the vows, they were expected not to cut the hair on the ç
head or shave the beard for one year, after the Da·apeya rite which ç
was a part of the bigger sacrifice. The ceremonial shaving of the ç
hair after one year was known as `ke·avapan<200>ya'. The procedure ç
was very similar to the one described in the Atir<193>tra sacrifice. ç
Recitation of certain verses taken from the <184>gveda was a part ç
of this ritual.

Hindu astronomical works recognise nine planets and their influence, ç
not only on the human beings, but also on the affairs of the world.
S<220>rya (sun), Soma or Candra (moon), Ma<209>gala or Kuja or A<209>g<193>raka ç
(Mars), Budha  (Mercury),  Guru  or  B<216>haspati (Jupiter), <185>ukra ç
(Venus) and <185>ani (Saturn) are the seven planets, the guardian ç
deities of the seven days of the week. To these seven are added two ç
more planets: R<193>hu and Ketu. They are actually the two ascending ç
and descending nodes of the moon.
As per the accounts in the pur<193><207>as, R<193>hu, the son of Si<221>hik<193> ç
and Ka·yapa, was a demon. At the time of distribution of am<216>ta ç
or nectar to the gods by Vi<218><207>u as Mohin<200> (the enchantress), ç
he had surreptitiously entered into the line of the gods. As soon ç
as Vi<218><207>u discovered it, he cut off R<193>hu's head by his ç
Sudar·ana discus. Since then the head became known as `R<193>hu' and ç
the body as `Ketu'.
