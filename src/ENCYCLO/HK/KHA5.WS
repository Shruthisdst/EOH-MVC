As per this version Ketu is only the body of R<193>hu. He is, therefore, ç
often shown like a serpent's tail, whereas R<193>hu is depicted only ç
as a head.
In iconographical works Ketu has been depicted in several ways:
1)<+>He is shown as a dark and ugly person, bedecked with ornaments, ç
with two arms, riding on a vulture.
2)<+>In another account, he is pictured as riding in a chariot dawn ç
by pigeons, holding a gad<193> (mace) in one hand, with the other ç
showing varadamudr<193> (bestowal of boons).
As a planet, he is malefic in influence.
Sometimes several forms of Ketu (like Dhruvaketu, Chalaketu and Dh<220>maketu) ç
are also depicted.

Sword is a very ancient weapon of duel and war. In Hindu iconography, ç
various types of swords have been shown in the hands of the deities.
Three types of swords are more well- known: karav<200>rapatra (scimitar), ç
·<220>l<193>gra (spear-pointed) and Ma<207><195>al<193>gra (round-edged).

or chapters.
The first pa<219>ala deals with sam<193>vartana (returning from the ç
house of the guru after education) and with viv<193>ha or the marriage ç
ceremonies in great detail.
The second pa<219>ala describes the following ceremonies: Dar·a and ç
P<220>r<207>am<193>sa sacrifices;   the   pu<221>savana   and   the ç
s<200>mantonnayana ceremonies for a pregnant woman; (See under the ç

@NT = Khajur<193>ho
India is a land of temples. The Candella dynasty which ruled over ç
Jejaka-bhukti†the present day Bundelkhand of Madhya Pradesh†from the ç
9th to the 14th centuries, has left a large number of beautiful temples ç
built around <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1000 which are situated near Khajur<193>ho, ç
a village close to Chatarpur, about 45 kms. (28 miles) from it. These ç
temples belong not only to the Hindu cults of <185>aivism and Vai<218><207>avism ç
but also to Jainism.
The Hindu temples are in two rows. The largest and the best of these ç
is the Kandariya Mah<193>deva temple of Lord <185>iva. It is built ç
on a platform which is 8.6 metres (28.5 ft.) above the ground level. ç
The temple itself is 32.7 metres (109 ft.) long and 18 metres (60 ç
ft.) wide. The height of the gopuram is 35 metres (116 ft.) above ç
the ground level. An important characteristic of this temple is a ç
duplication of the vim<193>nas from the flat roof of the mukhama<207><219>apa ç
(entrance) on all sides until the central and real roof of the main ç
shrine is reached. Each succeeding vim<193>na is bigger than the preceding ç
one. The final vim<193>na is akin to that of the Li<209>gar<193>ja ç
temple of Bhubane·var in Orissa.
The Vi<218><207>u temple is 25<|>1/2 metres (85ft.) by 13 metres (44 ç
ft.). Based on the pa<210>c<193>yatana principle, it has five shrines. ç
The image of Vi<218><207>u with four arms is very beautiful.
Generally, all the temples have one entrance, gradually leading to ç
ardha-ma<207><219>apa, main ma<207><219>apa (or hall), antar<193>la ç
and then the garbhag<216>ha (sanctum). There is also a passage round ç
the main sanctum for pradak<218>i<207><193> or circumambulation.
The Kandariya Mah<193>deva or the <185>iva temple has a very large ç
number of erotic sculptures on the outside, in various postures, which ç
is rather intriguing.
There are also six Jain temples usually 18 metres (60 ft.) by 9 metres ç
(30ft.). They are simpler in structure though beautiful.

<185>a<209>kara  (<MS>A. D.<D> 788-820)  refuted several schools of ç
philosophy in his writings, especially the bh<193><218>ya on the Brahma-s<220>tras. ç
This naturally led to the defenceof those schools by their protagonists, ç
which again was contended by the followers of <185>a<209>kara, thereby ç
giving a fillip to the growth of polemical literature in Advaita Ved<193>nta. ç
One such work, a very important one at that, is the Kha<207><195>ana-kha<207><195>a-kh<193>dya ç
of <185>r<200>har<218>a (12th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>).
This work is mainly aimed at establishing the pure self-luminous consciousness ç

the pram<193><207>as (means of valid cognition) and the prameyas (the ç
objects of valid experience).
It attempts to prove that all empirical experiences and their objects ç
are only conventional relative truths and not real in the ultimate ç
sense.
<185>r<200>har<218>a has successfully utilised the principle of kha<207><195>ana ç

Ideas  can  revolutionise  a  whole society. But, ideas can be expressed ç
only through the spoken word or the written word. Whereas the former ç
can evaporate quickly, the latter can be permanently recorded. This, ç
again, needs a script.
Out of the several ancient scripts that have come to light through ç
archaeological or numismatical discoveries, the Kharo<218><219>h<200> ç
is also one. Considered as a Sanskrit word, it means `the lips (= ç
o<218><219>ha) of an ass (= khara)'. It is said that uncivilised and ç
uncultured people used to use this script in Turkistan, Tibet and ç
Iran. Others opine that the Aramaic word `kharottha' became `Kharo<218><219>h<200>' ç
in Sanskrit.
Writings in this script have been discovered on the edicts etched ç
on stone, metal plates, wood, hides as also on coins.
Rock inscriptions of A·oka discovered in Shabazgashi in the Peshawar ç
district of Pakistan, in Manshera (Hazara district in Pakistan) as ç
also the Indo-Sythian and Indo-Greek coins contain this script. It ç
might have been existent during the period 300 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> to <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
500 in India and disappeared later on. It was common among the Bactrians, ç
H<220><207>as and Ku·<193>nas.
It was generally written from the right to the left, though writing ç
it the other way was not uncommon.

material which does not form a part of the original. The word seems ç
to have become common only by the time of the sm<216>tis and s<220>tras ç

@NT = khy<193>ti
@N1 = (`knowledge,' `perception')
@SPACE = 
@SPACE = 
Though the word khy<193>ti literally means knowledge, it is often ç
used as a technical term indicating a theory that purports to explain ç
erroneous perception or illusion. Such a perception, though a fact ç
of experience, defies all attempts at explaining it. When the snake ç
is seen in a rope in insufficient light, or silver in nacre in moonlight, ç
it is difficult to say how exactly it happens.
The various schools of Indian philo-sophy have dealt with this problem ç
and have given different explanations of it. These explanations naturally ç
vary according to their epistemological and metaphysical views. Each ç
school has also tried to defend its position and refute the theories ç
of others.
The main points of controversy are concerned with the nature of the ç
illusory object and how it is caused.
The seven such khy<193>tis or theories will now be dealt with in the ç
alphabetical order:
1.<+>Akhy<193>ti (`non-apprehension'): This is the theory propounded ç
by the M<200>m<193><221>s<193> school of Prabh<193>kara. `Viveka-akhy<193>ti-v<193>da' ç
is another name for the same. According to this view, it is the akhy<193>ti ç
or non-apprehension of the difference between the memory-image of ç
silver and nacre the percept, that is responsible for the illusion ç
of silver in the nacre.
2.<+>Anirvacan<200>yakhy<193>ti (`apprehension of the indefinable'): ç
According to this theory advocated by the Advaita Ved<193>nta, the ç
illusory object like silver is an instantaneous and apparent creation ç
of aj<210><193>naor ignorance associated with the substratum like ç
nacre. Since the silver is perceived, it is not asat or unreal like ç
the son of the barren woman. Since it is sublated by the later, correct, ç
perception of nacre, it is not sat or real either. Nor can it be both ç
sat and asat simultaneously whichis contradictory. Hence it should ç
be described as anirvacan<200>ya, indefinable. The theory itself which ç
holds the illusory object as anirvacan<200>ya, is known as anirvacan<200>ya-khy<193>ti.
3. Anyath<193>khy<193>ti (`misapprehension'): This theory also called ç
`vipar<200>takhy<193>ti,' is put forward by the Ny<193>ya school, ç
the school of Indian logic. Nacre is apprehended as anyath<193>, as ç
something else. This misapprehension is caused by defective eyesight ç
or insufficient light. The reflection of the nacre in moonlight due ç
to its similarity to silver, brings on the memories of silver perceived ç
earlier. The silver of memory, of a past experience, is superimposed ç
on the nacre, or the present experience. Though both objects are real, ç
the mistake consists in superimposing one upon the other, forgetting ç
the time and place factors.
4.<+>Asat-khy<193>ti (`apprehension of the non-existent'): The nihilistic ç
school of Buddhism, called the M<193>dhyamika school, propounds the ç
theory that nothing really exists. In illusory perception, an asat ç
or a non-existent like silver is apprehended as existent. Hence the ç
name `asat-khy<193>ti', apprehending what does not really exist. Really ç
speaking, even the nacre is unreal or non-existent. Hence both†the ç
object of illusion and its substratum†are non- existent!
@SPACE1 = 
5.<+>°tma-khy<193>ti (`apprehension of thesubjective cognition'): ç
Asagainstthe nihilism  of  the  M<193>dhyamika  school, subjective ç
idealism of the Yog<193>c<193>ra school of Buddhism affirms the existence ç
of internal ideas but denies external objects. Externalization of ç
the internal cognitions is the real mistake in all perceptions whether ç
`normal' or `illusory'. The silver as well as nacre is an internal ç
idea only. This theory of illusion is known as <193>tma-khy<193>ti.
6.<+>Sadasat-khy<193>ti (`apprehension of the real-unreal'): This ç
theory is propounded by the S<193><209>khya school of Kapila. In the ç
illusory perception `This is silver', the cognition of `this' is real ç
since the object nacre is present to the organ of vision. But, the ç
cognition of `silver' is unreal since it is not present to the organ ç
of vision. Hence it is a case of apprehending the sad-asat, or real-unreal.
7. Sat-khy<193>ti (`apprehension of the real'): What is perceived ç
as real, must have its basis in a real object. If silver is perceived ç
in the nacre, it must be present there, however small may be the quantity. ç
This is possible since the funda-mental components of both nacre and ç
silver (viz., the five elements of earth, water and so on) are the ç
same. The perception is false only in the sense that the silver does ç
not serve any practical purpose. This is the view of the Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita ç
school of Ved<193>nta propagated by R<193>m<193>nuja, called sat-ky<193>ti.

Of the several castes assigned to the category of ·<220>dras or even ç
to that of the ca<207><195><193>las, the kir<193>tas are also one ç
group. If Manu (Manusm<216>ti 10.43 & 44) considers them as originally ç
k<218>attriyas reduced to the status of ·<220>dras due to the non- ç
performance of their religious duties, the Vedavy<193>sasm<216>ti ç
(1.10 & 11) considers them as a subdivision of ·<220>dras. Others ç
assign them to the group of mlecchas (untouchable foreigners)!

@NT = k<200>rtana
@N1 = (`praising')
The bhakti-movements of the middle ages, pioneered and developed by ç
a galaxy of poet-mystics and mystical philosophers, made religion ç
very easy of access to the masses. They laid great stress on n<193>majapa ç
(repetition of the divine name or mantra) and k<200>rtana (singing ç
the names and glories of God) and taught that these two were enough ç
to wash off one's sins and obtain the grace of God.
K<200>rtana is singing the names of the Divine or devotional songs, ç
generally to the accompaniment of musical instruments. Group-singing ç
is sometimes called `sa<209>k<200>rtana'.
There may also be dancing to the tune and rhythm of the songs.
K<200>rtana is also the name of a work by the great mystic and religious ç
teacher of Assam, <185>a<209>kara Deva (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1486-1568), ç

The use of such prabh<193>-val<200>s dates back to the second century ç

a leonine figure with protruding eyes, open mouth and fierce fangs. ç

or the `face of glory'.
As per the story in the Padmapur<193><207>a, J<193>landhara, a fierce ç
demon, fell in love with P<193>rvat<200> and sent R<193>hu (See <MS>R°HU<D>.) ç
to <185>iva demanding that he part with her. Enraged by this indecent ç
demand, <185>iva created a terrible being from his hair and commanded ç
it to swallow R<193>hu. When R<193>hu pleaded for mercy, his life ç
was saved but the being created wanted something else to appease his ç
hunger. <185>iva asked him to devour his own body! Since the latter ç
could devour his whole body except his own head, <185>iva being pleased ç

One of the festivals dear to Mother Lak<218>m<200> and observed mostly ç
in Bengal is the Koj<193>gar<200> P<220>r<207>im<193>, the full-moon ç
day in the month of °·vayuja or °·vina. It is also called, `<185>aratp<220>r<207>im<193>' ç
since it comes in the <185>arad<216>tu or autumn.
On this day Lak<218>m<200>, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, ç
is believed to come late in the night to every house and bless all ç
those who are awake to receive her, uttering the words, `ko j<193>grati?' ç
(`who is awake?'). Hence the adjective `koj<193>gar<200>'.

@SPACE1 = 
Kolh<193>pur†formerly known as `Karav<200>ra'†was the capital of the ç
Kolh<193>pur State. Now it is a part of the State of Maharashtra. ç
It is situated 240 kms. (150 miles) south of Pune, on the bank of ç
the river Pa<210>caga<209>g<193>.
@SPACE1 = 
It is one of the <185>aktip<200><219>has or Siddhap<200><219>has with ç
Mah<193>lak<218>m<200> as the chief presiding deity. This Mah<193>lak<218>m<200> ç
is one of the three aspects of the Dev<200>, described in the Dev<200>m<193>h<193>tmya ç
or Durg<193>sapta·at<200>.
The site of this city seems to be an ancient one since many Buddhist ç
relics have been found in the archaeological excavations.
Out of the numerous temples, the shrines of Mah<193>lak<218>m<200> ç
(also known as Amb<193>b<193><200>), Vi<219>hob<193>, Temblai, Mah<193>k<193>l<200>, ç
Pratya<209>giras  and  Yellamma  are more famous.
Though the image of Mah<193>lak<218>m<200> is old, the present temple ç
was perhaps built during the first quarter of the 18th century.
The shrine is like a cross, on plan and is surrounded by a spacious ç
courtyard. The deity is facing west and hence the western gateway ç
is the mah<193>dv<193>ra or the main entrance. There is a huge open ç
hall called `Garu<195>a-ma<207><219>apa' constructed of wood, with ç
square pillars and foliated arches. This has an image of Garu<195>a ç
facing the goddess.
The image of the goddess Mah<193>lak<218>m<200> has been carved out ç
of black stone and is about 91 cms. (36 inches) in height. It is very ç
beautiful. It has four arms holding gad<193> (mace), M<193>tuli<209>ga ç
(a big fruit, similar to lemon in appearance), khe<219>aka (shield) ç
and p<193>nap<193>tra (bowl). On the crown of the Dev<200>, are a ç
<185>ivali<209>ga and a cobra-hood. Standing behind the Dev<200> is ç
the lion, her v<193>hana or carrier.
There is also a sculptured <185>r<200>cakra or <185>r<200>yantra on ç
one of the walls of the temple in the ma<207><195>apa area.
The Navar<193>tri festival, especially the °·vina-·ukla-pa<210>cam<200> ç
(the fifth day in the bright half of the month °·vayuja or °·vina, ç
usually in September or October) is celebrated on a grand scale. The ç
utsava- m<220>rti (processional image) is ceremonially carried in ç
a procession through the city. On the p<220>r<207>im<193> or full-moon ç
day of the same month, the temple door is decorated with lighted lamps.
There is a big bell also in the temple, which seems to have been obtained ç
from the Portuguese.
Minor shrines housing Mah<193>k<193>l<200> and Mah<193>sarasvat<200> ç
are also situated in the north and the south, in the same campus.
@NT = Koll<220>ru
Situated on the bank of the small river Saupar<207>ik<193> and at ç
the foot of the Western Ghats, this small town is drawing very big ç
crowds throughout the year, because of its famous temple of the goddess ç
M<220>k<193>mbik<193>. It is located at a distance of 147 kms. (90 ç
miles) from Mangalore on the west coast in Karnataka State.
According to the local legends, it was originally known as Mah<193>ra<207>yapura. ç
Since a famous sage, Kola Mahar<218>i, practised austerities here ç
to please the Divine Mother, it was renamed Kol<193>pura. This name ç
was gradually transformed into Koll<220>ru in the local language.
A fierce demon, Ka<221>ha or M<220>k<193>sura by name, who had been ç
terrorising the world, was killed by the Dev<200> (the Divine Mother) ç
at this place. She decided to stay back here at the request of the ç
sage, manifesting herself in the form of an udbhavali<209>ga (self ç
manifested <185>ivali<209>ga). It is this li<209>ga in the sanctum ç
of the temple that is being worshipped even now. Its speciality is ç
that it is divided into two unequal parts by a golden line, the larger ç
part on the left representing the three aspects of the Dev<200> (Mah<193>k<193>l<200>, ç
Mah<193>lak<218>m<200> and Mah<193>sarasvat<200>) and the smaller ç
part, the Hindu Trinity (<185>iva, Vi<218><207>u and Brahm<193>).
<185>a<209>kara (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 788-820) is said to have worshipped ç
the goddess here. The beautiful metallic image of the deity was got ç
made by him as per the vision he had had and installed.
It is in the seated posture with four hands. Two hands are holding ç
the ·a<209>kha (conch) and the cakra (discus). The other two are exhibiting ç
the abhaya (protection) and varada (boon-giving) mudr<193>s (hand-poses).
The entire process of rituals also was prescribed by <185>a<209>kara.
The room near the sanctum of the Dev<200> where he had had her vision, ç
has been preserved and called <185>a<209>kara- si<221>h<193>sana.
The temple complex contains several subsidiary shrines dedicated to ç
V<200>rabhadra (one of the terrific aspects of <185>iva), Subrahma<207>ya, ç
P<193>rthe·vara (<185>iva), Pa<210>camukha-Ga<207>apati (with five ç
faces), Hanum<193>n, Mah<193>vi<218><207>u and Gop<193>lak<216><218><207>a.
Worship to the main deity is performed three times per day: 5 <MS>A.M.<D>; ç
11 <MS>A.M.<D> and 7 <MS>P.M.<D>
The western gate of the temple, through which <185>a<209>kara is said ç
to have entered, is normally kept closed and opened only on special ç
occasions.

Ko<207><193>rka (also spelt as Kon<193>rak), is about 30 kms. (20 ç
miles) to the north-east of the well-known place of pilgrimage Pur<200> ç
or Jagann<193>thapur<200>, in the Orissa State on the east coast. ç
It is famous for the wonderful temple of S<220>rya (Sun-god), now ç
in ruins. It has been built resembling a ratha or a chariot a replica ç
of the ratha in which S<220>rya travels in the sky all-round the earth. ç
Legends attribute its entire concept and design to the vision of an ç
expert sculptor Vi<218><207>u-mah<193>r<193><207>a.
The whole temple is in the n<193>gara style, peculiar to Kali<209>gade·a ç
or the present-day Orissa.
The temple was built by the king Narasi<221>hadeva of the Ga<209>ga ç
dynasty in the 13th century <MS>A.<|>D<D>. He is said to have ruled ç
from <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1238 to 1264.
As per one account, twelve thousand workers are said to have toiled ç
for twelve long years to build this temple.
This temple, conceived as the gigantic solar chariot has twelve pairs ç
of exquisitely carved wheels, each 3 metres (10 ft.) in diameter. ç
It is drawn by seven steeds.
The sanctum, now, has no roof northe image. The n<193><219>mandir ç
(the n<216>tta-ma<207><195>apa or dance-hall) also has no roof.
The jagmohan (ardhama<207><195>apa) which is almost intact measures ç
34.15 metres (114ft.) square and the total height of the ·ikhara ç
is 38.4 metres (128 ft.).
The whole temple is on a raised platform.
The sanctum has 3 superb images of the Sun-god in the three cardinal ç
niches, shown as projecting subsidiary shrines. The walls of the jagmohan ç
are adorned with geometric motifs, people, mythical animals and erotic ç
scenes.
There is an iron beam below the roof of the jagmohan, 6 metres (20 ç
ft.) long and 24 cms. (about 10 inches) in thickness. Its weight had ç
been estimated to be 61tonnes!
Symbolically speaking, the 24 wheels represent the 24 pak<218>as or ç
fortnights in a year. The seven horses stand for the seven colours ç
in the sunlight, generally indicated by the word <MS>VIBGYOR.

@NT = Kosala
@SPACE1 = 
According to the historians, there were two ancient kingdoms by this ç
name. The first was the kingdom ruled over by Da·aratha with its capital ç
at Ayodhy<193> on the bank of the river Saray<220>. The second was ç
the kingdom of Bh<193>numanta whose daughter Kausaly<193> had been ç
married to Da·aratha as his first wife and chief queen.
In later literature, the former has been known as Uttara-Kosala and ç
the latter as Dak<218>i<207>a-Kosala.
When R<193>ma abdicated his kingdom, he gave the former to Lava and ç
the latter to Ku·a (R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, Uttarak<193><207><195>a, ç
ch. 107). Lava moved the capital to <185>r<193>vasti and Ku·a established ç
a new city named after him, as Ku·<193>vat<200>. Ayodhy<193> was abandoned ç
as the capital.
The Uttara Kosala corresponds roughly to the modern Oudh and the boundaries ç
probably extended up to the hills of Nepal. The ancient Ayodhy<193> ç
has been identified with the twin towns of Ayodhy<193> and Fyzabad ç
in Uttar Pradesh.
The Dak<218>i<207>a Kosala perhaps extended up to the region of Raipur, ç
Sambal- pur and Bilaspur in Madhya Pradesh.
Sometimes, the word Kosala has beenused to indicate a people (vide ç

For many centuries, the Hindus have believed that the stars and planets ç
have a bearing on our life here and now. When they are not well-disposed, ç
they can cause adverse effects. However, these adverse effects can ç
definitely be minimised†if not eliminated†by the performance of some ç
rites called `·<193>ntis'.
Two such rites are the Lak<218>ahoma and the Ko<219>ihoma. They are ç
generally performed by a king so that he and his kingdom are free ç
from all calamities.
The Ko<219>ihoma is to be done on anauspicious tithi (lunar day) ç
in the ·uklapak<218>a (bright fortnight), associated with certain ç
nak<218>atras like Rohi<207><200>, Pu<218>ya and so on.

@NT = kramamukti
@N1 = (`gradual release or<R>ç
liberation')
@SPACE = 
AllsystemsofHinduphilosophy, especially the Ved<193>nta, posit ç
mok<218>a or liberation from transmigratory existence as the final ç
goal of life.
This mok<218>a or mukti is of two types: sadyomukti (instant release) ç
and kramamukti (gradual release).
When the aspirant, following the pathof j<210><193>na or knowledge, ç
realises the <193>tman (his Self), he attains sadyomukti or liberation ç
here and now. This is also called `j<200>vanmukti' or liberation even ç
while living in this body. After the pr<193>rabdha-karma is exhausted ç
and the body falls, he gets final liberation, called `videhamukti'.
However, if the s<193>dhaka combines the performance of actions ordained ç
by the scriptures with devatop<193>san<193> or meditation on gods ç
like Indra, he will go, after death to the Brahmaloka (or Satyaloka), ç
the world of Brahm<193>, by the path of devay<193>na (the path of ç
gods, also called arcir<193>dim<193>rga or the path of light), live ç
there till the dissolution of that world and then will get merged ç
in the Supreme Brahman. This is called `kramamukti' or `gradual liberation'.

Literally the word `kr<193>nta' means `stepped upon or occupied'. ç
In a more general way, it means a division. Some of the t<193>ntrik ç
works like the Mah<193>-siddhas<193>ra Tantra have divided Bh<193>rata-var<218>a ç
(greater India) into three kr<193>nt<193>s or units, viz., vi<218><207>ukr<193>nt<193>, ç
rathakr<193>nt<193> and a·vakr<193>nt<193>. The land to the east of ç
the Vindhya hills, extending upto J<193>va is vi<218><207>ukr<193>nt<193>. ç
The country north of the Vindhyas including Mah<193>c<200>n<193>, ç
is ratha-kr<193>nt<193>. The rest of the country westward is a·vakr<193>nt<193>.
@SPACE1 = 
The three words are also used as adjectives to the earth in the M<216>ttik<193>s<220>kta ç
of the Mah<193>n<193>r<193>ya<207>a Upani<218>ad (1.37). Before ç
performing a Vedic sacrifice, the place has to be sanctified by running ç
a horse-drawn chariot over the ground. Thus the earth becomes `kr<193>nt<193>' ç
or sanctified by the a·vas (horses) and the ratha (chariot). It is ç
vi<218><207>ukr<193>nt<193> since it was stepped upon by the foot ç
of Vi<218><207>u in his V<193>mana-Trivikrama incarnation. Since this ç
earth, through the sacrifice performed there, gives `vasu' or wealth ç
in course of time it can also be called `Vasundhar<193>' (one who ç
bears wealth).
