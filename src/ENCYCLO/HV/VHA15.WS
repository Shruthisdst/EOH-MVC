According to this definition, the vr<193>tyas were dvijas by birth ç
but had neglected or ignored the sacrament of upanayana. They could ç
however be re- absorbed into the society by the performance of Vr<193>tyastoma ç
sacrifice as expiation.
They probably led a nomadic life not practising either agriculture ç
or commerce. They might have lived to the west of the Sarasvat<200> ç
river.
The Pa<210>cavi<221>·a Br<193>hma<207>a (17.1) gives some interesting ç
details about their dress and way of life. Their leader (g<216>hapati) ç
wore a turban (u<218><207><200><218>a), carried a whip (pratoda) and ç
a kind of bow (jy<193>hro<195>a). He moved in a wagon (vipatha) covered ç
with planks. He dressed himself well. His subordinates wore red-bordered ç
garments.
After they were readmitted into the main °ryan fold, they had to surrender ç
all these things and adopt the way of life prescribed for the dvijas ç
(the twice-born classes, the first three castes).
It is interesting to note that the Atharvaveda (15.1.1) uses the ç
word vr<193>tya for God.

This is a special kind of sacrifice to be performed by the vr<193>tyas ç
(See <MS>VR°TYAS<D>.) to be readmitted into the comity of the dvijas ç
(members of the first three castes).
It consists of 4 ek<193>has or Soma sacrifices, each spread over one ç
day only. In each of the ek<193>has, the <186>o<195>a·astoma (certain ç
<184>gvedic verses increased up to 16while chanting) (See <MS>STOMA<D> ç
also.) is repeated (vide T<193><207><195>yamah<193>br<193>hma<207>a ç
17.1-4).
The details of the sacrifice are quite complicated.

@N1 = (`sm<216>tis [with the prefix] ``v<216>ddha''<|>')
Renowned authors of dharma·<193>stra literature often quote verses ç
from or refer to other authorities. Some of these have prefixes like ç
B<216>hat, Laghu or V<216>ddha, followed by famous names whose works ç
are already well-known. For instance there is a H<193>r<200>tasm<216>ti. ç
There are also two works called Laghu-H<193>r<200>ta and V<216>ddha-H<193>r<200>ta. ç
These are available either in fragments or found quoted in other works.

@NT = V<216>nd<193>ban
V<216>nd<193>ban (also spelt as V<216>nd<193>van, B<216>nd<193>van ç
and B<216>nd<193>ban) is one of the famous places of pilgrimage closely ç
associ-ated with the childhood days of Lord K<216><218><207>a. It ç
is at a distance of 10 kms. (7miles) from the city of Mathur<193> ç
(See <MS>MATHUR°<D>.) in Uttar Pradesh.
Though a small town on the bank of the Yamun<193> river, it is dotted ç
with innumerable temples, gh<193><219>s (places on the river bank ç
provided with steps for taking bath) and other sacred spots connected ç
with K<216><218><207>a's life.
The name V<216>nd<193>ban is derived from V<216>nd<193>, the daughter ç
of the king Ked<193>ra, who practised severe austerities here to get ç
Lord Vi<218><207>u as her husband. After succeeding in getting the ç
boon from him, she was reborn here as R<193>dh<193>, the daughter ç
of V<216><218>abh<193>nu and Kal<193>vat<200>.
The following are the more important of the temples:
K<216><218><207>agopala Mandir, Ba<207>kebih<193>ri Mandir, Sh<193><199> ç
Bih<193>r<200>j<200> Mandir, R<193>dh<193>-rama<207> Mandir, <185>r<200>ra<209>gaj<200> ç
Mandir (of Ra<209>gan<193>tha, built in the South Indian style) and ç
Gop<193>le·varan<193>tha Mandir (of <185>iva).
The famous Gokula where K<216><218><207>a spent his childhood days ç
first, is on the opposite bank of the river Yamun<193>. Of the several ç
temples, that of Gokuln<193>th is the chief one.
The Govardhana hill which is 34 kms. (21 miles) from Mathur<193> is ç
a small hillock spread over 6 to 7 kilometres (4 miles). It has an ç
ancient temple dedicated to Govardhanan<193>tha. About 5 kms. (3 miles) ç
away from this hill is the village R<193>dh<193>ku<207><195>a surrounded ç
by two big tanks known as R<193>dh<193>ku<207><195>a and K<216><218><207>aku<207><195>a.
@NT = v<216><218>otsarga
@N1 = (`letting loose a bull')
The Hindu scriptures prescribe a number of religious rites and observances ç
to be performed for the benefit of the soul of a dead person, especially ç
during the first two weeks after his death. One such is the v<216><218>otsarga ç
or the letting loose of a bull on the eleventh day along with a heifer.
Both the animals have to be bathed, adorned and branded with a discus ç
and a trident. After uttering a prescribed mantra, both of them are ç
driven away in the southern direction, the direction of Yama, the ç
god of death.
This act is supposed to free the dead person from the preta or the ç
disembodied state, enabling him to cross the ocean of mortality.
The ceremony is completed by a feast to eleven br<193>hma<207>as, ç
called mah<193>p<193>tras here.
@SPACE =

@N1 = (`the teaching [given to] V<216>tra [by the sage Sanaka]')
@SPACE = 
This is one of the minor G<200>t<193>s that appears in the Mah<193>bh<193>rata ç
(<185><193>ntiparva 279 and 280; 104 ·lokas).
V<216>tra, the king of the d<193>navas or asuras (demons) asked his ç
guru <185>ukr<193>-c<193>rya about the secret of karma and its resultant ç
births. When <185>ukr<193>c<193>rya was about to answer, Sanatkum<193>ra, ç
the great sage arrived there. He was requested to answer the questions.
The discourse of Sanatkum<193>ra is quite long and complicated. Only ç
the gist may be given here:
Mah<193>vi<218><207>u is the Supreme Lord who creates, sustains and ç
then dissolves the whole creation. All the worlds and all the beings ç
are established in him only.
The j<200>vas or the embodied souls pass through the rounds of births ç
and deaths because of their v<193>san<193>s (strong mental impressions)  brought  about  by  their ç
karmas or actions, good or bad.
After experiencing the result of their karmas in higher worlds like ç
heaven or lower worlds like hell, they return to the world of men. ç
If they perform spiritual s<193>dhanas and realise their true nature ç
as <193>tman, they will attain the supreme world of Vi<218><207>u.
V<216>tra realised it by the grace of Mah<193>vi<218><207>u and got ç
liberation.
@NT = V<216>tr<193>sura
The story of V<216>tra or V<216>tr<193>sura is as old as the <184>gveda ç
(vide 1.32.5). There, V<216>tra is pictured as the demon of drought ç
preventing rain-bearing clouds from giving rain. Indra `kills' him ç
with his vajra or vajr<193>yudha (thunderbolt) and releases the water.
In the pur<193><207>as he is described as the son of Tva<218><219><216>, ç
created out of sacrificial fire, to destroy Indra who had earlier ç
killed Vi·var<220>pa, the first son of Tva<218><219><216>. A mistake ç
in the chanting of the Vedic mantra during the pouring of oblations ç
resulted in V<216>tr<193>sura becoming vulnerable to Indra's weapon. ç
Though V<216>tr<193>sura conquered Indra first he was later killed ç
by the latter.
V<216>tr<193>sura was a king, Citraketu by name, in his previous birth. ç
He was a great devotee of Vi<218><207>u (vide Bh<193>gavata 6.11).

@NT = v<216>tti
This word, though it appears to be very simple, has as many as fourteen ç
meanings or senses! Only a few of them can be given here.
It means a vocation by which a person earns his livelihood.
In Sanskrit literature, it stands for a simple commentary on a well-known ç
treatise, especially in the form of s<220>tras.
In the Yogas<220>tras (1.2,<|>4,<|>5,<|>10) it stands for the modifications ç
of the mind.
In drama literature, it signifies a sentiment.
It may also mean behaviour in general.
@NT = V<216>ttik<193>ra
See <MS>BODH°YANA<D>.
@NT = vyabhic<193>ra
@N1 = (`transgression')
In general it means an evil act and in particular, adultery. The dharma·<193>stras ç
prescribe various kinds of punishment like amputation or even death.
In logic it means a fallacy. If an effect is denied even though the ç
cause exists, or, if an effect is accepted to exist in spite of the ç
fact that the cause does not, it becomes the fallacy of vyabhic<193>ra.
@NT = vy<193>dhi
@N1 = (`disease')
°yurveda or the science of health and longevity, categorises vy<193>dhi ç
or roga(disease) into four groups: <193>gantuka (coming from external ç
sources or accidents); ·<193>r<200>ra (arising in the body due to ç
the disturbance of the balance of the three humours viz., kapha, v<193>ta ç
and pitta); m<193>nasa (of the mind, due to jealousy, anger, lust ç
and so on); sv<193>bh<193>vika (natural due to hunger, thirst, oldage, ç
sleep etc.).
These diseases may be caused by faulty living as also by the karma ç
of the previous lives.

ridiculous.
An interesting stanza sometimes quoted by commentators runs as follows: ç

@NT = vy<193>kara<207>a
@N1-1 = (`[a science] that makes<R>ç
[language] more clear,' `grammar')
Vy<193>kara<207>a or grammar is one of the six Ved<193><209>gas or ç
subsidiaries of the Veda. It is described as the face or the mouth ç
of the Vedapuru<218>a, the Veda personified as the cosmic being.
Some scholars feel that there is a clear reference to vy<193>kara<207>a ç
in the <184>gvedic mantra 4.58.6 which compares it to a v<216><218>abha ç
or a bull. N<193>ma (noun), <193>khy<193>ta (verb), upasarga (prefix) ç
and so on, are its various limbs. However others do not agree with ç
this view.
Another mantra of the <184>gveda (10.71.4) praises vy<193>kara<207>a ç
since it helps one to understand the purport of the Vedas correctly.
The Gopatha Br<193>hma<207>a (1.24) of theAtharvaveda mentions ç
most of the technical terms commonly used in Sanskrit grammar.
Vararuci (58 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) has delineated fiveuses of grammar. They ç
are: rak<218><193> (protection of the Vedas); <220>h<193> (guessing ç
the correct meaning of the Vedic sentences, especially those concerned ç
with y<193>gas orsacrifices); <193>gama (Vedic statements supporting ç
the study of grammar); laghu (suggesting an easy way of attaining ç
ourwishes by understanding the Vedas properly); asandeha (clearing ç
the doubts of the Vedic sentences).
Which exactly is the original vy<193>kara<207>a considered the Ved<193><209>ga, ç
is difficult to say. Though an Aindra-vy<193>kara<207>a is alluded ç
to in the Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> (6.4.7.3) as a very ancient ç
work of grammar, it is not available now in any form. Among the extant ç
vy<193>kara<207>as, P<193><207>ini's A<218><219><193>dhy<193>y<200> ç
is the earliest (500<MS>B.C.<D>). However, it refers to several ç
grammarians of the earlier period. Some of them are: °pi·al<200> (6.1.92); ç
Bh<193>radv<193>ja (7.2.64); C<193>kravarma<207>a (6.1.130); G<193>lava ç
(6.3.61; 8.4.67); G<193>rgya (7.3.99); <185><193>kalya (1.1.16); <185><193>ka<219><193>yana ç
(8.3.18); Spho<219><193>yana (6.1.123).
For all practical purposes, the A<218><219><193>dhy<193>y<200> of ç
P<193><207>ini may be taken as the Ved<193><209>ga-vy<193>kara<207>a.
The A<218><219><193>dhy<193>y<200> deals with both Vedic Sanskrit ç
and classical Sanskrit. (See <MS>A<186><187>°DHY°Y®<D> for more details.)
@SPACE1 = 
This work has several commentaries. The Mah<193>bh<193><218>ya of ç
Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) is the most celebrated of them all. ç
The V<193>rttika of K<193>ty<193>yana which is incomplete, is another ç
well-known work. The K<193>·ik<193>-v<216>tti of V<193>mana and Jay<193>ditya ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 700) is a brief but complete commentary on P<193><207>ini.
Another well-known work which is extremely popular even now is the ç
Siddh<193>ntakaumud<200> of Bha<219><219>oji D<200>k<218>ita (<MS>A.D.<D> ç
1600-1650). This is a rearrangement of all the s<220>tras of P<193><207>ini ç
according to the subject matter, with his own gloss. Varadar<193>ja, ç
his disciple, prepared two more shorter versions†the Madhya-siddh<193>nta-kaumud<200> ç
and the Laghusiddh<193>ntakaumud<200>†which too are popular even ç
to this day.
In the post-P<193><207>ini period, several schools of grammar evolved, ç
based upon some important basic works. Six of them may be mentioned ç
here: the K<193>tantra school of <185>arvavarma (1st century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>); ç
the C<193>ndra-Vy<193>kara<207>a school of Candra-gomiya (5th century ç
<MS>A.<|>D.<D>); the Jainendra Vy<193>kara<207>a school of Devanandin ç
(6th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>); the <185><193>ka<219><193>yana Vy<193>kara<207>a ç
school of P<193>lyak<200>rti (9th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>); the Siddha ç
Hemacandra school or Haima Vy<193>kara<207>a school of Hemacandras<220>ri ç
(12th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>); the Sarasvat<200>-ka<207><219>h<193>-bhara<207>a ç
school of the Param<193>ra king Bhoja (11th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>).
Some of the other grammatical works of the later period are: the Sa<209>k<218>iptas<193>ra ç
of Kramad<200>·vara (12th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>); the Mugdhabodha ç
of Bopadeva (13th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>); the Supadmavy<193>kara<207>a ç
of Padma-n<193>bha (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1375) and S<193>rasvata-vy<193>kara<207>a ç
of Anubh<220>tisvar<220>pa (14th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>).
@SPACE1 = 
Mention may be made here of the treatises dealing exclusively with ç
the genders of nouns, a class of literature known as Li<209>g<193>nu·<193>sanas. ç
Of all such works, the N<193>mali<209>g<193>nu·<193>sana of Amara-si<221>ha ç
(<MS>A.<|>D. <D>500) is the best known and most widely used.<MS>
It may also be noted that some ancient grammarians like Pata<210>jali ç
(200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) and Bhart<216>hari (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 450-500) have ç
developed a spiritual philosophy out of grammar, identifying the eternal ç
aspect of sound (= nitya·abda) with the Brahman of Ved<193>nta.
The  following  are  the  subjects normally dealt with in all these ç
works of grammar:
N<193>mapada   (nouns);   sarvan<193>ma (pronouns); li<209>ga (gender); ç
vacana (number); vibhakti (declension); dh<193>tu (root-verbs); kriy<193>pada ç

The position of the king or the rulerof a country involves a heavy ç
responsibility. The life and property of its people, their religion ç
and culture, the natural resources †in fact, every aspect of the nation's ç
life† depends upon him. If he is a good and great king, the country ç
will prosper. If not, it will suffer much.
Hindu religious works list a number of vyasanas or vices of a king ç
that lead to his fall and ruin his country.
The vices in his personal life are mainly four: p<193>na (drinking); ç
ak<218>a or dy<220>ta (gambling); str<200> (sexual excesses); m<216>gay<193> ç
(hunting). Some of the other defects are: wrong policy decisions; ç
harshness of speech; excessive use of force; mismanagement of financial ç
resources; neglecting his duties and responsibilities.
Kau<219>ilya (321 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) in his monumental work, the Artha·<193>stra ç
(Chapter 8) discusses the topic of vyasana in great detail. Some of ç
the natural disasters like agni (fire), durbhik<218>a (famine) and ç
ativ<216><218><219>i (floods) have also been listed as vyasanas.
There can be vyasanas or defects in other fields of the kingdom also, ç

pur<193><207>as. However, the Vy<193>sasm<216>ti as available now ç
in print is a work of another Vy<193>sa who might have lived during ç
the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 200-500. He might have been a contemporary ç
of other writers of sm<216>tis like B<216>haspati and Y<193>j<210>avalkya.
The printed text as available now has 250 verses and deals with the ç
following topics: extent of the land where the dharmas described here ç
apply; relative authoritativeness of the <185>ruti, sm<216>ti and ç
the pur<193><207>as; mixed castes; the sixteen sa<221>sk<193>ras; ç
duties of a brahmac<193>rin; duties of a wife; nitya, naimittika and ç
k<193>mya karmas of a householder; on gifts.
Other well-known writers on the dharma·<193>stra often quote verses ç
as of Vy<193>sa. These are mostly from the Mah<193>-bh<193>rata. ç
There are also verses not found in the epic. These verses†about 200 ç
in number†deal with the topic of vyavah<193>ra or common laws. Quite ç
a few legal matters bearing on gifts of land, procedures in lawsuits ç
and division of ancestral property are dealt with in these verses. ç

According to the Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) ç
the mind generally has two states: vyutth<193>na (rising) and nirodha ç
(suppressed). The rising of the v<216>ttis (mental waves) is prompted ç
by the sa<221>sk<193>ras (past impressions) lurking in the mind.
The science of yoga advises the aspirant to suppress the rising of ç
the v<216>ttis by using the steps recommended by it. This is technically ç
called nirodha, the same as cittav<216>ttinirodha (Yogas<220>tras ç
1.2). Asnirodha or suppression is practised more and more, the nirodhasa<221>sk<193>ra ç
(impression in the mind that helps in the suppression of the v<216>ttis) ç
becomes stronger. Once this is achieved the mind becomes more and ç
more quiet and peaceful (vide Yogas<220>tras 3.9, 10).
