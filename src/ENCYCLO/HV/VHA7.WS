Because the advice was given by Vidura, it is called Viduran<200>ti. ç
This section, treated as a subsection of the Udyoga- parva is also ç
designated as Praj<193>garaparva alluding to Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra ç
being awake (= praj<193>gara) the whole night due to restlessness.
A very brief summary of the contents may now be given here:
@SPACE = 
@S10N = First Chapter (123 verses)
@SPACE1 = 
After spending a night without sleep, Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra ç
sends for Vidura who arrives immediately. Vidura first accuses the ç
blindking of entertainingevil persons† Duryodhana, Du··<193>sana, ç
Kar<207>a and <185>akuni†as his trusted lieutenants. He describes ç
the characteristics of learned men and fools. He then expatiates on ç
what ought to be done and what should be abjured, using the numbers ç
one to ten in an intelligent and interesting manner. The last part ç
of this chapter contains the advice of Prahl<193>da, the great king ç
of the demons, to kings in general, quoted by Vidura.
@SPACE = 
@S10N = Second Chapter (86 verses)
@SPACE1 = 
Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra confesses that he is upset and restless ç
and seeks Vidura's guidance. Vidura starts his discourses by saying ç
that a true friend must give advice even if not solicited. In his ç
long counsel, he stresses three things. Firstly, a king who wants ç
to rule well, must know everything about his kingdom. Secondly, he ç
should be neither miserly nor overgenerous. Thirdly, as a human being ç
he should cultivate virtues that can make him great and avoid all ç
vices. At the end he advises Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra to hand over ç
the reigns of the kingdom to Yudhi<218><219>ira, the eldest of the ç
P<193><207><195>avas since he deserved it best.
@S10N = Third Chapter (77 verses)
In this chapter Vidura illustrates by an ancient episode of Sudhanvan ç
(a br<193>hma<207>a youth), Virocana (a d<193>nava prince) and his ç
father Prahl<193>da (the king of the d<193>navas) the superiority ç
of the path of truth and justice. The rest of the chapter gives many ç
principles of ethics including things that must be done and those ç
which must be eschewed.
@S10N = Fourth Chapter (74 verses)
This chapter starts with the advice given by the great sage Datt<193>treya ç
to devas (gods) and s<193>dhyas (demigods). The sage stresses the ç
importance of speech containing truth and sweetness. After narrating ç
this, Vidura, in answer to a question by the blind king, expounds ç
the qualities that should exist in a kula or race to make it good ç
and great. It is pure character that makes it good and great. He then ç
describes the evils of anger and the importance of unity among the ç
good.
@S10N = Fifth Chapter (64 verses)
Vidura describes 17 types of persons as m<220>rkhas or foolish ones ç
and advises that none should become a m<220>rkha. He then exhorts ç
that good persons should be treated well and that the bad ones be ç
repaid in their own coin!
When Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra asks why a man's life which should ç
be of a hundred years' duration is shortened, Vidura replies thatit ç
is the six evils like arrogance, uncontrolled anger or intense selfishness ç
that shorten a person's life. On the other hand, good persons who ç
are obedient to the elders, who are devoted to God and who do not ç
harm others and who practise other virtues like truth, live long.
Other points stressed by him are: importance of protecting oneself ç
against adharma (unrighteousness); fair treatment of one's dependents; ç
qualifications of a right kind of d<220>ta or messenger; five kindsof ç
bala or strength like physical strength,economic power and power ç
of wisdom; avoiding enmity with the great and powerful persons.
@S10N = Sixth Chapter (47 verses)
In this chapter, the following topics are dealt with: treating the ç
respected elders properly; avoiding persons of evil character; protecting ç
women; how a king should select ministers who are trust- worthy; how ç
he should behave towards his subjects and the enemies.
@S10N = Seventh Chapter (85 verses)
Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra tries to counter Vidura's sane advice ç
by arguments of fatalism. Vidura replies that even the best advice ç
given by a great person like B<216>haspati will fall on deaf ears ç
if the receiver of the advice is prejudiced! He again exhorts the ç
blind king to abandon his son Duryo-dhana and save the dynasty of ç
the great Kurus.
Other pieces of advice rendered by Vidura can be summarised as follows: ç
avoiding the evil ones who try to create misunderstandings among others; ç
honouring and helping one's j<210><193>tis or close relatives even ç
if they are just ordinary persons; honouring the P<193><207><195>avas ç
by giving them their due; six factors like drinking or ignorance of ç
the presence of the enemies nearby, to be avoided; cultivation of ç
virtues like humility, heroism and forgiveness; characteristics of ç
a good friend; importance of thoughts in shaping one's character; ç
on the acquisition of wealth by right means; looking upon others as ç
one's own self; the need to abandon greed.
@S10N = Eighth Chapter (32 verses)
Vidura once again extols the greatness of dharma. He then describes ç
how <193>·<193> or desire which can never be satiated, destroys a ç
person by pointing out the inevitability of death to all living beings. ç
Since karma†good or bad†accompanies the spirit of the dead person, ç
one should strive to acquire dharma only. He concludes his discourse ç
by describing briefly the duties of the four var<207>as or castes.
It is rather tragic that Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra while conceding ç
the rightness of Vidura's advice, confesses his weakness of his attachment ç
to his son Duryodhana which makes him go off the path! He ultimately ç
resigns himself to his `di<218><219>am' or fate.
The Viduran<200>ti can be considered a valuable treatise on general ç
ethics evenas the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> is on spiritual wisdom.
The Bh<193>ratabh<193>vad<200>pa of N<200>laka<207><219>ha Caturdhara ç

work.

@NT = Vidur<193>·vattha
@N1 = (`holy fig tree of Vidura')
There is a huge pipal or holy fig tree (a·vattha) at the village Do<195><195>akurugo<195>u, ç
about 6 kms. (4 miles) to the north of thetown Gaur<200>bidan<220>r ç
in Kolar district (Karnataka State). As per the local legends it is ç
the off-shoot of the original tree planted by Vidura, the minister ç
of the Kauravas. The tree is on the right bank of the Pin<193>kin<200> ç
river and is surrounded by several small shrines dedicated to <185>iva, ç
N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, Navagrahas and n<193>gas (stone icons of serpents).
The tree is worshipped as holy by the visiting pilgrims.
A big festival is held every year during Caitra P<220>r<207>im<193> ç
(full-moon day in the lunar month of Caitra, usually in April) including ç
the rathotsava (temple car festival).

@NT = vidy<193>
@N1 = (`knowledge,' `science')
@SPACE = 
Derived from the verbal root `vid' (toknow') the term vidy<193> stands ç
for knowledge in general as also for any organised body of knowledge.
The Upani<218>ads divide vidy<193> into two varieties: apar<193>vidy<193> ç
(lower knowledge comprising all worldly sciences including the Vedas) ç
and par<193>vidy<193> (spiritual wisdom resulting in God-experience). ç
Sometimes, they have also used this word to indicate special modes ç
of meditation such as Ak<218>ipuru<218>avidy<193>, Bh<220>mavidy<193> ç
and so on.
Vidy<193>, when understood as <193>tmavidy<193> (realisation of the ç
<193>tman), is posited as the antidote of avidy<193> or nescience.
The Artha·<193>stra (2.1) of Kau<219>ilya (321<MS>B.<|>C.<D>) recognises ç
four kinds of vidy<193>s: <193>nv<200>k<218>ik<200> (logic and metaphysics); ç
tray<200> (the three Vedas excluding the Atharva-veda); v<193>rtt<193> ç
(agriculture, trade and allied vocations); da<207><195>an<200>t<200> ç
(statecraft).
The  Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a  (3.6.28, 29)  lists altogether ç
18 vidy<193>s as follows: 4 Vedas; 6 Ved<193><209>gas; M<200>m<193><221>s<193>; ç
Ny<193>ya; Pur<193><207>as; Dharma·<193>stras; °yurveda; Dhanurveda; ç
G<193>ndharvaveda; Artha·<193>stra.
The 64 kal<193>s (arts) are also sometimes known as vidy<193>s.

@N1 = (`those endowed with the knowledge [of magical spells]')
@SPACE = 
Like Kimpuru<218>as and Kinnaras, the Vidy<193>dharas also are a class ç
of celestial beings. They are said to reside in the Him<193>layan ç
regions. Skilled in several arts and sciences and endowed with magical ç
powers, they are devotees of <185>iva.
Iconographical texts show them as dark in colour, wearing red garments. ç
They have two protruding tusks. In their two hands, they carry a gad<193> ç
(mace) and a <195>amaru (hand-drum). The buffalo is their v<193>hana ç
or mount.

Vidy<193> or knowledge cannot be given to any and every person. There ç
are rules and restrictions regarding imparting it to others.
According to one version the following six persons are vidy<193>dv<193>ras ç
or those fit to receive it: a brahmac<193>ri residing in the guru's ç
house; one who is eager to learn and is prepared to pay the fees; ç
one who is intelligent enough to understand well; one who is learned ç
in the Vedas and wantsto learn other sciences; one who is dear (like ç
a son or a friend, but having the capacity to receive the knowledge); ç
one who is prepared to exchange his specialised knowledge for another ç
field of knowledge.

Darbh<193><209>ga district of Mithil<193> in north Bihar was his native ç
place. Educated by his father and later by one Harimi·ra, he became ç
a great scholar in Sanskrit as also in the local language called Maithil<200>.
@EMERGENCY = He was an intimate friend of <185>ivasi<221>ha, the ruler ç
of Mithil<193>.
@EMERGENCY = Local legends say that Lord <185>iva, charmed by his ç
poetical talents, workedas a servant†Ugan<193> by name†in his house!
During the last days, with the intention of dying on the bank of the ç
river Ga<209>g<193>, he started on the journey in a palanquin. Though ç
he died before reaching the river, it is said that the river itself ç
changed its course and started flowing in the place where he passed ç
away.

@N1 = (`commencement of<R>ç
learning [of the alphabet]')
A child used to be sent to the guru- kula for education after the ç
upanayana ceremony, generally at the age of seven. In the ancient ç
days, the sa<221>sk<193>ra or sacrament of teaching the letters of ç
the alphabet, perhaps, used to be conducted at the time of caula (rite ç
of hair-cutting for the first time) itself, usually at the age of ç
five.
This sa<221>sk<193>ra, known as vidy<193>- rambha or ak<218>ar<193>bhy<193>sa, ç
is quite common even now. It is being performed even at the age of ç
three or four.
Orthodox tradition recommended the following procedure: fixing up ç
an auspicious day, preferably in the uttar<193>ya<207>a (northern ç
solstice) period; bathing and decorating the child; propitiation of ç
the deities Ga<207>apati, Sarasvat<200>, N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, Lak<218>m<200>, ç
B<216>haspati and the family deity; performance of a homa; teaching ç
the alphabet to the child by first writing a mantra such as o<221> ç

the latter. And, the latter becomes impotent without the protection ç

1356).
Moved by the pitiable condition of the contemporary society which ç
had been battered by the repeated invasions of the Muslim marauders ç
and their savagery, Vidy<193>ra<207>ya discovered after a period of ç
intense tapas (austerity), the need to establish a purely Hindu kingdom ç
under the heroic leadership of a suitable person. Fortunately for ç
him, he was able to get the excellent assistance of two k<218>attriya ç
warrior-brothers†Hakka and Bukka† with whom as the nucleus he established ç
the city of Vidy<193>nagara or Vijayanagara. This developed, in course ç
of time, into a glorious Hindu empire which lasted 230 years.
He continued to guide the ruler of the kingdom till his last days. ç
His sam<193>dhi (tomb) is situated at the back of the Vir<220>p<193>k<218>a ç
temple at Hampi (in the Bellary district of Karnataka).
He was the pontiff of the <185><216><209>ger<200> <185><193>rad<193>p<200><219>ha ç
(one of the four monasteries established by <185>a<209>kara [<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
788-820]) from <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1377 to <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1386.

@N1 = (`sciences')
@SB8.5 = Introduction
Though the word vidy<193> normally means learning or knowledge, in ç
a more technical sense it signifies a science or an art.
Indian philosophical thought has reached its acme in the Upani<218>ads. ç
Coming as a reaction to Vedic ritualism and priestcraft, it has to ç
stress the need for realising the spiritual dimensions of man. The ç
sages of the Upani<218>ads with their deep insight into human nature, ç
knew that a total break with the past would be rather difficult for ç
the men steeped lifelong in rituals. Wishing to lead them to higher ç
levels of spiritual experience, step by step, these sages devised ç
several Vidy<193>s or up<193>sanas (mystic meditations) often based ç
on the same rituals which they had practised.
These Vidy<193>s mentioned in the Upani<218>ads and amplified to some ç
extent by the commentators are sometimes listed as 32 in number. A ç
few of them may now be considered here briefly.
@S10N = 1.	Ak<218>ipuru<218>avidy<193> (`science of the<R>ç
	person in the eye')<R>ç
	(Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad 4.15; 8.7.4)
Ak<218>ipuru<218>a means `the person in the eye'. He is identified ç
with the <193>tman. Obviously, he cannot be the reflection seen in ç
the eyeball. He is the person who animates the eye and enables it ç
to see. Or, he is the person seen through the inner eye, after purifying ç
the mind through spiritual disciplines.
He is the dra<218><219><193> (the seer) and not the d<216>·ya (the ç
seen). He is Brahman.
Meditation on him as the seer is the Ak<218>ipuru<218>avidy<193>. ç
The fruits of such meditation are believed to be obtaining all good ç
things, shining in all the worlds and not being reborn after death.
@S10N = 2.	Antar<193>dityavidy<193><M> <D>(`science of the<R>ç
	Person in the Sun')<M><R>ç
	(B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka Upani<218>ad<M> 5.5.2)<D>
This refers to the Puru<218>a or the Cosmic Person in the orb of the ç
sun. He is called tat (That) and satya<221> (Truth). He is related ç
to the person in the right eye of human beings (the j<200>va or the ç
soul), through his rays. When the time comes for the j<200>va to depart ç
from the body he sees the sun without rays (like the full-moon).
The  earth  (bh<220><199>)  and  the  sky (bhuva<199>) are this Cosmic ç
Person's head and arms. The heavens (suva<199>) form his feet. His ç
secret name is `ahas'. One who knows thus, gives up and destroys sins.
@SPACE1 = 
@S10N = 3.	Bh<220>mavidy<193> (`science of the Bh<220>m<193><R>ç

@SPACE1 = <M>
This is one of the most important sections of the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad.
The sage N<193>rada approaches Sanatkum<193>ra, considered a great ç
teacher of spiritual wisdom of his times. Though N<193>rada had mastered ç
19 sciences and fields of knowledge including the four Vedas, he had ç
not attained inner peace and tranquillity.
Sanatkum<193>ra takes him step by step from lower meditations starting ç
with n<193>ma (name) as a symbol for Brahman right up to Bh<220>m<193>, ç
Brahman itself. Though various fruits for these meditations have been ç
predicated they are all inferior and not permanent. Only the knowledge ç
of Bh<220>m<193> leads to the highest bliss and liberation from transmigratory ç
existence. This is followed by a description of Bh<220>m<193> which ç
is the same as the description of Brahman as found in the Upani<218>ads. ç
One who realises it†the teacher declares†will be liberated from all ç
bonds.

@S10N = 4.	Daharavidy<193> (`knowledge of [Brahman]<R>ç
	in the small space [of the heart-lotus]')<R>ç
	(Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad 8.1)
@SPACE1 = <M>
Daharavidy<193> deals with the meditation on Brahman in the region ç
of the heart, compared to a lotus containing a very small space (daharam ç
pu<207><195>ar<200>ka<221>). This <193>k<193>·a (dahar<193>k<193>·a) ç
is itself Brahman containing the earth and the heaven, the sun and ç
the moon, lightning and stars. Since the word °k<193>·a is also a ç
name of Brahman (vide 8.14.1), this method of meditation on the ç
dahar<193>k<193>·a is justi- fiable. As a result of this meditation ç
leading to the realisation of the <193>tman (or Brahman) the s<193>dhaka ç
(the aspirant) will get whatever he wants.
@SPACE1 = 
@S10N = 5.	G<193>yatr<200>vidy<193> (`knowledge of the<R>ç
	G<193>yatr<200>')<R>ç
	(Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad 3.12 and 13)
@SPACE1 = <M>
This is a rather complicated vidy<193> or meditation dealt with in ç
the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad.
G<193>yatr<200> is an important Vedic metre, described as superior ç
to other metres. It is manifested as v<193>k or speech and protects ç
all bh<220>tas or beings. Since these beings are sheltered by p<216>thv<200> ç
or the earth, G<193>yatr<200> and p<216>thv<200> are identical. Man's ç
body including his heart, where his pr<193><207>as or vital airs are ç
situated, is also p<216>thv<200>, and hence the G<193>yatr<200>.
The Vedic metre G<193>yatr<200> has four p<193>das or quarters with ç
six ak<218>aras or letters in each. These six letters can be considered ç
as related to v<193>k (speech), bh<220>ta (beings), p<216>thv<200> ç
(earth), ·ar<200>ra (body), h<216>daya (heart) and pr<193><207>a (vital ç
airs).
Puru<218>a or Brahman is the self of this G<193>yatr<200>. He is to ç
be meditated upon in the <193>k<193>·a (or space) within the heart.
The Upani<218>ad further explains how the pa<210>capr<193><207>as ç
(the five vital airs) within the heart are related to <193>ditya (the ç
sun), candra (the moon), agni (the fire), parjanya (the air) and <193>k<193>·a ç
(the sky). Up<193>san<193>s or meditations on these in the prescribed ç
manner will lead to several extraordinary results (ibid 3.13.1-6).

This vidy<193> (knowledge or meditation) is described in the Ch<193>ndogya ç
Upani<218>ad (3.1 to 11). It is primarily connected with the up<193>san<193> ç
(meditation) on the °ditya (the deity Sun) who is described as devamadhu ç
or honey of the gods since he brings joy (like madhu or honey) to ç
them.

Honey is stored in the honeycomb, in its chambers. The honeycomb is ç
built up on a beam or any beamlike structure, by the honeybees. They ç
collect honey from various flowers.
@SPACE1 = 
This analogy is now applied to °ditya as follows:
@SPACE1 = 
Antarik<218>a (sky) is the honeycomb. Dyuloka (heavenly regions) is ç
the beam. Rays (of the sun) are the chambers or holes. Water particles ç
in the rays are the small eggs (of the honey bees). The four Vedas†<184>k, ç
Yajus, S<193>ma and Atharva† are the bees. Vedic rituals are ç
the flowers from which honey is collected. The results of performance ç
of these rituals, viz., ya·as (fame), tejas (bodily lustre), indriya ç
(vigour of the senses), v<200>rya (strength) and ann<193>dya (food) ç
are all stored in °ditya.
@SPACE1 = 
The various Vedic deities enjoy this honey in °ditya with the more ç
important ones as their leaders, as follows:
@SPACE1 = 
Eight Vasus with Agni; Eleven Rudras with Indra, Twelve °dityas with ç
Varu<207>a; Twenty-one Maruts with Soma and Twelve S<193>dhyas with ç
Brahm<193>.

Any s<193>dhaka (spiritual aspirant) who understands this and practises ç
meditation as the deities did, will attain the same results as they ç
got, ultimately realising Brahman (ibid 3.12.3).

The duly established Vedic fire has several parts like fire, fuel, ç
smoke, blazing tongues, embers and sparks. Offerings of ghee or rice-cake ç
are poured into it. This results in a specific fruit or product.
The five fires mentioned in this Vidy<193> are: dyuloka (sky); parjanya ç
(rain); loka (this world); puru<218>a (man); and, yo<218><193> (woman).
Various parts or acts which are connected with these are compared ç
to the parts of fire and the oblation poured into it. Specific results ç
are also assured if meditation is practised according to the directions ç

This Vidy<193> is dealt with in the first chapter of the Kau<218><200>taki ç
Br<193>hma<207>a Upani<218>ad.
Citra G<193>rgy<193>ya<207>i wanted to perform a sacrifice. He chose ç
Gautama °ru<207>i to be the chief priest and sent for him. Gautama, ç
however, sent his son <185>vetaketu instead. When the latter went ç
to Citra, he was tested first with some questions which he was unable ç
to answer. Since Gautama too was ignorant of the same, both he and ç
his son <185>vetaketu approached Citra as disciples to be instructed ç
by him. What Citra taught them has now become known as Parya<209>kavidy<193>.
The Upani<218>ad refers to the two well-known paths Devay<193>na (or ç
Arcir<193>di-m<193>rga) and Pit<216>y<193>na (or Dh<220>m<193>dim<193>rga). ç
When the j<200>va (individual soul) reaches Candra (the Moon) on his ç
journey after death, he has to go beyond it by rejecting the offer ç
of svarga (heavenly enjoyments) and start treading the path of Devay<193>na. ç
After passing through the various worlds of V<193>yu, Varu<207>a and ç
so on, he reaches the world of Hira<207>yagarbha or Brahm<193>.
Before reaching Brahm<193>, this j<200>va has to cross the lake °ra, ç
the river Viraj<193>, enter the city of Brahm<193> called S<193>lajja ç
and then approach Brahm<193> seated on the Parya<209>ka (couch) in ç
his palace Apar<193>jita. After reaching him, the j<200>va ascends ç
the Parya<209>ka with one foot at first.
Then there is a long passage containing the conversation between Brahm<193> ç
and j<200>va.
Once the j<200>va reaches the world of Brahm<193> and ascends the ç
Parya<209>ka he is liberated and will not return to mundane existence.
The Upani<218>ad is full of descriptions which are highly symbolical.
