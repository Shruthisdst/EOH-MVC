N<193>nd<200>·r<193>ddha is to be done on the previous day. The next ç
day, a homa has to be performed to Vi<218><207>u with 64 oblations ç
of boiled rice mixed with ghee using <184>gvedic mantras (such as ç
1.22.16-21; 10.90.1-16 and so on).
To the northeast of the fire a square plot with 64 small squares should ç
be prepared. Cooked rice balls are kept in these squares. They are ç
offered first by the <184>gvedic mantras. One ball from them is offered ç
to Vi<218><207>u with the mantra O<221> namo n<193>r<193>ya<207><193>ya. ç
The husband and wife should partake of two rice balls of the same ç
separately as pras<193>da or consecrated food.

This is an upapur<193><207>a which has not yet been printed. It is ç
a fairly voluminous work  dealing  mainly  with  Vai<218><207>ava ç
philosophy and rituals. It might have been compiled during the third ç
century <MS>A.<|>D.<D> It has 105 chapters and 4000 verses.
The work deals mainly with the ritesand duties of the Vai<218><207>avas. ç
Other subjects  are:  political  administration, duties of women and ç
a few legends.
Quite a few writers of sm<216>ti have drawn upon this work.
@NT = Vi<218><207>udharmas<220>tra
This is one of the dharma·<193>stra works in the form of s<220>tras.
The text as available in print at present, seems to be a mixture of ç
an earlier old part and a later part grafted on to it. The earlier ç
prose part in the form of s<220>tras probably belongs to the period ç
300 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> to <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 100. The later part in poetry may ç
be assigned to the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 400-600.
It has 100 chapters, most of them being brief or even very short.
A brief synopsis of the contents may now be given:
The four var<207>as and their dharmas; duties of kings; various offences ç
and their punishments; mixed castes and their offsprings; death-rites ç
and associated rules; on marriages including inter-marriages; duties ç
of women; various sa<221>sk<193>ras; sins and expiations; descriptions ç
of various hells; ·r<193>ddhas; anatomy of the human body; hymns of ç
praise to V<193>sudeva by Bh<220>(Earth) and <185>r<200> (Lak<218>m<200>).
The whole work professes to be a revelation by Lord Vi<218><207>u. ç
However it seems to borrow the material from other (earlier) sm<216>tis ç
like those of Manu and Y<193>j<210>avalkya.
There  is  a  commentary  called Vaijayant<200> by Nandapa<207><195>ita ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1623) which has been published.
@NT = Vi<218><207>udharmottarapur<193><207>a
Though classed among the upa-pur<193><207>as, this is an important ç
work quite extensive and encyclopaedic in nature. Itis in three sections. ç
The following is a very brief account of its contents; geography, ç
astronomy and astrology; pacification of unfavourable stars and plants; ç
omens and portents; marriage and duties of women; penances; vratas ç
or religious vows and observances;  ·r<193>ddhas  (funeral  rites); ç
duties of Vai<218><207>avas; science of war and allied topics; medical ç
sciences; music and dancing; sculpture and Vai<218><207>ava theology.
It might have been compiled around <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 400 to 500.
Its contents have been widely used by the writers of dharma·<193>stras.
@NT = Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a
For over two millennia, the pur<193><207>as† the most popular scriptures ç
of Hinduism† have proved to be a source, not only of knowledge and ç
wisdom but also of spiritual solace. Of the eighteen Mah<193>pur<193><207>as, ç
the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a is, perhaps, the earliest compilation ç
(assigned to the period 100 <MS>B.C.<D>-<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 400) and accords ç
well with the five general characteristics of the pur<193><207>as ç
like sarga (creation), pratisarga (inter- mediate creation) and so ç
on (See <MS>PUR°ØAS<D>.).
Though the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a is said to have contained ç
23,000 verses, the printed texts as available now have only 6400 verses ç
spread over 126 chapters, arranged in the form of six a<221>·as or ç
Books.
Unlike the other pur<193><207>as where generally the S<220>ta Romahar<218>a<207>a ç
narrates the stories after being questioned by some sages, this pur<193><207>a ç
is narrated by the sage Par<193>·ara (father of Vy<193>sa and grandson ç
of Vasi<218><219>ha) to his disciple Maitreya.
Though most of the work is in poetry, it has elegant prose passages ç
also. In fact, it has all the characteristics of a good literary classic.
It has three commentaries:
°tmaprak<193>·a  by  <185>r<200>dhara  (15th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>); ç
Vai<218><207>av<193>k<220>tacandrik<193> by Ratnagarbha; and, Vi<218><207>ucitt<200>ya ç
by an unknown author.
The contents of the six a<221>·as may now be given briefly as follows:

@S10N = Sixth A<221>·a (8 chapters; 498 verses)
Interesting and long description of the behaviour of the people in ç

the glories of Lord K<216><218><207>a are enough to attain liberation; ç
description of pralaya or dissolution of the world; eulogy of this ç
pur<193><207>a.
The Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a has some special features which ç
may now be dealt with under appropriate headings:
@SPACE = 
@SB8.5 = Philosophy
@SPACE = 
The philosophy of the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a is practically ç
the same as the Ved<193>nta of the Upani<218>ads.
God the Absolute, though called Vi<218><207>u here, is not just the ç
Vi<218><207>u of the Trinity responsible for the sustenance ofthe ç
created world. He is Parabrahman, of the nature of j<210><193>na (knowledge ç
or consciousness) and absolutely pure. The appearance of this world ç
as an entity separate from him is only an illusion (1.2-6).
Brahm<193>, Vi<218><207>u and Mahe·vara of the Trinity are actually ç
the three aspects of this Param<193>tman as associated with thethree ç
gu<207>as (rajas, sattva and tamas) (vide 1.2.56 and 66; 1.4.15; ç
1.9.56).
The description of the process of creation is similar to that of the ç
S<193><209>khya philosophy (1.2.28-70). However, in this pur<193><207>a ç
Vi<218><207>u is the original and absolute cause. The world evolves ç
out of him† called Vi<218><207>u (1.1.31) or K<216><218><207>a (4.12.4)† ç
through his power called pradh<193>na or prak<216>ti.
Even the infinite numbers of the j<200>vas (individual beings) are ç
the reflections of the one Vi<218><207>u seen due to avidy<193> or ç
nescience.
The pur<193><207>a accepts the karma (or actions) sanctioned by the ç
scriptures and bhakti or devotion to God (Vi<218><207>u) as the primary ç
means of mok<218>a or liberation. Ni<218>k<193>makarma (selfless action) ç
purifies the mind. Vi<218><207>u gets established in such a mind. ç
Dhy<193>na or meditation on the beautiful form of Vi<218><207>u along ç
with the repetition of the dv<193>da·<193>k<218>ar<200>mantra (mantra ç
of twelve syllables viz., o<221> namo bhagavate v<193>sudev<193>ya) ç
will lead to j<210><193>na and mok<218>a.
However, the role of bhakti has beenhighlighted, through the story ç
of Prahl<193>da.
@SPACE = 
@SB8.5 = Va<221>·<193>valis or Lineages
@SPACE = 
Another speciality of this pur<193><207>a is the long lists of kings ç
and their lineage belonging  to  the  famous  S<220>ryava<221>·a (Solar ç
race) and the Candra or Soma va<221>·a (Lunar race).
It is interesting to note that both these races start from Vi<218><207>u ç
Himself!
The prominent kings of the S<220>ryava<221>·a include the following ç
ones: Vivasv<193>n, Manu, Ik<218>v<193>ku, M<193>ndh<193>t<193>, Hari·candra, ç
Bhag<200>ratha, Da·aratha, <185>r<200> R<193>ma and Agnivar<207>a. ç
The last king, Maru by name, is said to be in yoga, living even now ç
in the village Kal<193>pa. He will restart the va<221>·a in the next ç
K<216>tayuga!
Another branch of the S<220>ryava<221>·a started with Nimi (the son ç
of Ik<218>v<193>ku) in which the Janakas such as Janakavaideha and ç
S<200>radhvaja Janaka, were the prominent ones. They excelled in spiritual ç
wisdom.
In the Somava<221>·a or the Candra-va<221>·a, the following kings ç
were famous: Candra, Budha, Pur<220>rava, Nahu<218>a, Dhanvantari, ç
Yay<193>ti, Yadu, Du<218>yanta, Kuru, Jar<193>sandha, Kauravas and ç
P<193><207><195>avas. <185>r<200>K<216><218><207>a belonged to the ç
Yaduva<221>·a.
Mah<193>padmananda was the last king of the race descended from Jar<193>sandha.
Like Maru of the S<220>ryava<221>·a, Dev<193>pi of the Candrava<221>·a ç
is said to be the last king still alive in yoga in the same village ç
Kal<193>pa. He will restart the race in future.
@SB8.5 = Description of Kaliyuga
Though the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a gives a long description ç
of the Kaliyuga, the age wherein people become unrighteous and evil ç
to the core (vide 5.1.10-58), it also points out the three advantages ç
that people have in that age. They are: People get the highest spiritual ç
benefits just by singing the names and glories of God; women get all ç
the merit of the good deeds by serving their husbands sincerely; ·<220>dras ç
attain religious merit by performing their duties well.
@SB8.5 = The Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a and the Bh<193>gavata
The Bh<193>gavata seems to be an elabo- ration of the stories and ç
ideas contained in the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a. Whereas the ç
latter deals only with five avat<193>ras or incarnations out of the ç
well-known ten, the Bh<193>gavata deals in detail with all the ten ç
and a few more. Though bhakti or devotion finds an important place ç
in the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a, in the Bh<193>gavata it is ç
allpervading. However, it has to be conceded that the language of ç
the latter is quite archaic and tough whereas that of the former is ç
simple and elegant.
@SB8.5 = Literary Grace
The Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a has certain special features. Its ç
language, though simple and elegant, is also highly poetic. Descriptions ç
of nature are not only beautiful but alsocontain excellent similes ç
bearing on philosophical and ethical principles (vide 5.10.2-15). ç
There are verses praising Bharatakha<207><195>a (India) as karmabh<220>mi ç
(the land of good deeds) and that one is born here only out of religious ç
merit (2.3.23, 24).
There are also verses pregnant with worldly wisdom which have been ç
used as subh<193><218>itas (maxims) (vide 4.10.26, 27).
There is no doubt that the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a has been ç
a beacon light for the well-known classic, the Bh<193>gavata.
See also <MS>BH°GAVATA<D> and <MS>PUR°ØAS<D>.
@NT = Vi<218><207>usahasran<193>ma
@N1 = (`thousand names of Vi<218><207>u)
In Hinduism, stotras or hymns of God are legion. Out of these, the ç
a<218><219>ottara- ·atan<193>mas (with 108 names) and sahasra-n<193>mas ç
(with 1000 names) are a class by themselves.
In the latter group, two sahasra-n<193>mas are considered outstanding ç
and extremely popular even now. They are: the Lalit<193>sahasran<193>ma ç
and the Vi<218><207>u- sahasran<193>ma, dedicated respectively to ç
the Divine Mother Lalit<193> (an aspect of Dev<200> P<193>rvat<200>) ç
and Lord Vi<218><207>u or N<193>r<193>ya<207>a. In fact, they are ç
considered, not as just hymns of praise, but as mantras (mystical ç
texts) potent with spiritual vibrations.
The  Vi<218><207>usahasran<193>ma,  like  the Bhagavadg<200>t<193>, ç
is an integral part of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata (Anu·<193>sanaparv<%22>a<D%0>149.1-142)<%-8>.<%0>
Verses 1 to 13 form the introduction called p<220>rvap<200><219>hik<193>. ç
The actual Sahasra-n<193>ma is spread over verses 14 to 120. Thereafter, ç
the phala·ruti (fruits of recitation) is given in the last part comprising ç
verses 121 to 142.
The recitation of such hymns as this is considered superior to the ç
performance of Vedic sacrifices and is as good as a ritualistic worship ç
of God due to the following reasons: It does not need the help of ç
other human beings or money and materials. The rules of de·a (place ç
of performance) and k<193>la (auspicious times) do not apply to its ç
chanting. Irrespective of caste or creed all are free to chant it ç
provided they have faith. It does not involve violence to living beings.
The deeper meaning and significance of such esoteric texts can be ç
known only through the commentaries written by competent scholars. ç
It is interesting to note that so far, at least 15 commentaries (in ç
Sanskrit) have been discovered on this hymn. Out of these the following ç
three are more well-known:

@NID = 1.

@NK-1LS = Satyasandh<200>ya by<R>ç
Satyasandhat<200>rtha of Uttar<193>dima<219>ha (18th century).
These three commentaries represent the three main systems of Ved<193>nta ç
viz., Advaita, Vi<218>i<218><219><193>dvaita and Dvaita.
The Vi<218><207>usahasran<193>ma is mainly meant for chanting, either ç
independently or as a part of a rite. The individual names may also ç
be separately used in arcana (offering with flowers in worship).
For chanting it, there is a standard ritual method. First the names ç
of the <216><218>i (the sage through whom it was revealed), the devat<193> ç
(the deity to whom it is addressed) and the chandas (the metre in ç
which it is composed) have to be recited. For this hymn, these are: ç
Vedavy<193>sa, N<193>r<193>ya<207>a and anu<218><219>ubh.
This is followed by viniyoga or the purpose for which the hymn is ç
chanted. Here, the general purpose is to please the Lord. However, ç
if the devotee has any particular purpose or desire to be fulfilled, ç
that may be properly mentioned.
Then comes dhy<193>na or meditation onthe form of the deity. This ç
is usually done by chanting a dhy<193>na·loka (hymn ofmeditation) ç
which gives a detailed description of the form.
In the Vi<218><207>usahasran<193>ma tradition however, nine ·lokas ç
are given as dhy<193>na-·lokas and hence all of them are to be chanted.
As regards the actual chanting, two methods are being followed. In ç
the first, the following is the sequence: <216><218>y<193>diny<193>sa; ç
dhy<193>na; actual Sahasran<193>ma (verses 14 to 120).
In the second, the introductory part (verses 1 to 13) and the phala·ruti ç
(eulogy, verses 121 to 142) are also included. Sometimes, 8 more verses ç
are added in the very beginning. Printed texts meant exclusively for ç
chanting contain all these details.
@SPACE1 = 
Bh<200><218>ma the grandsire was laying down on the bed of arrows, ç
awaiting death at an auspicious moment. It was during this period ç
that he was teaching the duties of a king to Yudhi<218><219>hira the ç
eldest of the P<193><207><195>avas. The Vi<218><207>usahasran<193>ma ç
was taught by him then, when Yudhi<218><219>hira put him six questions ç
about the highest God who has to be praised and worshipped, and repetition ç
of whose name will lead to liberation.
There are exactly 1000 names in the hymn. Though some of the names ç
have been repeated more than once, the commentators have justified ç
them with appropriate explanations.
From out of these thousand names, Hindu religious tradition has selected ç
a few, to be used in an appropriate form, to fulfil one's desires. ç
For instance:

The numbers in the brackets indicate the serial number of the name ç
(according to the <185><193><209>karabh<193><218>ya).
The actual method of japa has to be learnt from the experts in the ç
field of s<193>dhana or spiritual practice.
One of the lists available gives 118 such mantras.
This much can definitely be said thatthe Vi<218><207>usahasran<193>ma ç
is extremely popular even now. It is extensively usedin temple rituals ç
and on religious occasions.
@NT = Vi<218><207>us<220>kta
@N1 = (`the hymn [dealing with] Vi<218><207>u')
The Vedas contain several hymns known as S<220>ktas, addressed to ç
different deities. The <184>gveda itself is said to contain 1017 ç
such S<220>ktas.
The Vi<218><207>us<220>kta is one such important hymn addressed ç
to Lord Vi<218><207>u.
There are two versions, one being in the <184>gveda and the other ç
in the Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193>. The former is actually a ç
hymnof 45 <216>ks or verses culled from four different places of ç
the <184>gveda. The latter is a smaller one with only 12 verses ç
out of which eleven are taken from the <184>gveda itself.
These s<220>ktas may be ceremonially chanted as japa to get specific ç
results or may be used in Vedic sacrifices at the appropriate places. ç
For instance, if the mantra `tad vipr<193>so....' (eleventh mantra; ç
