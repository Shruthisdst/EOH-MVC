V<193>c or V<193>k†also known as Ambh<216><207><200> †is one of the ç
Vedic women-sages to whomthe Dev<200>s<220>kta (<184>gveda 10.125) ç
was revealed. See <MS>DEV®S<188>KTA<D> for details.
V<193>c  (v<193>k)  as  speech  has  been described in the Vedic literature ç
in various ways.
The <185>atapatha Br<193>hma<207>a (4.1.3.16) divides speech into ç
four kinds: that of human beings, of animals, of birds and of small ç
creeping things. The Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> (6.4.7.3) says ç
that Indra made the articulate speech. It also refers to three musical ç
instruments†t<220><207>ava (flute), v<200><207><193> (lute) and dundubhi ç
(kettle-drum) (ibid 6.1.4.1).
Coming to the human speech, that of the Kuru-P<193><210>c<193>las ç
was considered very good and fit to be learnt by others (vide <185>atapatha ç
Br<193>hma<207>a 3.2.3.15; Kau<218><200>taki Br<193>hma<207>a 7.6). ç
The asuras were known for their barbarian speech (<185>atapatha Br<193>hma<207>a ç
3.2.1.23,24) and hence had to be avoided.
Sometimes speech is categorised as daiv<200> (divine) and m<193>nu<218><200> ç
(human). For instance Om is daiv<200> whereas tath<193> is m<193>nu<218><200> ç
(vide K<193><219>haka Sa<221>hit<193> 14.5). A br<193>hma<207>a ç
is said to know both. Probably this categorisation refers to the language ç
used in Vedic rituals and in daily life.
As regards the evolution of speech from the subtle to the gross stages ç
see <MS>PAR°<D> for details.
V<193>c is one of the names of the goddess Sarasvat<200>. (See <MS>SARASVAT®<D> ç

@N1 = (`[poetical] sayings')
The vacanas are a special kind of literary compositions in the Kannada ç
language. They  are  religious  or  semi- religious lyrics in the ç
local colloquial language. They appear like prose but are flavoured ç
with poetical grace. The credit of discovering and introducing these ç
goes to the V<200>ra·aiva saints like Basave·vara (12th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>), ç
Allamaprabhu (12th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>), Akkamah<193>dev<200> (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1130-1166) and a host of others.
The primary purpose of these vacanas is to carry the essential teachings ç
of philosophy, religion, morality and social values to the common ç
folk in their own language.
Though the number of the vacana-k<193>ras (composers of the vacanas) ç

This has six sub-commentaries. His interpretation of Advaita Ved<193>nta ç

@NT = v<193>cika
@N1 = (`pertaining to speech')
This word has been used more as an adjective than as a noun.
As a noun it means any news or a message sent by word or mouth.
As an adjective its meaning changes according to the word it qualifies. ç
For instance:
V<193>cika-tapas is tapas or austerity of speech. According to the ç
Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (17.15) it is a speech which is true, sweet ç
and brings about nothing but good. It should be without agitation ç
and anxiety. Study of one's own branch of Veda and repetition of the ç
divine name also comes under this definition.
V<193>cika-do<218>as or defects of speech are: telling lies, castigating ç
others, deeply hurting the feelings of others, praising oneself and ç
carrying tales about others.
V<193>cika-p<193>pas or sins committed by word of mouth are: speaking ç
very harshly, telling lies especially to hurt others, finding fault, ç
and raving.
@NT = v<193>da
@N1 = (`discussion')
The word v<193>da is a technical term used by the Ny<193>ya philosophy ç
(vide Ny<193>yas<220>tras (1.2.1). It means discussion and is adoption ç
of one of the two opposing sides. It is conducted according to logical ç
rules and aims only at finding out the truth.
In it, both the v<193>d<200> (exponent) and the pravtiv<193>d<200> ç
(opponent) try to establish their own positions and refute that of ç
the other with logic, quotations from authoritative sources and answering ç
objections. This is very well illustrated by a philosophical discussion ç
between the teacher and his student.
However, during the middle-ages, v<193>da or disputation among scholars ç
to establish their supremacy was very common.

@N1 = (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1480-1600)
V<193>dir<193>ja or V<193>dir<193>ja-t<200>rtha is one of the brightest ç
stars among the sa<221>ny<193>sins of the M<193>dhva tradition. He ç
was a monk par excellence, a gigantic intellect and a yogi of the ç
highest order endowed with supernatural psychic powers. He was the ç
first to enter the B<216>nd<193>vana while still living. (See also ç
<MS>R°GHAVENDRA-T®RTHA<D>.)
He was the head of the Sv<193>d<200> or Sode Ma<219>ha, one of the ç
eight Ma<219>has (pontifical seats) established by Madhv<193>-c<193>rya ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1238-1317). He lived for 120 years.
He was born as the first son of R<193>mabha<219><219>a and Gaur<200>dev<200> ç
at H<220>vinakere, a small village in the South Canara district of ç
Karnataka State in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1480.
He  practically  grew  up  in  the monastery (Sode Ma<219>ha) under ç
the loving care of its then pontiff, V<193>g<200>·a who also educated ç
him in all branches of learning necessary for a spiritual teacher.
He  was  later  initiated  into  the monastic life with the new name ç
V<193>dir<193>ja-t<200>rtha. In course of time he succeeded his guru ç
V<193>g<200>·a, to the pontifical seat.
His achievements as the pontiff of the Sode Ma<219>ha and as a spiritual ç
teacher are very impressive. He reorganised the pary<193>ya system†taking ç
turns for the worship of <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a at the U<195>upi ç
temple †from that of two months to that of two years. He toured the ç
country several times to spread the doctrines of Dvaita Ved<193>nta ç
as also the cult of devotion to Vi<218><207>u. He wrote several scholarly ç
works in support of the Dvaita Ved<193>nta philosophy such asGurur<193>j<200>ya-sudh<193>-<219>ippa<207>i, ç
T<193>tparya-nir<207>aya<219><200>k<193>, Yuktimallik<193>, Bhagavadg<200>t<193>-<219>ippa<207>i ç
and Tantras<193>ra<219><200>k<193> in Sanskrit. His treatises in ç
Kannada are: Kanna<195>a-t<193>tparya nir<207>aya and Bhramarag<200>t<193>.
He also composed several devotional songs in the Kanna<195>a language ç
and continued the tradition of singing them in the M<193>dhva monasteries.
He was a devoted worshipper of Hayagr<200>va (an aspect of Vi<218><207>u) ç
and had attained great yogic powers which he often used for the benefit ç
of the devotees and the supplicants.
He was a junior contemporary of Vy<193>sat<200>rtha or Vy<193>sar<193>ya ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1447-1539) †another great scholarly saint†under whom ç
he was trained in the Ved<193>ntic scriptures for some time.

@NT = v<193>hana
@N1 = (`mount', `vehicle')
There are many deities in the Hindu pantheon. Most of them have a ç
v<193>hana or carrier vehicle, usually animals or birds. These deities ç
are supposed to ride or be seated on them.

A particular v<193>hana for a particular deity has not only a legendary ç
association †generally as depicted in the pur<193><207>as† but also ç
a symbolical meaning.
According to the K<193>lik<193>pur<193><207>a (Chapter 57), the v<193>hanas ç
are only transformations of the deities themselves.
Iconographically,  a  deity  is  not necessarily represented as riding ç
the v<193>hana. The latter may be merely indicated on the pedestal ç
of the image.
Sometimes the v<193>hanas are independently installed in front of ç
the main icon outside the sanctum facing it or even in separate pavilions.
During the festivals in the big temples, especially during the rathotsava ç
(car- festival), the utsavam<220>rtis (processional images), gorgeously ç
decorated, may be seated on a v<193>hana and taken round the streets ç
in a colourful procession. On such occasions there may not be any ç
specific association of the v<193>hana with the deity. The v<193>hanas ç
used, made of wood or metal or both, may be anyone of the following: ç
gaja (elephant), v<216><218>abha (bull), a·va (horse), ·e<218>a (serpent), ç
·ibik<193> (palanquin), ha<221>sa (swan), si<221>ha (lion), Hanum<193>n, ç
Garu<195>a and ratha (chariot).
@NT = vaidh<200>bhakti

Bhakti or devotion has been categorised in different ways. One of ç
them is vaidh<200>bhakti and r<193>g<193>nug<193>bhakti.
The former is devotion associated with many preliminary rules and ç
regulations like physical and ceremonial purity, ritualistic worship, ç

so on. See also <MS>R°G°NUGABHAKTI<D>.

If somebody says that, since ·abda (sound) and r<220>pa (form) are ç
both indriya-gr<193>hya (perceived by the sense-organs), let them ç
be considered identical, the reply is that the sense-organs that perceive ç
them (i.e., the ear and the eye) being vij<193>ti (of different natures) ç
they (·abda and r<220>pa) too are different. This kind of argument ç
is vaij<193>tya.
@NT = Vaijayant<200>
@N1 = (`that which conquers the<R>ç

The Vaijayant<200> or Vaijayanta is the name of the flower-garland ç

(the subtle elements). Lord Vi<218><207>u being the creator and sustainer ç
of this world, even the subtle elements out of which he creates, are ç

the P<193><210>car<193>tra °gamas and the Vaikh<193>nasa <193>gama.
The latter derives its name from the sage Vikhanas who was the founder.
@SB8.5 = Vikhanas, the Founder
Vikhanas was a sage of great anti-quity regarded as an incarnation ç
of Vi<218><207>u (or an emanation from him, of Vedic wisdom) who popularised ç
the cult of Vi<218><207>u in the country. He is sometimes identified ç
with the creator, the four faced Brahm<193>, also. He is said to have ç
written two treatises†the Vaikh<193>nasa Kalpas<220>tras and the ç
Daivikas<220>tras.
He had four chief disciples†Mar<200>ci, Atri, Bh<216>gu and K<193>·yapa†to ç
whom he taught the worship of Vi<218><207>u in great detail.
Iconographical works describe that he is white in complexion, is clothed ç
in golden coloured garments and has four arms. He holds a da<207><195>a ç
(staff) and has the ruru (antelope) as his mount. He is generally ç
shown with his four disciples. His image has to be installed at the ç
right side of the entrance to the mukhama<207><195>apa (front porch) ç

@SB8.5 = The Vaikh<193>nasa Philosophy
@SPACE = 
@SPACE = 
Based on the commentary of <185>r<200>niv<193>sa Makhin on the Ved<193>ntas<220>tras ç
of B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a as mentioned above, one Raghupati Bha<219><219><193>c<193>rya ç
(also known as V<193>sudeva) composed a work called Mok<218>o-p<193>yaprad<200>pik<193>. ç
Here he has systematised the philosophy of the Vaikh<193>nasa °gamas ç
which is practically the same as the Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita of ç
R<193>m<193>nuja (<MS>A.<|>D. <D>1017-1137). It is in prose and has ç
twelve sections.
Brahman  or  Param<193>tman  is  the highest and independent reality. ç
He has two aspects: the ni<218>kala (devoid of form and attributes) ç
and the sakala (with form and attributes).
In the sakala aspect he (known as Vi<218><207>u or N<193>r<193>ya<207>a) ç
is inseparably associ-ated with Lak<218>m<200>, even as the moon and ç
its light are. He is ®·vara, the supreme Lord, with the insentient ç
prak<216>ti (made up of the three gu<207>as sattva, rajas and tamas) ç
and the sentient puru<218>as (j<200>vas or individual souls)†which ç
are also eternal† under his absolute control as dependent realities.
These j<200>vas who are atomic in size, are of three classes: nitya ç
(immutable or changeless like Ananta [or °di·e<218>a], Sanaka and ç
others); Mukta (emancipated, though once in bondage); and, baddha ç
(bound, souls bound by their pr<193>rabdha-karma).
@SPACE1 = 
The baddha or the bound souls have been fettered, by being deluded ç
by the m<193>y<193> of ®·vara (Vi<218><207>u) and can get liberation ç
only by seeking refuge in him, through devoted worship.
The means of liberation are: j<210><193>na (knowledge); up<193>san<193> ç
(worship); prapatti (surrender); karma (ritualistic action).
However, sam<193>r<193>dhana (worshipping N<193>r<193>ya<207>a with ç
intense devotion) is projected as the most effective s<193>dhana. ç
This can take any one of the following four forms: japa (repetition ç
of divine name); huta or homa (fire-sacrifices); arcan<193> (iconic ç
worship); dhy<193>na (meditation).
Whereas huta is the worship of God in the am<220>rta (an-iconic) form, ç
arcan<193> in the iconic form has been declared to be the most effective ç
of all.
Mukti (emancipation) is of four types: s<193>lokya (to live in the ç
world of God); s<193>m<200>pya (to live near God); s<193>r<220>pya ç
(to have a form similar to that of God) and s<193>yujya (being united ç
with or merged in God). The last is considered the real mukti.
The Vaikh<193>nasa treatises speak of four realms of Vi<218><207>u ç
with one aspect of his, presiding over each. They are:

@L3 = °moda	Vi<218><207>u<R>ç
Pramoda	Mah<193>vi<218><207>u<R>ç
Sammoda	Sad<193>vi<218><207>u<R>ç
Vaiku<207><219>ha	N<193>r<193>ya<207>a<R>ç
	(or Vy<193>pi-N<193>r<193>ya<207>a)
@SPACE1 = 
@SPACE1 = 
@SPACE1 = 
@SPACE1 = 
The four types of mukti mentioned are respectively related to these ç
four realms. In the last state, the liberated soul enters into the ç
supreme light and enjoys everlasting bliss.
Corresponding to the four vy<220>has of the P<193><210>car<193>tra ç
system Vaikh<193>nasa too posits four aspects of Vi<218><207>u who ç
is called the °dim<220>rti.
The four forms are: Puru<218>a, representing the quality dharma (righteousness); ç
Satya, the quality j<210><193>na (know- ledge); Acyuta, the quality ç
ai·varya (glory); Aniruddha, the quality vair<193>gya (detachment).
Some aspects of yoga like pr<193><207><193>y<193>ma, n<193><195><200>s, ç
ku<207><195>alin<200>, and cakras are also dealt with in the treatises ç
of this °gama.
@SB8.5 = The Vaikh<193>nasa Community
The vaikh<193>nasas are a community of temple priests. They are ordained ç
by birth to be priests and have to follow only that avocation in ç
life.
The sacramental rites that are prevalent in a vaikh<193>nasa household ç
include a unique ceremony called Vi<218><207>ubali (or garbhacakrasa<221>sk<193>ra). ç
It is performed after the s<200>manta (See <MS>S®MANTONNAYANA<D> for ç
details), the ritual before childbirth conducted for the mother, in ç
the bright half of the eighth month of pregnancy. It involves a homa ç
and then offering to the pregnant mother, p<193>yasa (sweet rice- ç
pudding) in which the emblem cakra (discus-emblem of Vi<218><207>u) ç
and ·a<209>kha (conch) have been previously dipped and a part offered ç
in homa. While the woman is drinking it, a special mantra is recited. ç
The belief is that during this ritual, Lord Vi<218><207>u himself ç
will brand the arms of the child to be born, with the marks of ·a<209>kha ç
(conch) and cakra (discus), which he carries in his own hands.
The practical import of this ceremony is that the child born as a ç
vaikh<193>nasa has already been sanctified by Vi<218><207>u himself ç
and hence needs no more initiatory rites as the P<193><210>car<193>tras ç
do. He acquires the right to be a priest of Vi<218><207>u by birth. ç
He can perform the worship both at home and in temples after formal ç
training in the process of worship.
The vaikh<193>nasas take to worship in temples as priests, not for ç
eking out a living†such priests are called devalakas †but with a sense ç
of duty and obligation. It is the responsibility of the temple management ç
to provide for their maintenance.
The vaikh<193>nasas bestow a very high place to the priest who worships ç
in a temple. Whereas the icon acquires divinity after <193>v<193>hana ç
(invoking), divinity, according to them, abides in him permanently.
Recitation of the °tmas<220>kta (Vaikh<193>-nasa  Sa<221>hit<193>,  Mantrapra·na  5.49) ç
enables the priest to get identified with the cosmic form of Vi<218><207>u.
@SB8.5 = Temple Images of Worship
The vaikh<193>nasa mode of worship is essentially oriented towards ç
Vi<218><207>u. In temples adopting this mode, there will generally ç
be four or five icons of worship. The dhruvabera is the permanently ç
fixed stone image. Next comes the kautukabera, an exact replica of ç
the original (but smaller in size) which receives the daily worship, ç
hence being called arcan<193>bera also. Then comes the snapanabera, ç
an image used for naimittika or occasional rituals. Last is the utsavabera ç
or autsavabera, used inworship for the sake of people who aremotivated ç
by worldly desires (k<193>my<193>rcan<193>).
The kautukabera rests on an arcan<193>-p<200><219>ha, a seat of worship. ç
The snapanabera is placed in another enclosure called snapanama<207><195>apa ç
which is outside the sanctum. The utsavabera too has its own special ç
place.
Vi<218><207>u is said to have taken three strides (vide Vi<218><207>us<220>kta ç
3). If the dhruva-bera is Vi<218><207>u in the original posture, the ç
three other images represent the same Vi<218><207>u in his three steps: ç
kautukabera is the first step, snapanabera, the second step and the ç
utsavabera, the third step. It is the spirit of the same original ç
icon that has entered into the other three.
Sometimes another icon is added to these three movable images, called ç
the balibera. This is used for the sake of distributing food daily ç
to the attendant deities located in the enclosures.
If the same movable icon is used for all purposes, it is known as ç
bhogabera.
Sometimes the system of having five icons for one deity is compared ç
to the establishing of and maintaining the five Vedic fires (g<193>rhapatya, ç
<193>havan<200>ya, dak<218>in<193>gni, <193>vasthya and sabhya).
Similar to the four vy<220>has or emanations of the P<193><210>car<193>tra ç
system, the Vaikh<193>nasa system posits the caturm<220>rtis. Vi<218><207>u ç
is the °dim<220>rti. The four m<220>rtis or aspects are: Puru<218>a, ç
Satya, Acyuta and Aniruddha.
They also correspond to the four icons in the temple: Puru<218>a is ç
represented by the kautukabera, Satya by utsavabera, Acyuta by the ç
snapanabera and Aniruddha by the balibera. During the actual worship, ç
however, Aniruddha is omitted. The four images†kautaka, utsava, snapana ç
and bali†are taken to represent Vi<218><207>u, Puru<218>a, Satya and ç
Acyuta respectively.
In the temple worship of the Vaikh<193>-nasa system, these four aspects ç
of Vi<218><207>u are visualised as four forms located around him, ç
in the immediate enclosure: Puru<218>a to the east; Satya to the south; ç
Acyuta to the west; and Aniruddha to the north.

Iconographical works describe their images in different ways.
