A student becomes fit to study the Vedas only after the upanayana ç
ceremony.
At the time of teaching the Vedas, the teacher sits facing the east ç
and the student on his right, facing the north.
After <193>camana (ceremonial sipping of water) the student requests ç
the teacher and the teacher consents to start the teaching.
Detailed instructions have been given in the works known as ·ik<218><193> ç
(one of the six Ved<193><209>gas) as to the modes of sitting postures, ç
pronouncing methods, movement of hands and head and so on. For instance, ç
shaking of limbs, lengthening the words like in music and restlessness ç
have to be avoided.
If the mantras are chanted as per the prescribed methods, they will ç
definitely produce their effect.
@NT = Ved<193><209>gas
@N1KERN = (`limbs or subsidiaries of Vedas')
The Vedas are difficult to understand mainly due to two reasons: their ç
archaic language and their complicated ritual system.
Consequently, the six Ved<193><209>gas were evolved even from the ç
ancient times to make them intelligible and practicable.
Though the word `a<209>ga' literally means a limb, in a more technical ç
sense it signifies a subsidiary field of knowledge that helps us to ç
understand the main work. Hence, Ved<193><209>gas are subsidiary sciences ç
that help us to understand the Vedas.
The  six  Ved<193><209>gas  are:  <185>ik<218><193> (phonetics); Chandas ç
(prosody); Vy<193>kara<207>a (grammar); Nirukta (etymology); Jyauti<218>a ç
(astronomy) and Kalpa (religious practice).
See under each title for details.
@NT = Ved<193>nta Dar·ana
@SB8.5 = Preamble†S<220>tras
The system of education in ancient India required the students to ç
live in the campus of a forest academy along with the teachers. The ç
teaching imparted was, almost always, in theform of s<220>tras or ç
aphorisms, followed by explanations and discussions. At a time when ç
committing things  to  memory  was  considered supremelyimportant,thismethodsuited ç
admirably.
The s<220>tra literature is a class by itself. As per the norms set ç
for a s<220>tra, it should be `alp<193>k<218>ara' (consisting of minimum ç
number of letters), `asandigdha' (without doubt as regards the meaning), ç
`s<193>ravat' (must contain the essence of the subject) and yet, `vi·vatomukha' ç
(reflect all aspects of the same). However, in their anxiety to economise ç
the words, the composers of the s<220>tra-works seem to have so overdone ç
it that bh<193><218>yas or explanatory commentaries by later writers ç
became necessary.
The ·rauta, the g<216>hya and the dharma s<220>tras form the earliest ç
bunch of s<220>tra literature. The dar·anas or the philosophical systems ç
which are of a later period, followed this s<220>tra model since it ç
served their purpose well.
@SB8.5 = Ved<193>nta Dar·ana
Out of the six dar·anas or systems of philosophy which accept the ç
authority of the Vedas (the basic scriptures of Hinduism), the last ç
two†the M<200>m<193><221>s<193> and the Ved<193>nta systems†are directly ç
connected with them. Whereas the former tries to reconcile the various ç
Vedic texts that seem to give different directions with regard to ç
the same ritual system, the latter attempts to make out a coherent ç
philosophy of Brahman (God, the Absolute) from the apparently conflicting ç
statements in the Upani<218>ads.
@SB8.5 = Prasth<193>natraya
The Ved<193>nta system, as its very name implies, deals with the Upani<218>ads ç
which are the end-portions (anta = end) of the Vedas and also contain ç
the essence (anta = core or essence) of the same. The system itself ç
is based on three canonical works: the Upani<218>ads, the Brahmas<220>tras ç
(of B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a)Öand the Bhagavadg<200>t<193>. The Upani<218>ads ç
are called `·ruti-prasth<193>na,' the Brahmas<220>tras, `ny<193>ya-prasth<193>na' ç
and the Bhagavadg<200>t<193>, `sm<216>ti-prasth<193>na,' the three ç
together being termed `prasth<193>natraya'. `Prasth<193>na' means ç
a school of philosophy or religion.
@SB8.5 = The Upani<218>ads
Though a very large number of works going by the name `Upani<218>ad' ç
are available in print today, orthodox tradition accepts only a handful ç
of them†twelve to fourteen †as ancient and authoritative. The entire ç
edifice of the Ved<193>nta system of philosophy depends upon these ç
few Upani<218>ads.
The teachings of these Upani<218>ads may, broadly speaking, be classified ç
as follows: Brahman as the ultimate cause of this world; nature of ç
Brahman; evolution of this world and its character; nature of the ç
living beings as individual souls; their relationship with Brahman; ç
their involvement in this world as well as their transmigration; the ç
final goal of life; the disciplines that help in reaching that goal; ç
and, the nature of attainment of that final goal.
It is a fact that the Upani<218>ads, as extant today, do not give ç
a coherent picture of these various subjects discussed in them. Since ç
tradition and orthodoxy deem the entire body of the Upani<218>ads ç
as one canonical scripture†the <185>ruti†it became necessary to reinterpret ç
and reorganise their teachings so as to give them a more coherent ç
look. It was exactly this that B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a attempted and ç
the result was the Brahmas<220>tras.
@SB8.5 = The Brahmas<220>tras
The work derives its name from the fact that it deals chiefly with ç
Brahman (God, the Absolute) as described in the Upani<218>ads, in ç
all its aspects. It is also known by other names as follows:
a)
@NK = The Ved<193>nta-s<220>tras, since the subject matter is that ç
of Ved<193>nta or the Upani<218>ads;
b)
@NK = The <185><193>r<200>raka-s<220>tras, since the <193>tman living ç
in the ·ar<200>ra or the body is dealt with in the work;
c)
@NK = The Uttara-m<200>m<193><221>s<193>-s<220>tras (as opposed ç
to the P<220>rva-m<200>m<193><221>s<193>-s<220>tras) since it does ç
m<200>m<193><221>s<193> or enquiry into the uttara or latter part ç
of the Vedas;
d)
@NK = The Bhik<218>u-s<220>tras since it is specially recommended ç
for study by the bhik<218>us or the sa<221>ny<193>sins.
@SB8.5 = B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a, the Author
Nothing is known about B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a, the  author  of  this  celebrated  work. ç
Traditionalists identify him with Vy<193>sa, the author of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata ç
and the pur<193><207>as. The work is generally assigned to the period ç
500 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>†200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> by the Indian and some Western ç
scholars. However, there are other scholars who consider the two to ç
be different and assign B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a to the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
200.
@SPACE = 
@SB8.5 = About the Work
@SPACE = 
The work Brahmas<220>tras is in four adhy<193>yas or chapters. Each ç
adhy<193>ya is divided into four p<193>das or quarters. The p<193>das ç
comprise adhikara<207>as or topics, each composed of s<220>tras.
The total number of adhikara<207>as and thes<220>tras, according ç
to <185>a<209>kara (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 788-820), the earliest commentator, ç
is 191 and 555 respectively. However, variations are seen in this ç
number as also in the readings themselves. Splitting one s<220>tra ç
into two, fusing two s<220>tras into one or adding the last word of ç
a s<220>tra to the beginning of the next are some of the reasons for ç
such variations in the readings. Such alterations in the structure ç
of thes<220>tras have contributed to divergent interpretations also. ç
Not only that, divergent views have also arisen due to one school ç
considering a particular s<220>tra as stating the p<220>rvapak<218>a ç
(the prima facie view, the objection or doubt) and another school ç
accepting the same s<220>tra as the siddh<193>nta (the theory propounded ç
by the author of the work).
As already stated, each p<193>da of thevarious adhy<193>yas, comprises ç
several adhikara<207>as or topics. An adhikara<207>a must have five ç
parts connected in a graded manner. They are:
1) vi<218>aya or topic; 2) vi·aya or sa<221>·aya, doubt; 3) p<220>rvapak<218>a ç
or opponent's view; 4) siddh<193>nta or established conclusion and ç
5) sa<209>gati or connection between the different sections.
The number of s<220>tras in any adhikara<207>a depends on the nature ç
of the subject under discussion. Thanks to the ambiguity in the s<220>tras, ç
the titles and the number of the adhikara<207>as vary from commentator ç
to commentator.
While Nimb<193>rka (13th cent. <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) has the minimum number ç
of adhikara<207>as (151) Madhva (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1238-1317) has the ç
maximum (223).
The purport of the s<220>tra itself is determined by the commentators ç
as per the principle of <218>a<195>vidhali<209>gas or six characteristic ç
signs. They are: upakrama and upasa<221>h<193>ra (the beginning and ç
theend), abhy<193>sa (repetition), ap<220>rvat<193> (novelty),  phala  (objective),  arthav<193>da ç
(eulogy) and upapatti (logicality).
@SPACE1 = 
True to its name, the work Brahma-s<220>tras deals primarily with ç
Brahman as the highest truth, the only independent truth,  by  realising  which,  a  person ç
transcends transmigratory existence. The one and only authority for ç
the existence of Brahman as also for its true nature is the <185>ruti, ç
the J<210><193>nak<193><207><195>a part (section dealing with the ç
knowledge of Brahman/ °tman) of the Vedas comprising the Upani<218>ads. ç
This knowledge of Brahman can never be obtained by logic and reasoning ç
which depend upon the puny human  intellect.  Since  the  intellect ç
depends upon the knowledge gained by the senses and since Brahman, ç
the pure consciousness that he is, is beyond theken of the senses, ç
the <185>ruti as revealedto the <216><218>is is the only source for ç
knowinghim.
This takes us to the next point†the various Upani<218>adic statements ç
that form the basis for the philosophy of the Brahma-s<220>tras. ç
Since some of these statements appeared to contradict one another, ç
B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a  had  to  undertake  the unenviable task of ç
collating them to weave out a homogeneous philosophy. While doing ç
it, he naturally chose the most ancient of the Upani<218>ads. Which ç
are those Upani<218>ads, the statements of which, B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a ç
has discussed in these s<220>tras? There is no direct indication in ç
the s<220>tras themselves since they are too laconic. For this we ç
have to depend almost entirely on the bh<193><218>yak<193>ras or the ç
commentators who, fortunately for us, are more or less unanimous in ç
deciphering the same.
In the first 31 adhikara<207>as (as per <185>a<209>kara) the major ç
statements that form the vi<218>aya or vi<218>ayav<193>kya (subject-matter) ç
are from the following Upani<218>ads, with the number of such sentences ç
noted against them:
Ch<193>ndogya (14), B<216>had<193>ra<207>yaka (5), Ka<219>ha ç
(4), Taittir<200>ya (2), Mu<207><195>aka (3), Pra·na (1) and ç
Kau<218><200>taki (2).
Apart from these, sentences taken from the <185>vet<193>·vatara, ç
the Aitareya and the J<193>b<193>la Upani<218>ads have also been ç
discussed.
@SPACE1 = 
While analysing the purport of the various passages from the Upani<218>ads, ç
B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a has quoted the opinions of other teachers also. ç
They are: °treya, °·marathya, Au<195>ulomi, K<193>r<218><207><193>jani, ç
K<193>·ak<216>tsna, Jaimini and B<193>dari. Almost all these names ç
appear in the earlier works like the ·rautas<220>tras and the g<216>hyas<220>tras. ç
It is likely that some preceded B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a and others ç
like Jaimini might have been his contemporaries. Though he differed ç
from them, he has not criticised their views, probably because they ç
were also Ved<193>ntins of repute, whohad accepted theUpani<218>ads ç
as the primary authority and Brahman as the highest truth.
@SB8.5 = A Brief Synopsis
The contents of the work may now be summarised as follows:
@S10 = First Chapter
The First chapter comprising 134 s<220>tras in 39 adhikara<207>as ç
has been called Samanvay<193>dhy<193>ya, since it attempts to harmonise ç
(samanvaya = harmony) the principles dealt with in the various Upani<218>ads.
The work starts with the famous s<220>tra ath<193>to brahmajij<210><193>s<193> ç
(`Now, therefore, the desire to know Brahman'). Since the knowledge ç
or experience of Brahman leads to mok<218>a or freedom from transmigration, ç
it is very necessary to have a correct understanding of Brahman. Keeping ç
this in view, the treatise deals with the various statements in the ç
well-known Upani<218>ads concerning Brahman. Brahman is he from whom ç
this world came into existence, in whom it inheres and to whom it ç
returns at the end of a cycle of creation. The only source for the ç
knowledge of this Brahman is the <185>ruti or the Upani<218>ads.
It is Brahman alone who is the ultimate cause of this world and not ç
prak<216>ti or pradh<193>na as the S<193><209>khyas aver, since it ç
is insentient. An insentient cause can never think or will and produce ç
such a perfectly designed universe.
This Brahman is <193>nandamaya, full of bliss. He is transcendent ç
as well as immanent in this world, including the j<200>v<193>tmas ç
or the individual souls. The being of light that exists in <193>ditya ç
or the sun and our own eyes is also Brahman. He is also designated ç
as <193>k<193>·a, pr<193><207>a, bh<220>m<193> and ak<218>ara. The ç
being described as `a<209>gu<218><219>ham<193>tra-puru<218>a' (the ç
person of the size of the thumb) is also really Brahman and not the ç
j<200>va, or the individual soul. So also does the word °tman refer ç
to him.
B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a quotes the opinions of °·marathya,  Au<195>ulomi  and  K<193>·ak<216>tsna ç
in  the  fourth  p<193>da  of  this  chapter. °·marathya thinks that ç
the j<200>v<193>tmas areboth different and non-different from Brahman ç
(or Param<193>tman) even as the sparks of fire are both identical ç
with and different from fire. Au<195>ulomi opines that the j<200>vas ç
are different from Brahman in the state of bondage but become one ç
with him in the state of liberation. K<193>·ak<216>tsna, however, ç
considers the two to be identical, since it is Brahman that has become ç
the j<200>va also.
Though the views of these teachers are stated, B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a ç
does not give his own opinion or preference.
The last part of this chapter asserts that Brahman is both the up<193>d<193>nak<193>ra<207>a ç
(material cause) and the nimittak<193>ra<207>a (efficient cause) of ç
this world.
@S10 = Second Chapter
Designated as Avirodh<193>dhy<193>ya, this chapter with 157 s<220>tras ç
distributed among 47 adhikara<207>as applies itself to dispel any ç
virodha or contradiction that may confront this philosophy of Ved<193>nta.
Ved<193>nta is not opposed to sm<216>ti (secondary scriptures like ç
the Bhagavad-g<200>t<193> and °pastamba Dharmas<220>tras) and ç
tarka (logic and reasoning). The opposition of schools like that of ç
the S<193><209>khya is fallible. There is no contradiction among the ç
various statements in the Upani<218>ads dealing with subjects like ç
creation. This is the burden of the teaching of this chapter.
@SPACE1 = 
Out of the several non-Ved<193>ntic systems of philosophy that existed ç
during B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a's time, the S<193><209>khya system was ç
the most powerful. Hence it has been given special attention while ç
refuting the other schools.
One  of  the  important  factors discussed here is the relationship ç
between the k<193>ra<207>a (the cause) and the k<193>rya (the effect). ç
The S<193><209>khyan view known as `sat-k<193>rya-v<193>da' states ç
that the k<193>rya or the effect pre-exists (sat<|>=<|>existing) in ç
the k<193>ra<207>a or cause. In the process of creation it just gets ç
manifested and is not newly produced, since something real can never ç
be produced from the unreal. On the other hand the Vai·e<218>ika school ç
accepts the `asat-k<193>rya-v<193>da,' according to which the previously ç
non-existent (= asat) effect is newly produced. In the former case, ç
the effect pre-exists in the up<193>d<193>na-k<193>ra<207>a (the material ç
cause) and in the latter, the nimitta-k<193>ra<207>a (the efficient ç
cause) is constant. B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a accepts these views partially ç
and declares, on the basis of the Upani<218>ads, that Brahman is `abhinna-nimitta-up<193>d<193>na-k<193>ra<207>a,' ç
both the material and the efficient cause of this world. Hence this ç
world is non-different from Brahman. The objection that this world ç
consists of insentient objects and hence cannot be the product of ç
the sentient Brahman does not hold good, since the <185>ruti,  the  highest  authority  in  such ç
matters which are beyond the powers of the ordinary human intellect, ç
declares it to be so.
Brahman has no selfish motive in creating this world, since he is ç
self- contented. There is neither partiality nor cruelty in this creation ç
since justice is meted out to the j<200>vas according to their karmas ç
or deserts. The very purpose of creation of this world is to help ç
the j<200>vas to attain <193>nanda or bliss by getting established  in  Brahman,  the  Bliss- ç
Absolute.
Apart from the S<193><209>khya school, the otherschools like those ç
of the Vai·e<218>ikas, the Buddhists, the Jainas, the P<193>·upatas ç
and the Bh<193>gavatas like the P<193><210>car<193>tras have also ç
been critically examined and dismissed.
@S10 = Third Chapter
The third chapter is called S<193>dhan<193>dhy<193>ya and is the ç
longest, with 186 s<220>tras spread over 67 adhikara<207>as. Though ç
called thus, the topics discussed are diverse. They are: transmigration ç
of the j<200>va into other bodies; dream-creations of the j<200>va; ç
its experiencing the deserts of karma by the will of ®·vara or God; ç
various vidy<193>s or meditations mentioned in the Upani<218>ads and ç
clarifications regarding them; collating of a vidy<193> when described ç
differently in different Upani<218>ads; know-ledge of the °tman or ç
Brahman as independent of karmas or rituals; certain clarifications ç
regarding the rituals and duties prescribed for the various <193>·ramas ç
(stages of life like brahmacarya or sa<221>ny<193>sa) as also pr<193>ya·cittas ç
(expiations) and so on.
@S10 = Fourth Chapter
@EMERGENCY = Known as Phal<193>dhy<193>ya this chapter is the shortest ç
with only 78 s<220>tras and 38 adhikara<207>as. The main topic discussed ç
is the journey of the j<200>va after death to Brahmaloka by the `arcir<193>dim<193>rga' ç
or `devay<193>na', the path of light or of gods.
One who is interested in mok<218>a or liberation has to practise ·rava<207>a ç
(listening to the scriptures describing the nature of °tman/Brahman) ç
and allied disciplines until realisation. The various up<193>san<193>s ç
or meditations described in the Upani<218>ads aid the j<200>va in ç
the process of attaining mok<218>a. On attaining brahmaj<210><193>na ç
or knowledge of Brahman, sa<210>cita-karma (karma accumulated over ç
several lives) gets destroyed. °g<193>m<200>-karma, karma done after ç
realisation, is rendered fruitless. The pr<193>rabdha-karma, the karma ç
that has already started this body and is yielding results has to ç
be exhausted only by experiencing it.
The j<200>vas who have practised severe spiritual disciplines like ç
tapas (austerity), ·raddh<193> (devoted faith) and brahmacarya (celibacy), ç
as also vidy<193>s like meditation on Brahman will travel, after death, ç
by the arcir<193>dim<193>rga or the path of light comprising light, ç
day, bright-fortnight and so on, and reach the Brahmaloka from which ç
there is no return. There are divine guides called `<193>tiv<193>hikas' ç
who take the j<200>va through the various stations of light to the ç
Brahmaloka.
Anomalies in the descriptions concerning the details of the arcir<193>dim<193>rga ç
have been set right through proper interpretations and arguments.
The work ends with the declaration, an<193>v<216>tti<199>  ·abd<193>t,  repeated  twice  for ç
emphasis, (`There is no return, since the scriptures declare so'.) ç
meaning that the j<200>va reaching the Brahmaloka will not return ç
to this mundane existence. Descriptions of the nature of the muktapuru<218>a, ç
the liberated soul, are given at the appropriate places. The views ç
of Jaimini, Au<195>ulomi and B<193>dari in this regard have also been ç
cited.
@SB8.5 = The Philosophy of B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a
B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a wrote the Brahmas<220>tras to systematise ç
the teachings of the Upani<218>ads into a coherent philosophy. However, ç
since the s<220>tras are short and terse, it becomes quite a job to ç
find out what exactly is his own philosophy as revealed through this ç
work. Even so, with the help of the s<220>tras which seem to be more ç
unambiguous than the others, an attempt may now be made to portray ç
the same.
The one and only pram<193><207>a (source of knowledge) that B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a ç
accepts while expounding the Ved<193>nta system is the <185>ruti or ç
the Vedas, especially the J<210><193>nak<193><207><195>a part of ç
it, viz., the Upani<218>ads. He considers the words of the Vedas as ç
nitya or eternal. Logic and reasoning, which can always be unsettled ç
by superior ones, can never be relied upon in determining the transcendental ç
truths like the ultimate cause of the world. Sm<216>tis or secondary ç
scriptures like the Manusm<216>ti and  the  Mah<193>bh<193>rata  including  the ç
Bhagavadg<200>t<193> can also be depended upon insofar as they do ç
not contradict the <185>ruti.
The <185>ruti declares Brahman as the origin of this universe, the ç
primary, nay, the only truth. In fact, the very definition (janm<193>dyasya ç
yata<199>, 1.1.2) makes him the uncaused cause, the ground of sustenance ç
and involution of the world. He is both the material and the efficient ç
cause of the world. He needs no external implements or assistance ç
and can transform himself even as milk is transformed into its products.
He evolves himself into <193>k<193>·a (ether), v<193>yu (air) and ç
other products by willing the same; and, he is associated with every ç
stage of creation up to the last.
Since it is Brahman that has evolved into this world, this world is ç
non-different from him, even as an unfolded cloth is non-different ç
from the same which was earlier folded.
The activity of creation is a l<200>l<193> or effortless sport for ç
Brahman. But, since it is done as per the karmas of the unredeemed ç
j<200>vas, one should not attribute partiality or cruelty to him, ç
seeing the good and evil that exist here.
As regards the j<200>va or the individual soul, B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a ç
defines him as a `j<210>a'or knower, a being endowed with consciousness. ç
He has no birth or death. He is eternal and atomic in size. Whether ç
the j<200>va is an a<221>·a (part) of Brahman or his <193>bh<193>sa ç
(reflection) has not been stated clearly though the views of other ç
Ved<193>ntins like °·marathya, Au<195>ulomi and K<193>·ak<216>tsna ç
have been given.
The relationship between the j<200>va and Brahman has been likened ç
to the snake and its coiled-up state, or light and its source. Thus ç
the question whether they are different or identical has been left ç
unanswered.
@SPACE1 = 
By meditation on °tman/Brahman leading to j<210><193>na, or experience ç
of the same, the j<200>va attains liberation. The <185>rutis give ç
equal importance to the performance of karma or prescribed actions ç
and ty<193>ga or renunciation of the same,though the performance ç
of duties prescribed for the respective <193>·ramas (stages of life) ç
has been stressed even for the spiritual aspirant. The fruits of the ç
various up<193>san<193>s or meditations practised by a j<200>va accrue ç
to him by the grace of ®·vara (Brahman as the ruler of the created ç
world).
On attaining the knowledge of Brahman, all the sa<210>cita-karma (accumulated ç
past karma) of the j<200>va will be destroyed. He will live as long ç
as the pr<193>rabdha-karma (karma already fructified) lasts. But, ç
the karma done after attaining knowledge will not affect him.
The j<200>va who has reached the acme of meditation while living, ç
will, after death, travel by the arcir<193>dim<193>rga or devay<193>na ç
(the path of light or of the gods) and reach Brahmaloka from which ç
there is no return to this world. There, he will be one with Brahman, ç
non-different fromhim. The various attributes predicated of Brahman ç
get manifested in the liberated j<200>va. Caitanya or consciousness ç
being his essential nature, is of course, always there.
In conclusion it can be affirmed that B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a, in these ç
s<220>tras, teaches a kind of advaita (Brahm<193>dvaita?). He does ç
not admit the existence of either the j<200>vas or the world as independent ç
of, or different from, Brahman. Since he has accepted the Upani<218>ads ç
as the supreme authority and since the other teachers like B<193>dari ç
whom he has quoted, also did the same, he has not contradicted them. ç
Both the views †that Brahman is nirvi·e<218>a-cinm<193>tra-svar<220>pa ç
(pure consciousness without any attributes) and savi·e<218>a (with ç
attributes)† seem to be acceptable to him. Obviously he has tried ç
to reconcile the various, apparently conflicting, views expressed ç
in the Upani<218>ads and explain them rather than formulate his ç
own philosophy.
@SB8.5 = The Commentators and Their Works
The Vedas have been the foundation of Hindu religion and culture for ç
millennia. The philosophy of Ved<193>nta based on theUpani<218>ads ç
has held sway over the intelligentsia for centuries. Hence, it is ç
but natural that the Brahmas<220>tras of B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a ç
has attracted the attention of the distinguished scholars over the ç
years, who have enriched the Ved<193>nta literature by their brilliant ç
expositions. All these commentators have evinced great respect for ç
B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a and his monumental work. They have tried to ç
critically examine all the other schools that were important during ç
their days and to prove the superiority of Ved<193>nta over them. ç
Of course, they were equally keen to establish their own school of ç
Ved<193>nta also.
Of the several bh<193><218>yas or commentaries available to us today, ç
that of <185>a<209>kara is the earliest. There might have been quite ç
a few bh<193><218>yas composed by the earlier writers. It can however ç
be stated with certainty that Upavar<218>a, to whom <185>a<209>kara ç
refers in his commentary (1.3.28; 3.3.53) must have been one such. ç
Bodh<193>yana, another commentator, referred to as `V<216>ttik<193>ra' ç
by R<193>m<193>nuja, is sometimes identified with this Upavar<218>a ç
though there is no unanimity regarding it.
The following list of commentators who have left bh<193><218>yas directly ç
on the Brahmas<220>tras  may  be  useful  to  the students of Ved<193>nta ç

A brief summary of the more important of these schools may now be ç
given. Since the schools propounded by <185>a<209>kara, R<193>m<193>nuja ç
and Madhva are more well-known and gained precedence over the other, ç
they will be taken up first.
@S8ITAL = <185>A<177>KARA
<185>a<209>kara's dar·ana or philosophy as revealed in his bh<193><218>yas ç
on the Bhagavad-g<200>t<193>, the ten ancient Upani<218>ads and ç
theBrahmas<220>tras is now well-known as Advaita  Ved<193>nta.  The  oft-quoted  and ç
famous verse `brahma satya<221> jagan mithy<193>  j<200>vo  brahmaiva  n<193>para<199>' ç
(`Brahman alone is real; this world is only an illusory appearance. ç
The j<200>va is verily Brahman and is not different from him.') gives ç
this philosophy in a nutshell.
<185>a<209>kara categorises Brahman into two aspects: Para-brahman ç
and Apara-brahman. Where the Upani<218>adic statements deny all limiting ç
adjuncts to Brahman like name and form, created by avidy<193> or ignorance ç
of his essential nature, he is Para, the higher, Brahman. On theother ç
hand, where these statements describe him as endowed with name, form ç
and several attributes, it is the Apara or the lower Brahman that ç
is referred to. It is the latter that is the cause for the creation ç
of this world, its sustenance and its dissolution.
Really speaking, Brahman does not get transformed into this world. ç
The multiplicity of names and forms is only a `vivarta,' an appearance, ç
due to avidy<193> or ignorance, even as a snake is perceived in a ç
rope in insufficient light. This he calls as `adhy<193>sa' or `adhy<193>ropa' ç
(superimposition). Through vidy<193> or discriminative knowledge, ç
`apav<193>da' or desuper-<~>imposition takes place, giving the true ç
knowledge of the reality.
<185>a<209>kara  considers  the  j<200>vas  as caitanya  or  pure  ç
consciousness,  but, circumscribed by theanta<199>kara<207>a (the ç
`inner organ' or mind). The j<200>va, though nitya (eternal), ·uddha ç
(pure), buddha (awakened), and mukta (free), appears as kart<193> ç
(the doer) and bhokt<193> (the experiencer) due to the limitation ç
imposed by the anta<199>kara<207>a.
The Upani<218>adic sentences like `tat tvam asi' teach the essential ç
identity between the j<200>va and Brahman, as pure consciousness,  after  eliminating  their ç
adventitious qualities.
@SPACE1 = 
<185>a<209>kara does accept kramamukti or gradual liberation of the ç
j<200>va after death, by travelling through the devay<193>na, to Brahmaloka, ç
as described in the Upa-ni<218>ads and the Brahmas<220>tras. However, ç
he is emphatic about sadyomukti or instant liberation, here and now, ç
simultaneously with the rising of j<210><193>na or knowledge. Such ç
a mukti is also called j<200>vanmukti, liberation even while living.
@S8ITAL = R°M°NUJA
R<193>m<193>nuja's  commentary  on  the Brahmas<220>tras is known ç
as <185>r<200>bh<193><218>ya. Apart from this, he has also composed ç
two more smaller works on the Brahma-s<220>tras, the Ved<193>ntad<200>pa ç
and the Ved<193>nta-s<193>ra. The former, being a later work, contains ç
some additional explanations.
R<193>m<193>nuja's <185>r<200>bh<193><218>ya is stated to follow ç
in the footsteps of the more detailed Bodh<193>yanav<216>tti as ç
also the works of some earlier Ved<193>ntins like Brahmanand<200> ç
and Drami<195><193>c<193>rya whose works are not available now.
R<193>m<193>nuja accepts Brahman as the highest and independent reality. ç
However Brahman includes in himself cit (the sentient beings, the ç
j<200>vas) and acit (the insentient prak<216>ti or nature). These ç
two are also real, but under the absolute control of Brahman. Brahman†also ç
called ®·vara by him†includes them, is immanent in then and also transcends ç
them. Hence, R<193>m<193>nuja's system is called `Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita,' ç
advaita or non-duality of Brahman, the Absolute, but `vi·i<218><219>a' ç
or qualified by cit and acit. It is similar to a tree with branches, ç
leaves and fruits. Though the tree is `one,' it has internal parts, ç
each part being different from the other parts, the tree itself, however, ç
always remaining as one.
To  R<193>m<193>nuja,  Brahman  is  the Supreme Person (sarve·vara) ç
who is the ruler of all. He is antagonistic to all evil. He possesses ç
infinite auspicious qualities. He is omniscient and omnipotent. The ç
creation, subsistence and re-absorption of this world proceed from ç
him.
R<193>m<193>nuja considers the j<200>va or the individual soul as ç
the spirit different from the body, atomic in size and endowed with ç
j<210><193>na or consciousness which contracts or expands. He has ç
a free will. And, the j<200>vas are infinite in number. Some j<200>vas ç
called `nityas' are ever free. Others who are now `baddha' or bound, ç
can attain mukti through bhakti and prapatti (devotion and surrender) ç
and the grace of God. All the liberated j<200>vas are similar in nature.
Spiritual life starts with the performance of the prescribed karmas ç
in the right spirit leading to the purification of the mind. Such ç
a pure j<200>va becomes fit to practise j<210><193>na and experience ç
his separateness from the body-mind complex. However, it is through ç
bhakti and prapatti that he ultimately attains Brahman through the ç
devay<193>na and becomes free.
@S8ITAL = MADHVA
A thorough-going dualist, Madhva has composed 37 works which collectively ç
go by the name Sarvam<220>la. The short and terse bh<193><218>ya ç
on the Brahmas<220>tras, the A<207>ubh<193><218>ya a brief treatise ç
on the same in verses, Ny<193>yavivara<207>a and the Anuvy<193>khy<193>na ç
are the four works on the s<220>traprasth<193>na. His is a philosophy ç
of realism  and  a  monotheistic  theology centering on devotion to ç
Vi<218><207>u or N<193>r<193>ya<207>a.
According to him Brahman, identified with Vi<218><207>u (N<193>r<193>ya<207>a) ç
is the independent reality. Prak<216>ti or matter, and the j<200>vas ç
or souls who are atomic and infinite in number, are coeval realities ç
but entirely dependent on him. Brahman is essentially knowledge and ç
bliss. Though his infinite personality is beyond our conception, out ç
of grace for us, he can take forms which are neither material nor ç
finite.
Madhva proclaims the theory of pa<210>cabhedas or five eternal differences ç
between Brahman and the j<200>vas, Brahman and prak<216>ti, j<200>vas ç
and prak<216>ti, j<200>va and j<200>va, and various objects of prak<216>ti.
He categorises the j<200>vas into three groups: muktiyogyas, nityasa<221>s<193>rins ç
and tamoyogyas. The first group is capable of attaining mukti or liberation. ç
The second group, being interested only in the crass pleasure of the ç
world and not a whit in moral regeneration or spiritual elevation, ç
eternally goes through the rounds of births and deaths. The third ç
group of j<200>vas, the damned sinners that they are, degenerates ç
into lower births and suffers in hell.
The j<200>vas get liberation through bhakti and the grace of God. ç
In the state of liberation they are not only freed from suffering ç
but also enjoy positive bliss. Differences among the j<200>vas, however, ç
persist even in the state of liberation.
@S8ITAL = BH°SKARA
Bh<193>skara is the trail-blazer for the post-<185>a<209>kara schools ç
of Ved<193>nta which did not agree with <185>a<209>kara's brand of ç
advaita based on m<193>y<193>v<193>da, the theory of the unreality ç
of this world. He is a strict Ved<193>ntin in the sense that he takes ç
his stand based on the Upani<218>ads and the Brahmas<220>tras. His ç
commentary on the latter expounds his philosophy.
Bh<193>skara advocates the acceptance of the direct meaning of all ç
the passages of the Upani<218>ads without any distinction. He presents ç
a Brahman who has innumer- able auspicious attributes, but, without ç
any particular form. Hehas a twofold power†the bhokt<216>·akti (the ç
power of the enjoyer) and the bhogya·akti (the power of the enjoyed). ç
Using these two powers Brahman transforms himself into the acetana ç
or insentient objects and the j<200>vas or the sentient souls. Though ç
this transformation is real, it does not affect him in any way. The ç
j<200>vas in their essential nature are one with Brahman, but get ç
differentiated from him in the state of bondage due to the up<193>dhis, ç
or limiting adjuncts†the bodies and minds†which are real. These up<193>dhis, ç
though real, are not nitya or eternal. They are to be considered real ç
since they are actually experienced. But, in the state of liberation, ç
they become one with Brahman even as the rivers flowing into the ocean ç
become one with it.
Bh<193>skara considers this world as the k<193>ryar<220>pa or effect ç
of Brahman and hence real.
As regards the s<193>dhana, Bh<193>skara recommends  performance  of  scripture- ç
ordained duties without any desire for their fruits, and the practice ç
of meditation on Brahman as also the j<200>va's oneness with him. ç
Since he does not accept a Personal God, there is no place for divine ç
grace in his system.
@S8ITAL = NIMB°RKA
Nimb<193>rka's Dvait<193>dvaita is very similar to the Bhed<193>bheda ç
of Bh<193>skara. However, being a firm believer in Brahman with form ç
and attributes and the path of devotion, his philosophy is more akin ç
to that of R<193>m<193>nuja.
Nimb<193>rka's<|><|>main<|><|>work is <|>Ved<193>nta-p<193>rij<193>ta-saurabha ç
which is his commentary on the Brahmas<220>tras. It is rather brief ç
but lucid, since he avoids the dialectical methods or a flowery style.
According to him there are three equally real and co-eternal tattvas ç
or principles: Brahman, cit and acit. While Brahman is the controller ç
or niyant<216>, cit (the sentient being, the j<200>va or the soul) ç
is the enjoyer, bhokt<216>, and acit (the insentient nature, prak<216>ti) ç
is the enjoyed, bhogya.
Acit is of three kinds: pr<193>k<216>ta or what is derived from prak<216>ti ç
or primal matter; apr<193>k<216>ta or what is not derived from prak<216>ti, ç
but derived from a non-material substance of which the world of Brahman ç
is made and, k<193>la or time.
They are different from one another in their svar<220>pa or nature. ç
But the citand the acit are paratantra-tattvas, dependent realities.
Nimb<193>rka adopts the view that the bheda (difference) and the abheda ç
(non-difference) are both equally real. They coexist but do not contradict ç
each other. It is something like the relationship between the sea ç
and its waves or the sun and its rays. Cit and acit, the souls and ç
the universe, exist in Brahman from all eternity and never get separated ç
from him, whether in the causal state or when manifested.
@SPACE1 = 
They retain their individuality even during salvation, or dissolution ç
of the universe.
Brahman is personal, possesses a celestial body, and is full of exquisite ç
beauty and grace. Nimb<193>rka identifies him with K<216><218><207>a ç
and posits R<193>dh<193> as his <185>akti or consort even as R<193>m<193>nuja ç
accepts Lak<218>m<200> as the consort of Vi<218><207>u-N<193>r<193>ya<207>a.
Brahman is omniscient, the cause of the origin, sustenance and destruction ç
of the universe. He is all-powerful and yet all- merciful. He is gracious ç
to his devotees and helps them have a direct vision of himself.
The j<200>vas are atomic and infinite in number. Each of them is a ç
distinctive agent, a j<210>at<216> (knower), kart<216> (doer) and ç
bhokt<216> (enjoyer) of the karmas he does. They animate the body ç
they live in, even as a small lamp kept in a room lights up the whole ç
room.
There are three destinies for the j<200>vas†naraka or hell for the ç
sinners, svarga or heaven for the virtuous and apavarga or release ç
for the enlightened ones. Apavarga is attaining the world of Brahman ç
from which there is no return.
Constant meditation on Brahman as the inmost self of the j<200>va ç
or the individual soul is the means of attaining Brahman in Brahmaloka. ç
There he has brahma-svar<220>pa-l<193>bha, becomes similar to him ç
in nature, except for the power of creation.
The other s<193>dhanas recommended are: scripture-ordained work, knowledge, ç
devotion and surrender to God, as also strict obedience to the spiritual ç
teacher.
@SPACE = 
@S8ITAL = VALLABHA
@SPACE = 
Vallabha's philosophy is known as <185>uddh<193>dvaita. He is said ç
to have written two commentaries on the Brahmas<220>tras, the B<216>hadbh<193><218>ya ç
and the A<207>ubh<193><218>ya, of which the former is not available ç
now. The latter is up to the 33rd s<220>tra of the second p<193>da ç
of the third adhy<193>ya (3.2.33) only. The book was completed by ç
his son Vi<219><219>halan<193>tha. Apart from the prasth<193>natraya, ç
he holds the Bh<193>gavata in very high esteem. He wrote a commentary ç
onit also, called Subodhin<200>, which too remained incomplete.
For Vallabha, God the Absolute is K<216><218><207>a whom the Upani<218>ads ç
call `Brahman'. He is one without a second and is sat-cit-<193>nanda, ç
(being, awareness and bliss). He has three forms: Parabrahman, Puru<218>ottama ç
or K<216><218><207>a; Antary<193>min, the indwelling spirit of all ç
the living beings, and Ak<218>arabrahman which is the object of meditation ç
and the abode of K<216><218><207>a. It is this Ak<218>ara that appears ç
as prak<216>ti (insentient nature, the matrix of all created objects) ç
and puru<218>a (sentient soul, the j<200>va), but is beyond both. ç
While Puru<218>ottama is the highest, Ak<218>ara is an expression ç
of his.
This Ak<218>ara, again, appears in three more forms: k<193>la (time), ç
karma (action) and svabh<193>va (nature).
K<193>la or time is suprasensible and is inferred from its effects. ç
It is all-pervasive and the support of all beings. Karma or action ç
is also universal. It manifests itself as different actions of different ç
beings. Svabh<193>va or nature is that which produces pari<207><193>ma ç
or change.
@SPACE1 = 
God is both sagu<207>a and nirgu<207>a (with and without attributes). ç
He cannot be known except through his own grace. Through his m<193>y<193>·akti, ç
he can become anything at any time. He is both the material and the ç
efficient cause of this world. He creates the world through his own ç
nature and hence the samav<193>yi-k<193>ra<207>a, the inherent cause. ç
Though he exists everywhere in his tripartite nature as being, consciousness ç
and bliss, their manifestation in the created universe differs. Matter ç
reflects only the being aspect (`sat'), the souls reflect the consciousness ç
aspect also (`cit') whereas as Brahman, he manifests all the three ç
fully.
Though unmanifest and transcendent in his own nature, by creating ç
the world through his will, he becomes manifest and an object of comprehension. ç
Since this world is a manifestation of Brahman, it is never destroyed ç
but is only withdrawn into him at his will.
The j<200>vas or individual souls come out of Ak<218>ara-Brahman like ç
sparks from fire. They are eternal parts of Brahman and are atomic ç
in size. They are of three classes: pu<218><219>i, mary<193>d<193> ç
and prav<193>ha. The first are the chosen ones enjoying the grace ç
of God, and ardently devoted to him. The second study the scriptures, ç
perform the rites prescribed as ordained duties and also cultivate ç
devotion. They attain God in course of time. The last are interested ç
only in the worldly life and hence transmigrate constantly. Some of ç
them, due to satsa<209>ga or good company, may attain God later.
Vallabha considers bhakti or devotion as the only means of salvation. ç
By that, the j<200>va is released from the cycle of birth and death ç
and enjoys the bliss of God in all possible ways.
@SPACE1 = 
Vallabha holds that the knower of Brahman is absorbed in Ak<218>ara-Brahman ç
and not in Puru<218>ottama. It is only through bhakti that the latter, ç
the highest aspect, can be attained.
He advocates two forms of bhakti: mary<193>d<193>-bhakti  and  pu<218><219>i-bhakti.  The ç
former is formal devotion to be practised as described in the scriptures ç
and has to be cultivated by self-effort. The latter is attained by ç
the grace of God alone,without one's effort. `Pu<218><219>i' refers, ç
not to the physical nourishment, but to the spiritual nourishment ç
got by the grace of God. Hence the name `Pu<218><219>i-bhakti'. Consequently, ç
Vallabha's system is also called `Pu<218><219>i-m<193>rga'. Emphasis ç
on the worship of B<193>lak<216><218><207>a, (child K<216><218><207>a) ç
and sev<193> or service to him, find an important place in the mode ç
of s<193>dhana taught by him.
@S8ITAL = BALADEVA
Baladeva is an important teacher of the Bengal school of Vai<218><207>avism ç
developed by <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a Caitanya (<MS>A. D.<D> 1485-1533). ç
The philosophy of this school is known as Acintya-bhed<193>bheda. ç
Govindabh<193><218>ya is his commentary on the Brahmas<220>tras, ç
Siddh<193>ntaratna being another work that expounds this philosophy. ç
This school, though deeply indebted to the Dvaita system of Madhva, ç
also differs from it.
According to this school of thought, Brahman the highest reality is ç
K<216><218><207>a, Vi<218><207>u or Hari. He is the Personal God possessing ç
infinite auspicious qualities, which are `acintya' or beyond our comprehension. ç
He is `nirgu<207>a' only in the sense that he is beyond the three ç
gu<207>as of sattva, rajas and tamas. The scriptures are the only ç
authority to reveal him.
God has three powers: par<193>·akti (higher power), apar<193>·akti ç
(lower power) and avidy<193>·akti (nescience-power). Through the first, ç
he becomes the efficient cause, and, through the other two, the material ç
cause. When the latter two powers are manifested in gross forms, the ç
universe of souls and matter arises.
Creation of the world is a spontaneous act of the Lord. However, he ç
does it as per the karmas of the individual souls.
The individual soul is eternal. It is both knowledge and knower, an ç
enjoyer and an active agent, though not independent. It is atomic ç
in size.
Bhakti is the sole and direct cause of salvation. Though dhy<193>na ç
or up<193>san<193> (meditation) is one form of bhakti, it is through ç
prem<193>bhakti (intense devotion) that God can be realised. Performance ç
of duties purifies the mind. Study of the scriptures is an aid in ç
the path of s<193>dhana. However, it is ultimately by the grace of ç
God alone that he can be realised and salvation attained. The freed ç
soul resides in the same world as the lord and in his proximity, and ç
attains his nature and attributes. However, it retains its separate ç
identity.
Baladeva does not accept of j<200>vanmukti or liberation while living ç
in the body here.
@SB8.5 = The Brahmas<220>tra Literature
Being the basic text of Ved<193>nta, both in its metaphysical and ç
in its dialectical aspect, the Brahmas<220>tras has attracted the ç
attention of a host of elite scholars over the centuries. Apart from ç
the direct bh<193><218>yas by the great <193>c<193>ryas, several subcommentaries ç
and glosses over them have enriched the Brahmas<220>tra literature. ç
In such literature now available to us, the maximum number of works ç
belong to the Advaita school.
On the <185><193><209>karabh<193><218>ya, three <219><200>k<193>s ç
or subcommentaries are available in full: Bh<193>mat<200> of V<193>caspatimi·ra ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 840), Ny<193>yanir<207>aya of °nandagiri (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1260) and Ratnaprabh<193> of R<193>m<193>nanda (17thcentury)
The one by Padmap<193>da (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 820), a direct disciple of ç
<185>a<209>kara, called Pa<210>ca-p<193>dik<193> deals with the ç
first four s<220>tras (1.1.1-4) only. This was commented upon by Prak<193>·<193>tman ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1200) in his Pa<210>cap<193>dik<193>-vivara<207>am. ç
There is a gloss on this called Tattvad<200>panam by Akha<207><195><193>-nanda ç
Muni (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1350). All these commentaries collectively, have ç
created the Vivara<207>a-prasth<193>na, a special school of Advaita ç
Ved<193>nta, in the post-<185>a<209>kara period.
As opposed to this, the Bh<193>mat<200>-prasth<193>na was developed ç
by Amal<193>nanda (13th cent. <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) in his Kalpataru on ç
the Bh<193>mat<200> and Appayya-d<200>k<218>ita (16th cent. <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) ç
in his Parimal<193>, on this Kalpataru.
Mention may also be made of a fewother works on the Brahmas<220>tras, ç
considered to be more important than others: Sa<209>k<218>epa-·<193>r<200>rakam ç
of Sarva-j<210><193>tma  Muni  (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 900),  Vivara<207>a- ç
prameya-sa<209>graha of Vidy<193>ra<207>ya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1350), ç
Brahmas<220>tra-d<200>pik<193> of <185>a<209>kar<193>-nanda (14th ç
cent. <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) and Brahma- tattva-prak<193>·ik<193> of Sad<193>·iva-brahmendra ç
(18th cent. <MS>A.<|>D.<D>)
Comparatively speaking, the Brahma-s<220>tra literature of the other ç
schools of Ved<193>nta is not so voluminous though it is in no way ç
inferior in its quality and erudition.
@SPACE1 = 
After creating his magnum opus, the <185>r<200>bh<193><218>ya, R<193>m<193>nuja ç
wrote two more treatises on the Brahmas<220>tras entitled Ved<193>ntad<200>pa ç
and Ved<193>ntas<193>ra. The <185>r<200>bh<193><218>ya has only ç
one ancient commentary, the <185>rutaprak<193>·ik<193> of Sudar·ana-s<220>ri ç
(13th cent. <MS>A.<|>D.<D>). On this, Ved<193>nta De·ika (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1268-1369) wrote a gloss called Tattva<219><200>k<193>.
Apart from his bh<193><218>ya (generally called the Madhva-bh<193><218>ya) ç
on the Brahma-s<220>tras, Madhva wrote the A<207>ubh<193><218>ya ç
in verses, giving the gist of the various adhikara<207>as of the work. ç
R<193>ghavendra-t<200>rtha (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1598-1671) has written an ç
extensive commentary on this and has named it Tattvama<210>jar<200>.
Trivikrama Pa<207><195>ita, a disciple of Madhva, has commented upon ç
the bh<193><218>ya of Madhva. It is called the Tattvad<200>pik<193>. ç
Tattvaprak<193>·ik<193> of Jayat<200>rtha (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1365-1388) ç
and T<193>tparyacandrik<193> of Vy<193>sar<193>ya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1481) are the other commentaries on the same.
However, the most celebrated work of the Dvaita school of Madhva is ç
the Ny<193>yasudh<193> of Jayat<200>rtha which is a highly dialectical ç
and yet lucid commentary on Madhva's Anuvy<193>khy<193>na, a work ç
elucidating his own commentary on the Brahmas<220>tras.
Nimb<193>rka's  commentary  on  the Brahmas<220>tras, known as the ç
Ved<193>nta-p<193>rij<193>ta-saurabha, has been expounded further ç
by Sr<200>niv<193>sa (13th cent. <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) in his Ved<193>ntakaustubha ç
which again has been explained further by Ke·ava K<193>·m<200>rin ç
(15th cent. <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) in his Ved<193>nta-kaustubha-prabh<193>.
@SPACE1 = 
The other commentaries which have drawn the attention of the Ved<193>ntic ç
scholars are the Vij<210><193>n<193>m<216>ta-bh<193><218>ya of Vij<210><193>nabhik<218>u ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1550) and the commentary S<220>k<218>ma on Baladeva's ç
Govinda-bh<193><218>ya.
