	(Kau<218><200>taki Br<193>hma<207>a Upani<218>ad 3)
The king Pratardana, son of Divo-d<193>sa, goes to the svargaloka ç
(or heaven) by the dint of his powers. Pleased with it, Indra the ç
lord of svargaloka offers him a boon. Pratardana requests Indra himself ç
to select a boon that is the best for human beings. Then Indra teaches ç
him, `Know me! That is the best for human beings!'
Indra has realised his identity with the <193>tman, who is the mukhyapr<193><207>a ç
(the chief life-force) and praj<210><193> (pure consciousness). Hence ç
no evil or sin can ever taint him. One who meditates on him as pr<193><207>a ç
and praj<210><193>, lives for a long time here and then goes to the ç
immortal world or attains immortality.
The mukhyapr<193><207>a and praj<210><193> always go together and ç
are inseparable. They depart together when the body dies. The word ç
pr<193><207>a also indicates an indriya or sense-organ. As long as ç
the mukhyapr<193><207>a remains in the body, the departure or loss ç
of the other pr<193><207>as or indriyas does not result in the death ç
of the body.
Ultimately, the mukhyapr<193><207>a and the praj<210><193> (or praj<210><193>tm<193>) ç
are one and the same. They are the same truth looked at from two different ç
angles†the <193>tman, which again, is Brahman. He is <193>nanda or ç
bliss, who is beyond old-age and death. He is not affected by good ç
or bad deeds. He is the Lord of the universe.

In this vidy<193> the life of a human being has been compared to a ç
yaj<210>a or sacrifice.
A Somay<193>ga (or Soma sacrifice) has three savanas (extraction of ç
soma juice), each of which is associated with a mantra and a group ç
of deities. By meditating on his life in the manner prescribed here, ç
a man can attain good health and longevity of 116 years. This is puru<218>ayaj<210>a.
He should meditate on the first 24years of his life as pr<193>tas-savana ç
(morning-extraction) and his pr<193><207>as (the vital airs and senses) ç
as the gods known as Vasus. If he gets any disease, he should pray ç
to these Vasus to join his life to the next savana, the m<193>dhyandinasavana, ç
of 44 years thereby overcoming the disease and increasing the longevity.
He should then meditate on these 44years as m<193>dhyandinasavana ç
(noon- extraction) and his pr<193><207>as (vital airs) as the associated ç
deities, the Rudras. If he falls sick during this period he should ç
pray tothese Rudras to join his life to the t<216>t<200>yasavana ç
(the third or evening extraction).
After this, he is advised to meditate on the next 48 years as the ç
t<216>t<200>yasavana (the third or final or evening extraction) as ç
also the deities associated with it, the °dityas. An earnest prayer ç
to these °dityas in case of illness will set things right.
The number of years (24, 44 and 48) is determined by the number of ç
letters in the three mantras (in the metres g<193>yatr<200>, tri<218><219>ubh ç
and jagat<200>) used for extraction.
Mahid<193>sa Aitareya is said to have practised this vidy<193> and ç

This vidy<193> was taught to <185>vetaketu by his father Udd<193>laka ç
°ru<207>i.
In spite of undergoing a long course of training under a competent ç
teacher, <185>vetaketu did not know the fundamental truth  by  knowing  which  everything ç
unknown becomes known.
Udd<193>laka states that it is Sat. In thebeginning, before creation, ç
Sat alone existed, the one without a second. It thought, `Let me become ç
many. Let me reproduce myself.' Then it evolved into this world through ç
the three fundamental elements†fire, water and earth.
Sat or Sadvastu is the original funda- mental reality eternally existing.

The teaching of the sage Raikva to the king J<193>na·ruti Pautr<193>ya<207>a ç
has been designated as Sa<221>vargavidy<193>.
J<193>na·ruti Pautr<193>ya<207>a was a noble king, well-known for ç
his generosity, especially for distributing food to the needy.
Once he heard from some swans flying over his palace that the greatness ç
of a sage called Raikva far exceeded his own. After a vigorous search, ç
he was able to locate the sage sitting under a cart. He approached ç
this sage Raikva in a manner sanctioned by social conventions. Then ç
Raikva taught him the Sa<221>varga-vidy<193>.
Sa<221>varga means the ultimate substratum which absorbs everything ç
into itself.
V<193>yu (the cosmic air) is sa<221>varga in the external world since ç
agni (fire), candra (moon), s<220>rya (sun) and <193>pa (water) get ç
absorbed into it at the time of dissolution.
Mukhyapr<193><207>a (the chief vital air) is sa<221>varga in the body ç
since in deep sleepthe sense-organs and the mind get dissolved in ç
it.
If one identifies the Mukhyapr<193><207>a with V<193>yu and meditates ç
on it as Vir<193><219> (the Cosmic Being), he is able to see (realise) ç
everything that may be lying in the ten directions.

Brahman  is  designated  here  as taj-jal<193>n since he is responsible ç
for the creation (taj), dissolution (tal) and preservation or ç
living, (tan) of this world. One has to meditate upon this Brahman.
He is the same as the <193>tman inside this body. He works through ç
the mind. The pr<193><207>a or the chief life-force is his body. He ç
is very subtle, resplendent, all-powerful, all-pervading even though ç
bereft of all sense-organs.
He is in the heart and is subtler than the subtlest. He is also greater ç
than the greatest since he is identical with Brahman.
One who meditates upon him thus, attains him after the death of the ç
body.

A s<193>man is a <216>k or mantra of the <184>gveda set to the intonation ç
system of the S<193>maveda. Its singing has several steps (called ç
bhakti) such as udg<200>tha, hi<209>k<193>ra, prast<193>va and so ç
on.
In the singing of a s<193>man, the udg<200>tha comes first and is ç
sung by the udg<193>t<216> priest. It always begins with O<221>. While ç
chanting it, one should meditate upon Param<193>tman, considering ç
it as his prat<200>ka (word-symbol).
The udg<200>tha is the essence of s<193>man.
One who meditates thus, is able to get the desires of the yajam<193>na ç
(sacrificer) fulfilled.
This is Udg<200>thavidy<193>.
The entire first chapter of the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad is devoted ç

	(`knowledge received by Upakosala')<R>ç
	(Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad 4.10 to 15)
Upakosala K<193>mal<193>yana was a disciple of Satyak<193>ma J<193>b<193>la. ç
Though the teacher permitted his other disciples toreturn home after ç
completing their education spread over twelve years, he did not allowUpakosala ç
to go back. In spite of his own wife requesting Satyak<193>ma to teach ç
Upakosala, he ignored her and went away on tour.
Unable  to  bear  this  neglect, Upakosala started fasting. Taking ç
pity on him the three Vedic fires†g<193>rhapatya, anv<193>h<193>ryapacana ç
and <193>havan<200>ya†taught him first collectively, and then individually ç
about Brahman.
The gist of their teaching is as follows: Pr<193><207>a (the chief ç
life-force), kam (happiness) and kham (<193>k<193>·a or space)are ç
Brahman. It means the bliss of Brahman one gets if one meditates on ç
him as identified with the <193>tman in one's heart.
The fires then taught him about their identity with p<216>thv<200> ç
(earth), <193>ditya (sun), ap (water), candra (moon), <193>k<193>·a ç
(sky or space) and other cosmic phenomena. One who understands this, ç
destroys all his sins, lives long and attains the world of Agni.
After  returning  home  Satyak<193>ma discovered that his disciple ç
was shining brightly with knowledge. Learning from him that the Vedic ç
fires had taught him, the teacher imparted the knowledge of the <193>tman ç
energising the senses like the eyes and his identity with Brahman ç
as also the result of this knowledge viz., attaining Brahmaloka from ç
which there is no return.
This has been termed Upakosala-vidy<193>.

Five sages†Pr<193>c<200>na·<193>la, Satyayaj<210>a, Indradyumna, Jana ç

and Brahman (Cosmic Being) but could not come to any conclusion. Then ç
they went to Udd<193>laka °ru<207>i for enlightenment. Since he too ç
did not know, he took them all to the king A·vapati Kaikeya.
Since they approached him as disciples in all humility, the king started ç
teaching them.
In the ultimate analysis, <193>tman and Brahman are identical. They ç
are called here by the name Vai·v<193>nara.
When the king questioned them one by one, whom they were meditating ç
upon as the Vai·v<193>nara, they replied in different ways. The objects ç
of their meditation were: dyuloka (heaven), <193>ditya (sun), v<193>yu ç
(air), <193>k<193>·a (sky or space), <193>pa (water) and p<216>thv<200> ç
(earth).
Since Vai·v<193>nara is the Cosmic Being enveloping the whole world ç
and since these sages were meditating only on one limb or aspect of ç
him, as if that represented the whole Being, their knowledge was partial ç
and defective. The king A·vapati Kaikeya then taught them about the ç
true nature of Vai·v<193>nara as the whole.

The Vedas are considered a great treasure  of  knowledge  and  spiritual ç
wisdom. They should be imparted only by a qualified teacher to a qualified ç
student.
This is described in detail in the Nirukta (2.4), and is called ç
Vidy<193>s<220>kta.
The following is a brief summary of the same:
The  goddess  of  Vedic  learning approached  a  learned  br<193>hma<207>a  and ç
addressed him thus:
`Protect me, because I am your wealth. Do not give me (impart my knowledge) ç
to anyone who is jealous, who is not guileless and who has no self-control. ç
Then only I will become very powerful. What you teach to your disciple ç
must be pleasant to his ears. The disciple should consider his guru ç
(teacher) as superior even to his own father and mother; and,should ç
never hate him. One who dishonours his guru can never reap the benefits ç
of knowledge. Teach me to one who is pure, not careless, is endowed ç
with brahmacarya (continence) and is intelligent; and never to one ç
who dislikes you.'
@NT = vij<193>t<200>yabheda
@N1 = (`difference based on<R>ç

Bheda or difference is one of the concepts discussed in the Ved<193>ntic ç
treatises to establish the nature of the ultimate realities. It is ç
generally classified into three varieties: saj<193>t<200>yabheda; ç
vij<193>t<200>ya-bheda; svagatabheda.
A cow and a horse are different fromone another because they belong ç
to different j<193>tis or categories. This is an example of vij<193>t<200>yabheda.
Among a number of cows, one cow is different from another cow. This ç
is an example of saj<193>t<200>yabheda or difference within the same ç
category.
Within the body of a cow, the horns, the legs, the tail and the ears ç
are all different from one another. This is the example for svagatabheda ç
or internal differences.

but accepts the third. According to this, the j<200>vas (individual ç

Great saints have often shown thatthey have extraordinary powers ç
of intuition and prediction. Purandarad<193>sa (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1484-1564), ç
one of the great vai<218><207>ava saints of Karnataka, had foretold ç
that his last son Madhvapati would have to be reborn to complete his ç
own mission of composing many more devotional songs which he could ç
not do. The Harid<193>sa tradition of Karnataka (See <MS>D°SAK<188><187>A<D>.) ç
believes that Vijayad<193>sa was the reincarnation of Madhvapati.
Born as the eldest son of S<200>nappa and K<220>samma at C<200>kalapari ç
(in the Raichur district of Karnataka) Vijaya-d<193>sa's original ç
name was D<193>sappa. He grew in that village without much education, ç
into a young man. Poverty and selfishness of the people around him ç
as also the arrogance of his own rich uncle, forced him to abandon ç
his house and walk all the way to K<193>·<200>. There, on the bank ç
of the river Ga<209>g<193>, when he fell asleep, the saint Purandarad<193>sa ç
is said to have appeared in his dream and initiated him, instantly ç
converting him into the sage Vijayad<193>sa.
He toured the country extensively, mostly in Southern India, Tirupati ç
andU<195>upi being his favourite places of pilgrimage.
Among his disciples, the following became more well-known in course ç

Vijayad<193>sa has left a very large number of devotional songs, especially ç
of a particular type called `su<202><193>di'. The language is simple ç
and generally deals with such topics as greatness of God's divine ç
name, need for the grace of the guru and God, importance of j<210><193>na ç

Festivals and sacred days observed by the Hindus are not only days ç

One of the most popular of such festivals is the Vijayada·am<200> ç
(the tenth day in the bright half of the month of °·vayuja or °·vina ç

This word has several senses. When manas or the mind is defined as ç
that part of the anta<199>kara<207>a (inner organ) which is responsible ç
for sa<207>kalpa and vikalpa, the word vikalpa stands for doubt.
In a more technical sense, it stands for an alternative or an option. ç
If a Vedic passage declares that one can offer sacrifice with vr<200>hi ç
(rice) or yava (barley), it is a vikalpa that gives a choice to the ç
sacrificer.
The  dharma·<193>stras  give  many vikalpas or alternatives in the ç
performance of certain rituals (vide Manusm<216>ti 3.267).
The Yogas<220>tras (1.9) uses the word vikalpa to indicate that ç
wave of the mind which arises after hearing a word even though there ç
is no corresponding real object outside. For instance, when we hear ç
the word ``R<193>hu's head,'' the idea of a head that arises in the ç
mind is a vikalpa because R<193>hu (the planet) has only a head and ç
no other part of the body.

(=nine  gems),  including  K<193>lid<193>sa, Dhanvantari, Var<193>hamihira ç
and Vararuci, in his court under his patronage.
Later quite a few kings of the historical period assumed this name ç
as a title.
The Vikrama·aka is reckoned from the year 57 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>, probably ç
the year of hiscoronation. This ·aka is commonly observed and used ç
in North India.

The Vikrama·<200>la monastery is one of the three well-known centres ç
of learning of ancient and medieval India, the other two being the ç
Tak<218>a·il<193> and the N<193>land<193>.
This  Buddhist  monastery  which developed into a great centre of ç
learning was established by the king Dharmap<193>la (reign <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
770-810) of the P<193>la dynasty, ruling over Bihar and Bengal. The ç
centre itself was named Vikrama·<200>la monastery, the word `Vikrama·<200>la' ç
being a title of the king Dharmap<193>la.
It was located at the top of a hill, on the bank of the river Ga<209>g<193> ç
in the Magadha country. This has been identified with the hill P<193>thargh<193><219>a ç
near Bh<193>galpur (in the Bihar State).
The spiritual head of the monastery was called Vajr<193>c<193>rya. ç
The very first Vajr<193>c<193>rya was Buddhaj<210><193>nap<193>da, ç
a disciple of Haribhadra, the guru (spiritual preceptor) of Dharmap<193>la.
It grew into a mighty centre of learning, not only of Buddhism but ç
also of other branches of learning.
There were 108 cells set apart for Buddhist monks. Some were meant ç
for the practice of t<193>ntrik disciplines and others for living. ç
These monks called pa<207><195>itas, were in charge of the various ç
departments of the monastery.
Students would flock from all parts of the country and also from foreign ç
countries, especially from Tibet.
Diplomas would be awarded to the proficient students, including the ç
monks.
Many Sanskrit works were translated here into the Tibetan language.
The institution which was devoted to Mah<193>y<193>na Buddhism had ç
to face troubles created by <185>r<193>vakas or bhik<218>us from Si<221>ha<202>a ç
who followed H<200>nay<193>na.
The campus had six dv<193>ras or Main gates, each under the charge ç
of a dv<193>rapa<207><195>ita, responsible for the admission of students ç
as also to face the scholars of other schools and systems.
This wonderful institution was destroyed in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1205 by ç
the Muslim invaders.

@NT = vik<218>epa
@N1 = (`throwing,' `distracting')
This is a technical word used in several senses.
In the Ny<193>ya philosophy, it is interpreted as `evasion'. When ç
a person, who is involved in a disputation, finds himself on the losing ç
side and tries to escape by saying that he has to go on some urgent ç
business, it is called `vik<218>epa' (vide Ny<193>yas<220>tras 5.2.19).
In the Yogas<220>tras (1.30), the word is used to indicate those ç
nine factors such as vy<193>dhi (illness), pram<193>da (heedlessness) ç
and avirati (absence of renunciation), which act as antar<193>yas ç
or obstacles to the practice of yoga.
In the Advaita Ved<193>nta, it is one of the two ·aktis (powers) of ç
avidy<193> (nescience). For instance, avidy<193> covers the real nature ç
of the rope as rope by its <193>vara<207>a·akti (covering power) and ç
makes it appear as a snake by its vik<218>epa·akti (power of projection).
@NT = vim<193>na
@N1 = (`an object that is measured')
Though etymologically this word is defined as something which is measured ç
(m<193> = to measure), it is used in a technical sense. According ç
to the works on ancient Hindu architecture it can mean any of the ç
following: a chariot of the gods flying in heavenly regions; a house ç
or a palace, especially the one which is seven-storeys in height; ç
the small tower over the garbhag<216>ha or the sanctum sanctorum ç
of a temple.
This  last  one  can  be  of  three architectural types: n<193>gara ç
(curvilinear); dr<193>vi<195>a (pyramidal); vesara (combination of ç
the former two).

@NT = Vimukt<193>tman
@N1 = (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1200)
Vimukt<193>tman is one of the important advaitins of the post-<185>a<209>kara ç
period. His famous work, the I<218><219>asiddhi, is widely acclaimed ç
as a standard treatise, one of the four Siddhi-works, the other ç
three being Advaitasiddhi, Brahmasiddhi and Nai<218>karmyasiddhi.
Except that he was a disciple of Avyay<193>tman, nothing more is known ç
abouthim.
He is said to have written one more work called Pram<193><207>a-v<216>tti-nir<207>aya, ç
not yetpublished.
See <MS>I<186><187>ASIDDHI<D> also.
@NT = Vina·ana
Sarasvat<200>, the mighty river of <184>gveda fame†called nad<200>tam<193> ç
in the <184>gveda (2.41.16)†now known as Sarsuti, comes down the ç
Siwalik range near Ambala (in the Haryana State) and disappears in ç
the sands near Sirsa. This place was called Vina·ana during the period ç
of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata (vide Ara<207>yaparva 130.2).
According to the Manusm<216>ti (2.21) it was the western limit of ç
what was then known as the Madhyade·a.
@NT = Vinat<193>
She was a daughter of Dak<218>apraj<193>pat<200> and one of the 13 ç
wives of the sage Ka·yapa. Aru<207>a, the charioteer of S<220>rya ç
(Sun-god) and Garu<195>a (the eagle-mount of Vi<218><207>u) were her ç
sons.
Since her pregnancy had lasted too long, she is said to have pressed ç
her belly. As a result, the baby inside (i.e. Aru<207>a) was deformed. ç
He was born without the thighs. Hence he was named `An<220>ru' (one ç
without thighs).
Once she lost a bet with her co-wife Kadr<220> and had to become her ç
slave. Garu<195>a released her from slavery by getting Kadr<220> what ç
she wanted.
@NT = Vin<193>yaka
@N1 = (`one who has no master')
See <MS>GAØAPATI<D>.
This word is sometimes used to indicate Buddha and Garu<195>a also.
In the M<193>navag<216>hyas<220>tras (2.14) four Vin<193>yakas have ç
been mentioned. They are:<185><193>laka<219>a<209>ka<219>a, K<220><218>m<193><207><195>ar<193>japutra, ç
Usmita and Devayajana.
These Vin<193>yakas are evil spirits causing such obstacles in life ç
as maidens not getting good husbands, married ladies not blessed with ç
children, princes not becoming  kings  though  eligible,  men losing ç
one's children or crops and so on. Propitiatory rites like Vin<193>yaka·<193>nti ç
or Ga<207>apatip<220>j<193> have to be done to offset these evil spirits.
@NT = Vin<193>yaka·<193>nti
Sometimes called Ga<207>apatip<220>j<193>, this·<193>nti (propitiatory ç
rite) is generally performed at the commencement of all sa<221>sk<193>ras ç
or sacraments like upanayana, viv<193>ha (marriage), as also for averting ç
the evil effects of stars and planets, and soon.
When it is performed independently, ·uklapak<218>a-caturth<200> (4th ç
day of the bright fortnight) associated with auspicious stars like ç
Pu<218>ya, <185>r<193>va<207>a, Rohi<207><200> and A·vin<200> as also ç
the weekday, Thursday, is recommended.
The Bhavi<218>yottarapur<193><207>a (Ch. 144) gives a Ga<207>apati·<193>nti, ç
which is similar to the Vin<193>yaka·<193>nti.
See also <MS><185>°NTIS<D>.
@NT = Vindhya
This is the famous mountain range separating the Deccan Plateau from ç
the Indo-Gangetic plains of North India.
According to the ancient legends, theVindhya mountain (considered ç
a living deity)  asked  S<220>rya  (the  Sun-god)  to circumambulate ç
him also, even as he was doing to the Meru mountain. When S<220>rya ç
politely refused, Vindhya started growing taller and taller, obstructing ç
his path. The gods in heaven who were alarmed at this, requested the ç
great sage Agastya to intervene. When Agastya arrived, Vindhya bowed ç
down to him. The sage commanded him to be like that, until he returned ç
from the south, which he never did!
Some of the rivers that take their birth from the Vindhya are: Tapat<200>, ç
Payo<218><207><200>, Nirvindhy<193>, Ve<207><193>, Kumudvat<200>, ç
Durgam<193> and <185><200>l<193>.
Vindhyap<216><218><219>ha is the territory of this region wherein ç
the following races (of people) live: M<193>lada, Karu<218>a, Utkala, ç
M<193><218>a,  Da·<193>r<207>a,  Bhoja,  Ki<218>kindhaka, V<200>tihotra ç
and Avanti (vide Matsyapur<193><207>a Ch. 114, verses 53 to 55).
@NT = viniyogavidhi
@N1 = (`injunction regarding<R>ç
application')
Vedic sacrifices involve quite complicated rites. Hence treatises ç
on the P<220>rva-m<200>m<193><221>s<193> take great pains to explain ç
in detail all the subtle points in their performance.
A vidhi is a Vedic injunction regarding the performance of any Vedic ç
rite like a y<193>ga or sacrifice.
Some of the vidhis are: utpattividhi or pradh<193>navidhi; viniyogavidhi ç
or gu<207>a-vidhi; vi·i<218><219>avidhi.
The first vidhi indicates the main rite such as, `One who desires ç
to attain svarga (heaven) should perform the Agnihotra sacrifice.'
The second one, the viniyogavidhi, gives the details of the performance, ç
like `He has to offer curds as oblation into the fire (of Agnihotra).'
In the third one, the vi·i<218><219>avidhi, the speciality is pointed ç
out. For instance, if it is declared, `One has to perform the sacrifice ç
through soma,' it should be understood that a sacrifice in which the ç
soma juice is to be offered, is meant here.
@NT = vip<193>ka
@N1 = (`ripening')
In general, this word means the ripening state. However, it is used ç
more in a technical sense as karmavip<193>ka or the ripening of karma ç
(actions about to give their results).
According to the Yogas<220>tras (2.13) of Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) ç
vip<193>ka of a karma results in three things: j<193>ti (birth in ç
a particular species of living beings); <193>yus (duration of life); ç
bhoga (experience of good and bad results).
See also <MS>KARMAVIP°KA<D>.
In the ancient medical sciences, the word was used to indicate the ç
state of digestion of food.
@NT = vipar<200>takhy<193>ti
See under <MS>KHY°TI<D>.
@NT = viparyaya
@N1 = (`contrariety')
This is a technical term used in the Yogas<220>tras (1.6, 8).
The cittav<216>ttis or the modifications of the mind, though they ç
appear to be infinite, can be classified into five groups: pram<193><207>a ç
(means of valid knowledge), viparyaya (contrariety), vikalpa (mere ç
concept), nidr<193> (sleep) and sm<216>ti (memory).
Viparyaya, the second, is defined as mithy<193>j<210><193>na†false ç
knowledge†not based on reality. When, in twilight, we see a snake ç
in a rope lying on the ground, it is viparyaya, seeing one thing for ç
another.
Avidy<193> is another name for it.
@NT = Vip<193>·<193>
@N1 = (`without bonds')
The <184>gveda (3.33.1 and 3; 4.30.11) mentions the river Vip<193><219> ç
or Vip<193>·. It has been identified with the modern Beas river in ç
the Punjab.
According to the Mah<193>bh<193>rata, when the demon Kalm<193><218>ap<193>da ç
devoured Vasi<218><219>ha's son <185>akti, Vasi<218><219>ha tried ç
to commit suicide (due to intense sorrow) by tying himself with ropes ç
and falling into this river, then known as Uru<210>jir<193>. Being ç
afraid of incurring the sin of killing a br<193>hma<207>a sage, the ç
river (or the presiding goddess of the river) unbounded him and carried ç
him to the bank. Hence Vasi<218><219>ha gave it the name Vip<193>·<193> ç
(that which freedhim from the bonds; p<193>·a = bond) (Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
°diparva 177.6).
@NT = vipra
@N1 = (`one in whom [the seed of dharma] has sprouted')
A br<193>hma<207>a is known by several names, one of which is the ç
word vipra. The <184>gveda (10.112.9) uses this word as applied ç
to the deity Ga<207>apati.
Etymologically, it means one in whom the seed of dharma has already ç
sprouted.
In a more technical sense, he is a br<193>hma<207>a who has undergone ç
the necessary sacraments and is also endowed with the vidy<193> or ç
knowledge of the scriptures. He is expected to discharge six duties: ç
yajana (performing a sacrifice); y<193>jana (conducting a sacrifice ç
for others); adhya-yana (studying the scriptures); adhy<193>pana (teaching ç
the scriptures to others); d<193>na (giving gifts to others); and, ç
pratigraha (accepting gifts in accordance with dharma).
These six are called the <218>a<219>karmas for a br<193>hma<207>a.
The tree a·vattha (Ficus religiosa) is also known by this name and ç
considered worthy of worship like a br<193>hma<207>a.
@NT = Vipran<193>r<193>ya<207>a
See <MS>°<170>V°RS<D>.
@NT = V<200>rabhadra
When Dak<218>a, the Praj<193>pati, performed a great sacrifice, he ç
did not invite <185>iva†his own son-in-law†for the same. Sat<200>, ç
<185>iva's wife and Dak<218>a's daughter, went to attend the sacrifice ç
much against the advice of her husband. Dak<218>a ignored her and ç
also reviled her husband <185>iva. Unable to stand the insult, she ç
gave up her body using her yogic powers. When <185>iva got this news, ç
he was infuriated. Hecreated an ogre from his hair and commanded ç
him to destroy Dak<218>a's sacrifice. This ogre was V<200>rabhadhra. ç
He was a partial manifestation of Rudra/<185>iva.
Iconographical works show V<200>ra-bhadra in different ways. He is ç
shown with two arms, four arms or eight arms. Objects shown in his ç
hands are: sword, shield, bow, arrow, trident, skull-cup, goad, antelope, ç
mace and hand-drum. He wears a garland of several heads and rides ç
on a vet<193>la or a vampire.
Bhadrak<193>l<200> (his spouse) and Dak<218>a with the head of a goat ç
in the posture of supplication are shown by his side.
V<200>rabhadra is shown in a small shrine in all the temples of <185>iva. ç
He is also shown in the panels showing the Sapta-m<193>t<216>k<193>s ç
(See <MS>SAPTAM°T<184>K°S.<D>).

This is a technical term used in the Ved<193>ntic works.
If ®·vara is the original creator of this world, Hira<207>yagarbha ç
is his first evolute. From him emanates Vir<193>j or Vir<193><219>. ç
He is the cosmic being having the totality of the gross bodies of ç
the world as his body. He is also called Vai·v<193>nara.
Vi·va is his manifestation at the individual level.
K<216><218><207>a declares in the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (15.14) that ç
it is he who, as Vai·v<193>nara, digests the food in the bodies of ç
all living beings.
The Puru<218>as<220>kta (5) declares that Vir<193><219> was born ç
out of the °dipuru<218>a or the primeval being. The Mu<207><195>aka ç
Upani<218>ad (2.1.4) describes his cosmic form having Agni or fire ç
as his head, Candra and S<220>rya (the moon and the sun) as his eyes, ç
the dik or the quarters as his ears and so on. He is the antar<193>tm<193>, ç

One of the most important of these is the Viraj<193>homa.
It is a lengthy ritual. It comprises offering forty oblations in a ç
duly consecrated fire with fuel sticks, cooked rice and ghee. The ç
mantras are the ones given in the Mah<193>n<193>r<193>ya<207>a Upani<218><193>d ç

be purified, may I be light or illumination, free from rajas and from ç
evil, sv<193>h<193>!'
This is repeated a number of times to include several items such as ç
