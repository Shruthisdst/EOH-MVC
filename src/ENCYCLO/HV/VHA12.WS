The sky dear to him is allpervading. Those who want to reach him are ç
performing sacrifices and giving gifts. In his world bliss is constantly ç
flowing.
That Vi<218><207>u by whose power all theworlds are supported, is ç
praised for transcending them through his three steps. He is being ç
praised as the supreme even as the lion in a mountain is, by other ç
animals.
O Lord Vi<218><207>u! None is able to know the limits of your cosmic ç
body! We know only its two aspects†the earth and the sky. Other aspects ç
like the heavenly worlds are known only to you.
This Lord Vi<218><207>u pervaded this earth in order to give it to ç
the gods who requested him for it. Those who pray to him live a steady ç
and happy life. It is he who has created these worlds to grant them ç
to his votaries.
May that Vi<218><207>u who occupied the three worlds be our Master. ç
His very name Vi<218><207>u shows his greatness.
May the gods protect us, who are living in that part of the earth, ç
occupied by the cosmic strides of Vi<218><207>u!
@SPACE1 = 
When Vi<218><207>u occupied this earth through his three steps, it ç
was covered over by the dust raised.
When Vi<218><207>u, the all-powerful protector traversed the worlds ç
with his three cosmic steps, he automatically upheld allaspects of ç
dharma. Look at this Vi<218><207>u,the friend of Indra, by whose ç
graceone is able to perform the Vedic rites!
Just as one can perceive the all- pervading sky without any obstruction, ç
the persons endowed with spiritual wisdom can see the highest Abode ç
of Vi<218><207>u always.
The wise men highly praise this Abode of Vi<218><207>u with appropriate ç
hymns.
(The last mantra is a phala·ruti or eulogy. Its recitation results ç

Most of these mantras are <216>ks taken from the <184>gveda. The ç
commentators have also given the viniyoga (their use in Vedic sacrifices) ç
for them. For instance, the fifth mantra (`vicakrame p<216>thiv<200>me<218>a....') ç
is to be chanted in the sacrifice called Ukthya. The seventh mantra ç
(`ato dev<193>....') has to be used in the Dar·ap<220>r<207>am<193>sa ç
sacrifice during the oblations for the expiation of sins.
@NT = Vi<218><207>utattvavinir<207>aya
Madhv<193>c<193>rya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1238-1317), the chief architect ç
of Dvaita Ved<193>nta, has 37 works to his credit. Out of them ten ç
are prakara<207>agranthas or treatises dealing solely with his Dvaita ç
philosophy. The Vi<218><207>utattvavinir<207>aya is the most complete ç
and outstanding among them.
It is in prose and is spread over three paricchedas or chapters. The ç
first is the biggest and most exhaustive. The other two are very short.
God the Supreme, called Vi<218><207>u, N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, Hari ç
or V<193>sudeva, can be known only through the sad<193>gamas or true ç
scriptures. They are the Vedas, the two epics and the P<193><210>car<193>tra ç
texts. The Vedas are the supreme authority since they are apauru<218>eya ç
(not a creation of human beings).
Vi<218><207>u is the Supreme Reality. Mok<218>aor liberation is attained ç
only by his grace. His grace can be got only by the  knowledge  of  his  greatness  and ç
devotion to him.
The identity of the j<200>va (the individual soul) and ®·vara (God)†as ç
the advaitins aver†can never be proved in any way. Vedic sentences ç
like tat-tvam-asi have been shown that they teach only difference ç
and not identity.
The second chapter shows the greatness of Vi<218><207>u and his consort ç
Lak<218>m<200> as also the inferiority of all other deities like Brahm<193> ç
and <185>iva.
The  third†the  last†chapter  is devoted to prove how Vi<218><207>u ç
is perfect, beyond all limitations.
Out of the several commentaries, the A<207>usudh<193> by Jayat<200>rtha ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1340-1388) is the best. It has seven sub-commentaries.

The mind is constantly rising in the form of v<216>ttis or waves of ç
thoughts and emotions and hence difficult to control. Pata<210>jali ç
(200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) in his monumental work the Yogas<220>tras, gives ç
a few methods called parikarmas, in seven s<220>tras (1.33 to 39) ç
which help in controlling the mind. One of them is indicated by this ç
s<220>tra: vi·ok<193> v<193> jyoti<218>mat<200> (1.36).
When the mind is directed towards the su<218>umn<193>n<193><195><200> ç
which is in the middle of the spinal column, but extends right up ç
to s<220>ryaman<195>ala (the orb of the sun), one is able to get a ç

@NT = vi<218><219>i
This is a technical term used in Hindu  Astrology.  (See <MS>PA<178>C°<177>GA<D>  for ç

Vi<218><219>i is half of a tithi (lunar day). The works on astrology ç
have raised it to the status of an illformed malignant demoness. Vi<218><219>i ç
has to be avoided for any auspicious undertaking. Works like the B<216>hatsa<221>hit<193> ç
prescribe a Vi<218><219>ivrata to appease her.
@NT = Vi<218>uvasa<209>kr<193>nti
Sa<209>kr<193>nti is the apparent passage of the sun from one r<193>·i ç

sun leaves Dhanus and enters Makara, it is designated Makarasa<209>kr<193>nti.
Me<218>asa<209>kr<193>nti and Tul<193>sa<209>kr<193>nti are called ç

the father of the famous Naciketas.
It is a soma-sacrifice belonging to the ek<193>ha (spread over one ç

In this sacrifice, the yajam<193>na or sacrificer has to donate one ç
thousand cows or all his wealth, except the share of his eldest ç
son and land. After this sacrifice he has to live for three days each ç
respectively at the root of an udumbara tree (figtree), in a settlement ç

He was the son of Prabh<193>sa (one of the eight Vasus) and Yogasiddhi.
When he had completed his gurukula-v<193>sa (living in the house of ç
the guru for education) his guru and his family made some impossible ç
demands as gurudak<218>i<207><193> (fees) such as an eternally new ç
house, indestructible cloths and so on. He performed tapas, pleased ç
<185>iva and got divine power by which he became an expert in all ç

Vi·v<193>mitra, along with Vasi<218><219>ha, is one of the most well-known ç
<216><218>is or sages that we come across, not only in the Vedas but ç
also in the epics and the pur<193><207>as. He is the <216><218>i for ç
the entire third ma<207><195>ala of the <184>gveda. However, only ç
501 <216>ks are directly attributed to him, the rest being assigned ç
to his descendants.
His prayer to the rivers Vip<193><219> and <185>utudr<200> (the modern ç
Beas and Sutlej rivers in the Punjab State) to make way for him so ç
that he could cross over safely and escape from the robbers pursuing ç
him is famous as the Nad<200>s<220>kta (<184>gveda 3.33).
He has been mentioned as a great sage by several texts of Vedic literature ç
(vide Aitareya °ra<207>yaka 2.2.1; Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> ç

Br<193>hma<207>a 14.3.12).
In the story of <185>una··epha (<184>gveda 1.24) Vi·v<193>mitra ç
appears as the saviour of the young man who had been earmarked to ç
be killed in a Vedic sacrifice. Vi·v<193>mitra adopts him as a son.
As per the Nirukta (2.24) and the Pa<210>cavi<221>·a Br<193>hma<207>a ç
(21.12.2), Vi·v<193>-mitra was a king.
According to the epics and the pur<193><207>as, he was the son of ç
the king G<193>dhiof Candrava<221>·a, known first as Vi·varatha. ç
He had several wives and sons.
The R<193>m<193>ya<207>a (B<193>lak<193><207><195>a, Chapters ç
51 to 65) gives his story in detail. This contains some important ç
incidents like creating a heaven for the king Tri·a<209>ku, his conflict ç
with Vasi<218><219>ha and his ultimately being raised to the status ç
of a Brahmar<218>i.
He is one of the Saptar<218>is (the Seven Sages) for the present age.

@NT = Vi·van<193>tha Temple
K<193>·<200> or V<193>r<193><207>as<200> (in the State of Uttar Pradesh) ç
is the most ancient city of the world. Its presiding deity is Vi·van<193>tha ç
(`Lord of the universe') in the form of a li<209>ga. This is one of ç
the twelve jyotirli<209>gas (`li<209>gas of light'), manifestation ç
of God in the form of a pillar of fire, as mentioned in the pur<193><207>as.
The ancient temple of Vi·van<193>tha has been demolished several times ç
by the Muslim fanatics and rebuilt by the devout Hindus. The present ç
temple is the one built by Ahaly<193>b<193>i Ho<202>kar, the queen ç
of Indore, in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1777. There is reason to believe that ç
the original li<209>ga which had been thrown into the J<210><193>nav<193>p<200> ç
or Gy<193>nv<193>p<200> well (`well of enlightenment') nearby,  was  surreptitiously  recovered, ç
quietly preserved and later installed in this temple. It was ceremonially ç
reconsecrated.
The temple is a stone structure situated in a quadrangle covered with ç
a roof. Two towers and a dome (in between them) rise above the roof. ç
The first tower is above the Da<207><195>ap<193><207><200>·vara shrine ç
and the second, over the sanctum of Vi·va-n<193>tha. On the last is ç
a pole bearing a flag and a trident.
The temple has been built on a piece of land which is 9 metres (30 ç
feet) square. The sanctum is about 2.6 metres (8.5 feet) square. The ç
total height of the tower from the ground is 15 metres (51 feet).
There  are  beautiful  carvings  of different designs.
The temple is kept open from 3 <MS>A.<|>M.<D> to  11 <MS>P.<|>M.<D>  Five  <193>ratis  (ceremonial ç
wavingof light etc.) are done during this period.

In the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (Chapter 11), at the specific request ç
of Arjuna, Lord K<216><218><207>a shows him his Vi·var<220>pa or the ç
Cosmic Form, after endowing him with divine sight, since he could ç
not see it with his ordinary sight.
The verses 10 to 31 describe this Vi·var<220>pa.
The Lord in this Cosmic Form had innumerable heads and hands, decorated ç
gorgeously and holding a large variety of weapons. He was blazing ç
like a thousand suns. Arjuna saw all beings in him† including Brahm<193> ç
the creator, the <216><218>is, right up to animals†stationed in a ç
small part of his body. The Lord had pervaded all the worlds and appeared ç
to be of infinite proportions. All the warriors on the battle field ç
had entered into his mouths and were being mercilessly crushed.
Struck with great fear, Arjuna prays to Him fervently, requesting ç
Him to withdraw it and appear in his old, human, form.
Earlier, in the court of the Kauravas, when Duryodhana spurns all ç
proposals of peace put forward by <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a to ç
avoid war and behaves most arrogantly, even threatening to imprison ç
him, <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a exhibits his Vi·var<220>pa (vide ç
Mah<193>bh<193>rata, Udoyagaparva, Chapter 131).
Vi·var<220>pa (circa <MS>A.<|>D. <D>800) is the nameof a commentator ç

B<193>lakr<200><195><193>. Some scholars identify him with Sure·var<193>c<193>rya, ç
a direct disciple of <185>a<209>kara (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 788-820).
@NT = Vi·vedevas
These are Vedic gods. Literally the word means `all the gods'. Perhaps, ç
all the gods leftover without being specifically mentioned in prayers, ç
are meant to be included under this word. But they gradually seem ç
to evolve as a specific group like the °dityas or the Maruts. These ç
deities are the protectors of <216>ta, the moral law. They destroy ç
the enemies of their devotees, protect the good, give auspicious abodes, ç
and control†like kings. They are ever young and handsome. They are ç
easily pleased by devoted obeisance.
Later  mythology  describes  them usually as ten in number: Vasu (dwelling ç
place), Satya (truth), Kratu (will), Dak<218>a (skill), K<193>la (time), ç
K<193>ma (desire), Dh<216>ti (forbearance), Kuru (the ancestor of ç

goes on refuting that of the exponent. For all practical purposes ç
it is destructive criticism. It is something like abusing the plaintiff's ç

@NT = vitarka
In general, the word means imagination or doubtful knowledge. However, ç
the Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) uses this ç

(perfect concentration) into four varieties, the first one being with ç
vitarka (sa-vitarka) (vide 1.17). Here vitarka is defined as the ç
intense awareness that arises in the mind when it concentrates on ç
a gross object.
In another place (2.33.34) vitarka is identified with certain obstacles ç
to the practice of Yoga.
@NT = Vitast<193>
The <184>gveda mentions the names of several rivers that were well-known ç

It is described as of twelve a<209>gulas.
Works on architecture and icono- graphy have defined this vitasti ç
as themeasurement of a span, the length between the tips of the thumb ç

@NT = viv<193>ha
@N1 = (`taking [the girl] away in a <R>ç
special way;' `marriage')
@SB8.5 = Introduction
Viv<193>ha or marriage is one of the sixteen sa<221>sk<193>ras or ç
sacraments, but considered the most important of them all. Since even ç
the <184>gveda (10.85.6-47) contains a description of the marriage ç
of S<220>ry<193> (the daughter of the Sun-god) with Soma, most of ç
the <216>ks (mantras) of which are used even now in the traditional ç
rites of marriage, it can safely be presumed that it had become a ç
well-established institution even by that time.
The main purpose of marriage was to enable a man, by becoming a householder, ç
to perform Vedic sacrifices and to continue the lineage by procreating ç
worthy children.
@SB8.5 = Forms of Marriage
The sm<216>tis and the dharma·<193>stras have enumerated eight forms ç
of marriage: br<193>hma, daiva, <193>r<218>a, pr<193>j<193>patya, ç
<193>sura,g<193>ndharva, r<193>k<218>asa and pai·<193>ca (vide Manusm<216>ti ç
3.21; Y<193>j<210>avalkya Sm<216>ti 1.58-61).
In the br<193>hma form, the father of the girl gave her respectfully ç
to a man of character and learning, after decking her with such ornaments ç
as he could afford and without taking anything in return.
In the daiva, the decorated girl was given away by her father to a ç
priest who officiated at a sacrifice commenced by him.
After receiving from the bridegroom a pair of kine, exclusively meant ç
to be used in a sacrifice, if the father gave his daughter to him ç
(who was considered worthy) it was <193>r<218>a form of marriage.
If the suitor pays money to the relations of the girl and also the ç
girl herself, and accepts her as his bride out of free will, it is ç
<193>sura form of marriage.
If the bride and the groom choose each other out of love and passion, ç
resulting in their union, it is the g<193>ndharva form.
In the r<193>k<218>asa form of marriage the girl is abducted or captured ç
by force, by killing or injuring her relatives.
In the pai·<193>ca form, the girl is ravished when she is sleeping ç
or is unconscious.
The last two forms being of a criminal nature,  are  condemned.  However,  for ç
k<218>attriya heroes, the r<193>k<218>asa mode was permitted.
At present, it is only the br<193>hma form that is prevalent.
@SPACE1 = 
The system of fixing dowry and making it the main consideration in ç
settling the marriage does not seem to have existed in the ancient ç
times.
@SB8.5 = Prohibited Relationships
@SPACE = 
The dharma·<193>stras have prohibited marriage if the boy and the ç
girl belong to the same pi<207><195>a or gotra. The first prohibition ç
means that the ancestor up to the fifth generation (of forefathers) ç
should not be common to them on the mother's side and the seventh ç
generation on the father's  side.  The  second  prohibition prescribes ç
that they should not be from the same gotra or lineage (See <MS>GOTRA<D> ç
and <MS>PRAVARA<D>.).
Though intercaste marriages were allowed in the ancient period, they ç
were frowned upon during the later years. Similarly,  remarriage  of  widows  was ç
prohibited.
@SB8.5 = Prerequisites
@SPACE = 
Since marriage was considered a sacred and lifelong spiritual bond, ç
several points had to be taken into account before finalising it.
First was the age. Adult marriages were common during the Vedic and ç
the epic periods. Gradually the age was reduced to such an extent ç
that child- marriages became the rule (vide Vasi<218><219>ha Sm<216>ti ç
15).  However,  the  trend  was reversed during the modern period ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1929 onwards after the promulgation of The Child-marriage ç
Restraint Act)
The second consideration was the qualifications expected to be present ç
in the bride and the groom.
The bride had to be a virgin, fairly beautiful, must have a sweet ç
name and without any physical defects. A brotherless girl was not ç
desired on religious considera- tions. The dharma·<193>stra works ç
do not mention anything about her educational qualification.
As regards the groom, he must havecompleted his brahmacarya in the ç
gurukula and must be learned in the Vedas. He must be a sn<193>taka ç
(See <MS>SN°TAKA<D> for details.). He must be physically strong and ç
virile.
Though virginity was insisted upon the bride, a similar condition ç
was not laid on the groom since he could marry again if the first ç
wife was dead or barren.
The sm<216>ti works were very particular about one point, viz., that ç
both the bride and the groom must have come from a good va<221>·a ç
or a pure family, blameless from the highest ethical standards.
@SPACE = 
@SB8.5 = Religious Ceremonies
