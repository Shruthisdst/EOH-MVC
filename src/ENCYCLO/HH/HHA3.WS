@SB = Introduction
@SPACE = 
Hinduism is like a centre of gravity doll which always regains its ç
upright position however much it may be upset. If neither external ç
aggressions nor internal upheavals have destroyed it, if every such ç
cataclysm has only acted as a catalyst to strengthen its inner fibre, ç
it only speaks volumes of its power of resilience and survival.
Unlike  some  of  the  well-known religions of the world, Hinduism ç
does not have a single founder, a single Book, a single Church or ç
even a single way of life. It is precisely due to this factor<192>which, ç
by the way, is its strength and not a weakness†that it has been ç
able to withstand all the onslaughts of time or the barbarous invasions ç
from outside.
Hinduism is like a noble mother who lovingly cares for all of her ç
children, including those that may deny her. An atheist, an agnostic, ç
even a blasphemer, has a place in it as much as a staunch believer.  Such  heretics  are  neither ç
punished nor humiliated, but, just ignored. In case they†in course ç
of time†repent and relent, they have every chance of redeeming themselves.
Hinduism is not idolatry, though theidols of gods†various facets ç
of the Supreme Being†act as stepping stones to the highest mystical ç
experience.
Hinduism is not fatalism, though it preaches through the theory ç
of karma that one reaps what one sows.
Hinduism is not the caste system and its hierarchies, though the ç
system is a part of its social arrangement, based on the division ç
of labour.
Hinduism does not preach or uphold untouchability, though the Hindu ç
society has practised it, firstly due to reasons of public health, ç
and later, due to prejudices.
Hinduism is not responsible for the occasional stagnation of the ç
Hindu society, though the society did, sometimes, stagnate due to ç
its non-adherence to the fundamental principles taught by it.
An earnest study and analysis of such a unique religion is highly ç
rewarding.
@SB = The Name
Strangely enough, `Hinduism' is not its original name! In fact its ç
adherents never gave it any particular name except `dharma,' which ç
simply means `The eternal law that supports and sustains those who ç
practise it'. Nor was there any need to do so since, being ancient†and ç
in a way prehistoric†there was no other religion from which it had ç
to distinguish itself from!
Actually, the origin of the words `Hindu' and `Hinduism' is geographical. ç
The land of the river Sindh<220> (Indus) and thepeople inhabiting ç
it came to be known as <|>`Hindu' <|>among the ancient persians,in ç
whose language, the `S' of Sanskrit became `H'. And this name has ç
somehow stuck.
Looked at from this angle, all reli-gions of Indian origin†whether ç
it is Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism or tribal cults †become different ç
facets of Hinduism. However, in practice, the term is applied specifically ç
to the religion dependent on the Vedas.
@SPACE1 = 
The word `San<193>tana Dharma' (the`Ancient and Eternal Religion') ç
is sometimes applied to Hinduism by its more orthodox followers.
@SB = The Book
The  `Book'  or  the  Scripture  of Hinduism is the Veda, with its ç
fourfold division, viz., <184>gveda, Yajurveda, S<193>ma-veda and ç
Atharvaveda.
Being divinely revealed to the <216><218>is or sages of yore, the ç
Veda is also called `<185>ruti' <|>(what is `heard', hence `revealed'). ç
Since it was not written by human beings, it is termed `apauru<218>eya' ç
or `not created by the human agency'.
All the secondary scriptures that derive their authority from the ç
<185>rutis, that are to be kept in memory while practising their tenets, ç
are accommodated under the omnibus term `sm<216>tis' (sm<216>ti = ç
remembrance). The various dharma-s<220>tras, sm<216>tis, itih<193>sas ç
and pur<193><207>as as also the nibandhas (digests) come under this ç
category.
The <184>gveda is primarily a book of prayers. The Yajurveda is ç
a work of liturgical practices. The S<193>maveda comprises hymns, ç
taken mostly from the <184>gveda and set to music, to be sung at ç
appropriate places in a Vedic sacrifice. The Atharvaveda is like ç
an appendix supplying additional information on all aspects of the ç
Veda.
Each Veda is again divided into four sections: Sa<221>hit<193> (collection ç
of mantras), Br<193>hma<207>a (liturgical instructions, generally ç
in prose), °ra<207>yaka (symbolical contemplation of Vedic rituals, ç
to be practised in forests by the forest-recluses) and Upani<218>ad ç
(metaphysical reflections).
Among the sm<216>tis or secondary scriptures, special mention must ç
be made of the Bhagavadg<200>t<193>, popularly known as the G<200>t<193>. ç
It is a part of the great epic, the Mah<193>bh<193>rata, and is ç
in the form of a dialogue between Arjuna, the P<193><207><195>ava ç
hero and K<216><218><207>a, considered as an incarnation of God.
The G<200>t<193> contains wonderful ideas of ethics, religion and ç
philosophy rolled into one integrated unit and can easily be declared ç
as the Book for all the Hindus of the modern age.
The dharma·<193>stra literature which is voluminous, deals with many ç
aspects of the personal, the social and the legal life of the Hindus. ç
Some of the books of this category are considered as an authority ç
even today by the law-courts while deciding certain types of cases ç
concerning the Hindus.
The pur<193><207>as or mythological lore, are popular works with a ç
mixture of ancient fables and didactic material aimed at educating ç
the masses in our religion and culture.
The <193>gamas, a special class of literature, highly technical in ç
nature, are the guiding lights for the construction and consecration ç
of temples and images, as also  the  various  ritualistic  practices ç
connected with them.
All these secondary scriptures derive their authority from the Vedas ç
and are accepted as authorities as far as their tenets do not go against ç
the spirit of the Vedas.
@SB = The Philosophy
Every religious system must have abasic philosophy to support it ç
and sustainit.
Based on the teachings of the Vedas, including those of the Upani<218>ads, ç
six systems of philosophy†called `dar·anas', products of intuitive ç
thinking and vision (dar·ana = vision)†<|>evolved over the centuries. ç
These systems generally dealt withsome common topics though they ç
specialised in some areas. The common topics are: God; creation; human ç
beings (and the living beings); the problem of good and evil; ethics ç
and morality; destiny of man including the final goal of life; path ç
to perfection.
The Ny<193>ya system of Gautama has developed the science of logic ç
needed for philosophical inquiry and disputations.
The  Vai·e<218>ika system  of Ka<207><193>da advances the atomic ç
theory of creation.
The  S<193><209>khya  system  of  Kapila propounds the theory of the ç
animate souls and inanimate matter as the basic factors in creation.
The Yoga system of Pata<210>jali, while accepting the S<193><209>khyan ç
theory of creation, adds ®·vara or God as the missing element in the ç
process of creation. It, however, concentrates on the eight steps ç
of spiritual practice needed to attain perfection.
The  M<200>m<193><221>s<193>  system  of Jaimini devotes its attention ç
mainly to the interpretation of Vedic sentences, developing in detail ç
a theory of knowledge†six ways of knowing†and stressing the importance ç
of Vedic rites.
@SPACE1 = 
The Ved<193>nta system of B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a Vy<193>sa is the ç
crowning glory of Hindu philosophy. It calls the Supreme Power which ç
projects the universe, sustains it and withdraws it into itself as ç
Brahman. It holds the individual soul, <193>tman, to be eternal and ç
immortal. Attainment of mok<218>a or liberation from the cycle of ç
births and deaths is possible through the know-ledge of Brahman, by ç
being devoted to Brahman. A liberated soul will never again return ç
to mundane existence. This is its teaching in a nutshell.
Different views of interpretation of the Upani<218>ads and the Brahmas<220>tras†a ç
special treatise on the Upani<218>ads†have resulted in three main ç
branches of Ved<193>nta philosophy†Advaita, Vi·i<218><219><193>-dvaita ç
and Dvaita† and their variants.
By  the  by,  the  Upani<218>ads,  the Brahmas<220>tras and Bhagavadg<200>t<193> ç
have been considered by the orthodox sections of Hinduism as the three ç
foundational works of Ved<193>nta philosophy (technically called prasth<193>natraya).
One doctrine on which all these schools of philosophy are agreed upon ç
is that of karma and rebirth. As you sow, so you reap. This principle ç
when extended to the moral and spiritual field, becomes the doctrine ç
of karma. A person is free to do good or bad deeds in life. Accordingly ç
he will also get good or bad results. The intensity of such deeds ç
may be such that the results cannot be exhausted in one life. Hence ç
one has to admit of future births. This fact has been accepted in ç
the Hindu scriptures.
@SPACE = 
@SB = The Religion
@SPACE = 
Religion is applied philosophy. Hindu philosophical systems†especially ç
the Ved<193>nta†accept two things, viz., that God is one but can manifest ç
himself through various names and forms; and that God- realisation ç
is the final goal of life which gives infinite bliss and puts an end ç
to sa<221>s<193>ra or transmigration.
Broadly speaking, this can be achieved either through the j<210><193>nam<193>rga ç
(the path of knowledge) or through the bhaktim<193>rga (the path of ç
devotion). In the former one has to contemplate on one's <193>tman ç
or the Self through the process of elimination, that he is not the ç
body-mind complex but the soul, of pure consciousness and bliss. In ç
the latter, the seeker has to meditate on any aspect of God with faith ç
and devotion, and to repeat the mantra (the divine name of that aspect) ç
duly received from a competent guru (spiritual preceptor).
The various deities of the Hindu pantheon like Brahm<193>, Vi<218><207>u ç
and <185>iva† the Hindu Trinity †or their manifestations like the ç
ten avat<193>ras (incarnations, R<193>ma, K<216><218><207>a and others) ç
or other associated deities like the Dev<200> (Divine Mother) or Ga<207>apati, ç
are all different manifestations of the one Supreme God called `Brahman' ç
in the philosophical works. Even as sugar-dolls, though with various ç
names and forms, give the same sweet taste when eaten, meditation ç
on any of these deities will also give the same superconscious   mystical   experience, ç
experience of unalloyed bliss.
The particular forms of the deities and their mantras (mystical formulae) ç
to be used inmeditation have been handed over to us by a galaxy of ç
saints and seers. They have been well-tested over the centuries. They ç
are very much in vogue even today.
@SPACE1 = 
This takes us to an allied topic, that of Hindu temples and image-worship. ç
As already pointed out in the introduction, Hinduism is not idolatry. ç
It is worshipping God in and through the idol. The idol, sculptured ç
as per the directions given in the M<220>rti·ilpa·<193>stra or iconography, ç
is an aid to internal meditation. In the process of spiritual evolution, ç
the mind is raised from the idol to the living form of the deity in ç
one's heart and ultimately to the universal beatific presence of the ç
Divine.
Apart from the images, certain non-anthropomorphic icons or symbols ç
like the ·ivali<209>ga, the ·<193>lagr<193>ma, the ·r<200>cakra and ç
yantras, are also in vogue in Hinduism for purposes of worship.
If God is omnipotent and omni- present, nothing prevents him from ç
manifesting himself in the idol in a subtle form. It is this conviction ç
that has led to the ceremonial consecration of images in the Hindu ç
temples, making them `alive' as it were. Then, even the formal ritualistic ç
worship of the idols becomes legitimate. That many a Hindu saint has ç
scaled great spiritual heights by contemplation on these divine forms ç
or even by the worship of consecrated idols is proof enough, of this ç
principle.
If the Christians kneel before the crucifix, the Muslims kiss the ç
K<193>ba stone, the Sikhs worship their Book (the °di Granth), the ç
Jains and Buddhists worship their images, or for that matter, a patriot ç
salutes the national flag, there is no reason why a devout Hindu should ç
not worship his images.
Two more aspects of Hindu religious practices need mention here: celebration ç
of festivals and visiting the places of pilgrimage.
@SPACE1 = 
Festivals are occasions for exercising greater self-control through ç
fasting, keeping vigil and special worship of God. They are also occasions ç
of joy†once the religious vows are over†feasting and family/social ç
reunions.
Visiting places of pilgrimage†especi-ally the places surcharged with ç
the spiritual power by the association of great saints† will help ç
in therecharging as it were, of one's spiritual aspirations.
It should be noted that visiting places of worship, observing religious ç
festivals and going on a pilgrimage are common to almost all the religions ç
of the world.
It will not be out of place to mention here that the Hindu religious ç
works which advocate rituals or pilgrimage are also bold enough to ç
declare that the best worship is the worship of the Supreme Self within ç
and the best pilgrimage is resorting to the God in one's own heart!
It is necessary to state here another important doctrine of Hinduism, ç
that of avat<193>ra or incarnation of God in the human, or even non-human, ç
form. As per this doctrine, God incarnates Himself on this earth wheneverdharmadeclines ç
andadharma (unrighteousness) is on the ascendant, to restore the ç
balance. This he may do by punishing or destroying the wicked and ç
protecting the good through whom alone dharma can survive and thrive. ç
For God incarnating Himself thus, there are no limitations of time ç
or place or number.
@SPACE1 = 
Now a word about the ma<219>has or religious institutions. There are ç
innume-rable of them all over India (and even in foreign countries) ç
catering to the spiritual needs of their followers. The pontiffs of ç
these institutions have kept alive the spirit of their religion and ç
culture through their lives and propaganda. Some of them likethe ç
Ma<219>has established by <185>a<209>kara (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 788-820) ç
have a history spread over several centuries.
@SB = The Society
In spite of constant invasions from outside or battles among the various ç
rulers inside, the Hindu society has successfully maintained remarkable ç
stability, both at the family level and at the social level. This ç
is not a little due to the puru<218><193>rtha principle, the var<207>a ç
system and the <193>·rama scheme of life. Whenever they have been ç
understoodrightly andimplemented properly, they have acted as ç
a bulwark against the unsettling conditions or factors.
The puru<218><193>rthas (ends to be striven for in life) are four: ç
dharma (righteousness), artha (wealth), k<193>ma (desires) and mok<218>a ç
(liberation).
Hinduism permits the acquisition of wealth and the enjoyment of the ç
legitimate pleasures of life. But they should always be within the ç
perimeters of dharma, the greatest good of the greatest number. Since ç
the enjoyment of the pleasures of the flesh can never give satiation ç
or ultimate satisfaction, the human being†if he has been trained properly ç
in the true values of life†will gradually develop spiritual aspirations ç
and strive for mok<218>a, freedom from transmigratory existence.
@SPACE1 = 
For the successful implementation of this, the <193>·rama scheme of ç
life gives it a concrete shape. The var<207>a system offers it an ç
organisational structure to work it out.
The four <193>·ramas are: brahmacarya (student-hood), g<193>rhasthya ç
(state of a householder), v<193>naprastha (life of a forest recluse) ç
and sa<221>ny<193>sa (monastic life).
Brahmacarya, the first stage, is the period of education and training, ç
usually spread over twelve years from the age of seven. G<193>rhasthya ç
is the married state when the person is expected to raise a family ç
and discharge his <216><207>as or debts to the gods, the forefathers ç
and the society. Being the sole earning member, the householder is ç
the kingpin of the entire social structure. When the householder attains ç
the age of 50 or 55, he is expected to retire into the forest for ç
a life of contemplation, after handing over his responsibilities to ç
his eldest son. Around the age of 60 he is to renounce everything ç
and take to the life of a parivr<193>jaka (peripatetic monk), devoting ç
the entire time for spiritual pursuits.
The pursuit of the four puru<218><193>rthas by the individual, needs ç
the security of a proper social set-up. This is provided by the var<207>a ç
system. In the early Vedic society, there seems to have been a natural ç
division of labour based more on the inborn abilities and propensities. ç
Those of the intellectual type, who followed the principle of simple ç
living and high thinking, took upon themselves the task of acquisition ç
and distribution of knowledge and wisdom. They were called `br<193>hma<207>as'. ç
Those who were physically strong and tough chose to dedicate their ç
life for protec- ting the society from external aggression and maintain ç
internal law and order. They took to arms and became the `k<218>attriyas'. ç
A large majority of people engaged themselves in economic pursuits, ç
in the acquisition and distribution of wealth and goods. They were ç
known as the `vai·yas'. The rest contented themselves in supplying ç
manual  labour  for  all  the  other threesections. They were designated ç
as the `·<220>dras'.
As the society grew in size and complexity, the var<207>a system was ç
gradually metamorphosed into the j<193>ti system or the caste system ç
since it was easier and more natural for a person to adopt the calling ç
of the forefathers than seek a new one. Heredity, thus, became a working ç
principle.
The very fact that the caste system has survived for millennia shows ç
that there must be something worthwhile and useful in it. Any person ç
born in a parti- cular caste feels a sense of belonging to that group ç
of society which gives him psychological security. It also helps him ç
to learn the hereditary trade natural to his caste and practise it ç
without unhealthy competition. Endogamous marriage system unites the ç
members of the caste into a well-knit group who can come to one another's ç
rescue in times of need.
Allied to the caste system is the problem†call it a blot†of untouchability. ç
What started originally as temporary segregation of persons due to ç
certain biological or ritual conditions, or, permanent segregation ç
due to reasons of public health and sanitation†as in the case ofthose ç
engaged in certain abominable professions† became a lasting feature ç
and was gradually extended to more sections of the community, to the ç
detriment of the society as a whole. This development has nothing ç
to do with Hinduism as such, but only due to the inborn weaknesses ç
and prejudices of human beings in general. Such prejudices have existed ç
in all societies throughout the history of mankind.
Here, we can dilate a little, on the statusand condition of women ç
in India. During the Vedic age they were given a high place in the ç
society. The mention of women sages like V<193>c, Ambh<216><207><200>, ç
Roma·<193> and G<193>rg<200> in the Vedic lore corroborates this view. ç
Women could undergo the upanayana sacrament and pursue Vedic studies. ç
Those who chose this path were called `brahmav<193>din<200>s.' The ç
others who did not pursue this path but chose to enter into the married ç
life straight-away, were called `sadyovadh<220>s.' Co-education seems ç
to have existed in the earlier period. K<218>attriya ladies got training ç
in the use of arms andother martial arts. Both kany<193>viv<193>ha ç
(marriage of a pre-puberty girl arranged by her parents) and prau<195>haviv<193>ha ç
(marriage after attaining puberty) were prevalent. Under certain circumstances, ç
the girl had the freedom to choose her husband.
@SPACE1 = 
The wife known as `g<216>hi<207><200>' was considered as `half' of ç
the husband and constituted the real `g<216>ha' or home. She was called ç
`s<193>mr<193>j<210><200>' (the queen or the mistress of the home) ç
and had an equal share in the performance of religious rites.
Divorce and remarriage of women were allowed under very special conditions.
Shaving of the hair and wearing red saries by the widows or their ç
committing sahagamana (dying on the funeral pyre of their dead husbands) ç
was never compulsory. On the other hand, the elders in the society ç
had always tried to prevent sahagamana. The former custom seems to ç
have been confined to a small section of the br<193>hma<207>as, that ç
too in South India. The idea, perhaps, was that their life should ç
be similar to that of the sa<221>ny<193>sins.
It is interesting to note that ve·y<193>s (prostitutes) were allowed ç
to make a living, in the society, but were regulated by a code of ç
conduct specially made for them!
The devad<193>s<200>-system (devad<193>s<200> = a girl or a woman ç
`married' to the God in a temple and expected to spend her life as ç
his servant-maid) seems to be a later development.
@SPACE = 
@SB = The Way of Life
@SPACE = 
Hinduism is sometimes dubbed as `a way of life', and not a religion. ç
It is better to have a way of life that helps one to elevate oneself ç
and be useful to the society, than have a religion that makes an individual ç
dogmatic and the society anti other societies!
Actually Hinduism is a comprehensive system that incorporates in itself ç
all aspects of human life: philosophy, religion, ethics, all facets ç
of culture including the various arts, sciences and literature.
If life has to flow smoothly, it must have a smooth way to course ç
through. And, Hinduism has provided this through theprinciple of ç
s<193>m<193>nya-dharmas (ethical values common to all) and the institution ç
of sa<221>sk<193>ras (sacraments). The s<193>m<193>nya-dharmas train ç
a person to tunehis life to be in harmony with the society whereasthe ç
sa<221>sk<193>ras prepare him to refine his own life.
The s<193>m<193>nya-dharmas are: ahi<221>s<193> (non-violence), satya ç
(speaking the truthand keeping up one's word), asteya (non-stealing), ç
day<193> (compassion), titik<218><193> (forbearance), vinaya (humility), ç
indriya- nigraha  (restraining  the  senses,  self- control), ·<193>nti ç
(keeping the mind at peace), ·auca (purity of body), tapas (austerity) ç
and bhakti (devotion to God).
Thesa<221>sk<193>ras, whichexercisea subtlepurifying and refining ç
effect on the psychic personality, are sixteen. However, only six ç
are in vogue even today and may, therefore, be considered as important. ç
They are: j<193>takarma, n<193>makara<207>a, anna-pr<193>·ana, upanayana, ç
viv<193>ha and antye<218><219>i.
J<193>takarma, performed as soon as the baby is born, is aimed at ç
giving it a long life, good health and intelligence.
N<193>makara<207>a is the ceremonial act of naming the baby, generally ç
performed on the 10th or the 12th day after birth. The name chosen ç
is usually that of a god or a goddess or a saint.
Annapr<193>·ana is feeding the child for the first time with solid ç
food, normally in the seventh month. The food should have been consecrated ç
by ceremonially offering it to the family deity.
With upanayana begins a period of Vedic studies and spiritual discipline. ç
It indicates a second<192>spiritual<192>birth. Hence the name `dvija' ç
(twice-born) for anyone who  has  undergone  this  sacrament. Initiation ç
into the G<193>yatr<200> mantra and investiture with the yaj<210>opav<200>ta ç
(sacred thread) are the main items of this rite. The G<193>yatr<200>-mantra ç
is a universal prayer whereas the yaj<210>opav<200>ta is a symbol ç
which indicates to the boy that his life henceforward is dedicated ç
for the good of the society.
Viv<193>ha or marriage is considered cardinal among all the sacraments. ç
Since the g<216>hastha (the householder) is the supporter of the other ç
three <193>·ramas, his role has been eulogised highly. Kany<193>d<193>na ç
(gifting of the bride to the groom by the father of the girl) and ç
saptapad<200> (walking seven steps together) are the most important ç
parts of this sacrament.
Antye<218><219>i (the last sacrifice) is the last of the sacraments. ç
It is the consigning of the body of the dead person to the fire after ç
death. This is performed by the relatives of the deceased. The ashes ç
are generally disposed off in the waters of a river or sea and obsequial ç
rites†known as ·r<193>ddha†performed as directed by the scriptures.
Out of these sa<221>sk<193>ras, n<193>makara<207>a, viv<193>ha and ç
antye<218><219>i are common to all sections of the Hindu society, ç
though there may be variations in details.
@SB = The Culture
As stated in the foregoing pages, though Hinduism posits mok<218>a ç
or emancipation as the final goal of life, it does not advocate the ç
neglect of mundane life. Keeping this in mind, the Hindu scriptures ç
categorise vidy<193> or knowledge into two groups: par<193>vidy<193> ç
(spiritual wisdom) and apar<193>vidy<193> (secular sciences).
Whereas the former fulfils the ultimate purpose of life, the latter ç
embellishes life here and now. Hence both are needed by all.
The apar<193>vidy<193> has a large number of branches. The enumeration ç
of these rises sometimes to 64! These arts, crafts and sciences help ç
the human beings not only to beautify or refine their physique but ç
also sharpen their intellects and add to their external comforts.
A few of them may be listed here: vocal and instrumental music, dance ç
anddrama, making of flower-garlands, colouring of cloth, decorating ç
one's body, decoration of the house, water-sports, hair-dressing, ç
culinary arts, preparation of musical instruments, hand-writing, drawing ç
and painting, wood-work, metal filigree work, making of ornaments ç
of gold and precious stones, gardening, various types of physical ç
exercises and feats and so on.
Apart from these there were several other fields in which great progress ç
had been made by the ancient and medieval Hindus. Some of them were: ç
medicine andsurgery, veterinary sciences, military sciences including ç
the building of warships,   chemical   sciences   including alchemy, ç
astronomy and astrology, mining and metallurgy, and many others.
One characteristic feature of the basic works of all these sciences ç
is that they claim their origin from God himself and that their propagation ç
is for the benefit of the world as a whole!
That  Hindu religion, philosophy, mythology and culture had spread ç
to several parts of the world is now an established fact of history.
@SPACE = 
@SB = The Survival Instinct
@SPACE = 
`Survival of the fittest' is now a well- known adage. Hindu religion ç
and society have proved it over the millennia beyond all doubt.
@SPACE1 = 
However, this `fitness' in the case of Hinduism is not just biological. ç
It is psychological and cultural, firmly based onthe spiritual. ç
History is replete with instances of many an ancient civilisation ç
and culture disappearing totally, though they were powerful and hence ç
`fit' in the darwinian sense!
The secret of this survival instinct is the scientific spirit that ç
Hinduism has exhibited throughout its history. Every time there was ç
an upheaval, either from within or from without, it has responded ç
vigorously, intelligently and prudently. It is this inherent vitality ç
that is at the root of all the reform movements in Hinduism.
The sages of the Upani<218>adic age, were the forerunners of all the ç
reform movements. The religion of the <184>gveda which was simple ç
and elegant, had, by the period of the Br<193>hma<207>as, deteriorated ç
into a bewildering maze of sacrifices, which the common people could ç
not understand, let alone perform. So, these sages rejected them and ç
advocated meditation on and knowledge of the <193>tman as the essence ç
of our religion and thus saved it.
Lord <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a heralded the second reform movement. ç
He set at rest all disputes regarding the relative superiority of ç
j<210><193>na, karma or bhakti over one another and brought about ç
a balance and harmony among these various forms of spiritual disciplines.  His  greatest  contribution, ç
however, is his unambiguous declaration that one must perform one's ç
duty for duty's sake and contribute to the social well- being. His ç
continuously active life itself is  a  glorious  demonstration  of  his ç
philosophy.

The third reform movement was initiated by Mah<193>v<200>ra and Buddha ç
who banished dry and useless logic from the field of religion and ç
substituted it with simple, but life-giving, moral and ethical principles ç
which can give peace and joy, here and now.
However, when in course of time, their teachings were misunderstood ç
and misapplied, resulting in the desertion of Vedic religion by large ç
numbers, <185>a<209>kar<193>-c<193>rya appeared on the scene to resuscitate ç
and re-establish it. His was the fourth reform movement.
Then came a series of invasions by savage tribes, the impact of which ç
was felt both at the social and at the religious levels. It was at ç
this most critical period of our history that a series of great religious ç
and spiritual leaders like R<193>m<193>nuja, Madhva, Vallabha, Caitanya, ç
<185>a<209>karadeva, Basava, R<193>m<193>nanda, Kab<200>r, Tulas<200>d<193>s, ç
M<200>r<193>, Tuk<193>r<193>m, Purandarad<193>sa and scores of others ç
descended on our soil and protected our religion, culture and society ç
from the onslaughts of these alien hordes. But for these great and ç
noble souls who initiated the Bhakti Movements, Hinduism might have ç
all but disappeared from its own land. This was the fifth reform movement.
When we lost our freedom to the British during the nineteenth century, ç
a different kind of problem was created bythe planned import of cultural ç
and religious ideas from the West.As a reaction to this came the ç
sixth reform movement aiming at Hindu renaissance. R<193>j<193>R<193>mmohan ç
Roy, Sv<193>mi Day<193>nanda Sarasvat<200>, Mah<193>deva Govinda R<193>na<195>e, ç
Annie Besant, <185>r<200> R<193>mak<216><218><207>a Parama-ha<221>sa ç
and Sv<193>m<200> Vivek<193>nanda were the important leaders of this ç
movement. As aresult of their ceaseless, and even aggressive efforts, ç
San<193>tana Dharma, not only recovered its balance, but made inroads ç
into the bastions of Western culture and civilization. The movement ç
has gained further strength through the livesand works of Rama<207>a ç
Mahar<218>i, <185>r<200> Aurobindo and a series of spirituo-cultural ç
organizations.

@S10N = THE MALADIES
A society can progress well only when it stands on a firm base, on ç
a sound, time-tested, value system.
Fortunately,  the  religion  of  the Hindus has such a value system, ç
which has weathered many a storm and has stood the test of time!
But, unfortunately, the Hindu society, especially during the recent ç
past, has not risen to the heights necessary to deserve such a religion!
During its epic journey through the centuries, the Hindu society has ç
encountered many problems and difficulties. Some of these still continue, ç
may be in a modified form, may be in an acute form too. For instance, ç
the br<193>hma<207>a-priests do not wield that influence which they ç
exercised centuries ago though they still have their say in temples ç
and places of pilgrimage. But caste animosities including the practice ç
of untouchability, especially in rural India, are still rampant. Too ç
much emphasis on individual mukti or liberation has contributed to ç
a loosening of the social bonds.
The various kings who ruled different parts of this country with the ç
help of their mercenary armies and battled with other kings to fulfil ç
their personal ambitions prevented the rise of Indian nationalism.
The modern period, especially after political independence, has engendered ç
its own problems, thanks to the quantum jump in the modes of transportation ç
and means of communication. Infatuation with the glamour of the Western ç
nations has resulted in aping their customs and manners without imbibing ç
the better side of their culture. The tragedy is that this has often ç
been done at the cost of the old and time-tested values.Consequently, ç
God has been replaced by mammon! Other effects of this worship of ç
the mammon, especially since both the husband and the wife in a family ç
are often found working, are the loosening of the family bonds and ç
the consequent damage to the psyche of the children in the family. ç
Neglect of the aged is another aspect of the same problem.
@SPACE1 = 
Another factor which is engaging the attention of the thinking sections ç
of the Hindu   society   is†unfortunately†the aggressive  postures  adopted  by  some ç
religions  of  Semitic  origin  vis-a-vis Hinduism and Hindu society. ç
The self-righteous attitude of the representatives of these religions ç
and their refusal to have an honest dialogue with the Hindu leaders ç
is creating problems and tensions which can easily be avoided once ç
the real meaning  of  the  word  `conversion'  is understood. For ç
a Hindu, conversion is spiritual, a change from the brute level to ç
the human level and ultimately to the divine level. If conversion ç
is the result of proselytization which very often uproots a person's ç
cultural and national moorings nurtured over generations and if such ç
converted persons become anti-national and rebellous, no society worth ç
the name can tolerate it. Unfortunately, it is exactly this that is ç
happening, not only in India but also in many other†especially the ç
underdeveloped†countries.
The Hindu society being an open society and a soft target for the ç
aggressive propagators of these religions, is yet to learn and evolve ç
an effective antidote, to protect itself from their machinations.
@S10N = THE REMEDIES
The remedy for a weakness is not brooding over that weakness but meditating ç
upon the strength that can effectively offset it. Almost all the maladies ç
of the Hindu society stated earlier, are the results of weakness, ç
whether physical or intellectual or moral or spiritual.
First and foremost, the Hindus should develop `muscles of iron and ç
nerves of steel' (as Swami Vivek<193>nanda put it). This will help ç
themtoovercome their fear- psychosis and will engender a spirit ç
of adventure.
They should make an earnest study of the basics of their religion ç
and develop a righteous pride in belonging to such a great religion. ç
Hindu religious institutions and leaders should take thetrouble of ç
producing simple and easily understandable literature for the benefit ç
of the common masses. They should also utilize the modern methods ç
of mass communication for this purpose.
Serious efforts should be made to strengthen the internal bonds in ç
the family system. Genuine unselfish love for one- another, respect ç
for the elders, consideration for the aged, the infirm and the sick, ç
tenderness towards the young ones and giving them a sense of security, ç
decent and dignified behaviour towards the women†these are the traits ç
badly needed to be cultivated in every home.
The more advanced sections of the society whether in respect of education ç
or culture or wealth, should make special efforts to bring the backward ç
sections also to the same level of progress they themselves have achieved. ç
They must develop the attitude that the whole society is like a family ç
and that it is their duty to help others even as the elders in a family ç
help the youngsters with affection. Otherwise, there is the grim prospect ç
of the weaker sections, exploited and oppressed over the centuries, ç
leaving the Hindu society for good. The responsibility for this would ç
then squarely rest on the shoulders of the advanced sections!
@SPACE1 = 
Those who had left the Hindu fold, either due to ignorance or ill-treatment, ç
should be welcomed back into the fold with love, and given due recognition, ç
status and protection.
Though the caste system has worked well over several centuries, imparting ç
stability to the Hindu society, in modern India it is leading to many ç
unhealthy trends such as casteism at the cost of Hinduism.
Since the constitution of free India gives full freedom to everyone ç
to choose any profession or any way of life within the frame-work ç
of the law of the land, the very basis of the old caste system has ç
been knocked off. Hence, those who preach or practise or nurture casteism ç
should be considered as enemies of Hinduism and the Hindu society.
If persons of a particular caste (based on birth) want to preserve ç
their traditions, they are free to do so within their group. But, ç
outside, they must subscribe to and practise the general principles ç
of Hinduism and Hindu consciousness.
There is an urgent need to give a new look to the Hindu society, to ç
make it more homogeneous, or at least, more united. In this context, ç
evolving a few simple sa<221>sk<193>ras common to all the Hindus, ç
which can make every Hindu feel he is a Hindu and belongs to a great ç
brotherhood, is amust. Heads of the various  ma<219>has  (monasteries),  Hindu ç
religious sects and denominations should put theirheads together ç
in this regard.
Other programmes which may help in `Hinduising' the Hindus (if such ç
a word can be used) are: regularly visiting temples once every week, ç
group bhajans or prayers, conducting religious sacraments like upa-nayana ç
or marriage or rituals like Satya-n<193>r<193>ya<207>a-p<220>j<193>s ç
for large groups either in temples or dharma·<193>l<193>s, meaningful ç
celebrations of Hindu festivals with large public participation avoiding ç
the irreverent aberrations as seen sometimes in the religious processions ç
as those of Ga<207>apati or Durg<193>, more vigorous religious propaganda ç
using all the modern means of communication and so on.
@SB = Epilogue
Hinduism appears to many as a jigsaw puzzle. But, if one knows where ç
to put the pieces, not only is the puzzle easily solved, but also ç
gives rise to a beautiful picture.
Hinduism is a religion because: It accepts the existence of God ç
and posits him as the final goal of our life. It places before us ç
many paths that suit persons of different temperaments, but leading ç
to the same beatific experience of that God.
It gives the moral and ethical disciplines that help a human being ç
to purify
