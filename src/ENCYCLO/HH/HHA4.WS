It provides enough scope and opportu-nity for its adherents to get ç
emotional satisfaction through its rituals and festivals.
It recognises the shortcomings of the powers of the human intellect ç
in matters spiritual and experiential, and hence gives due recognition ç
to the revealed word of God, the Vedas.
Following the maxim that the same cap cannot fit everybody, it gives ç
different modes and methods of s<193>dhan<193>s or spiritual disciplines ç
to aspirants of different temperaments.
It makes the life of even a tyro or an average votary colourful and ç

of which has a solid philosophical basis too, capable of elevating ç
the person spiritually.
Hinduism is a philosophy because: It has given, through a rational ç
analysis and in a convincing manner, a knowledge about the ultimate ç
truths behind man and the universe, as also the final goal and the ç
path.
It has given freedom of thinking and expression to all schools and ç
sub-schools of thought, though they may not agree among themselves. ç
Differences of opinions are  respected  whereas  the  spiritual seekers ç
are given the full liberty to opt for any one of them.
Hinduism is a culture because:
It encourages all aspects of culture like music, dancing, drawing, ç
sculpturing, and other arts, but as reflecting the glory of the divine ç
and also as aids to spiritual evolution, if the right attitude is ç
adopted.
Hinduism isboth ancientand modern, ancient in its eternal value- ç
system, but modern in that it is always open to new ideas and everready ç
to replenish its treasure-house of knowledge, wisdom and virtues.
Hinduism has survived the vicissitudes of history and onslaughts ç
of time, exactly because of the various factors mentioned above.
The  least  that  such  a  religion deserves is a sympathetic study ç
of its tenets that will go a long way in understanding it.

History of mankind has shown that man cannot live without God. `If ç
God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him!' declared ç
Voltaire (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1694-1778). Belief in God, in a cosmic Power ç
or cosmic Law, in a superhuman Spirit or Being is basic to all cultures. ç
It is as it were, in the very blood of mankind. Once this fact is ç
recognised, it becomes irrelevant whether this belief has been brought ç
about by man's awe, wonder and fear of the powers of nature, or by ç
the teachings of god-men who are supposed to have had mystical experiences ç
of that God.
Man is human and not divine! This is so, at least, as long as he is ç
conscious of his frailties and impulses. It is exactly because of ç
this that he turns towards the Divine in times of need. Though the ç
Divine transcends all temporal limitations, man the human, needs a ç
temporal set-up that can help him to visualise the Divine or establish ç
contact with it. This is precisely where a symbol or an image or a ç
place of worship comes to his rescue.
All religions have their sacred places, places of worship. All words ç
which denote such places of worship, etymologically speaking, mean ç
more or less, the same thing. `Dev<193>laya' means a `house of God'. ç
`Temple' and `Synagogue' mean a `building for religious exercises' ç
and a `house for communal worship'. A `Church' also means the same ç
thing. A `Masjid' is a `place of prostration before God'.

@SB = 2.	A Brief History of Hindu Temples
@SPACE = 
How and when the first temple took its birth is anybody's guess. Temples ç
do not seem to have existed during the Vedic age. The practice of ç
preparing images of the deities mentioned in the Vedic mantras might ç
have come into vogue by the end of the Vedic period. The view that ç
y<193>ga·<193>l<193> of the Vedic period gradually got metamorphosed ç
into temples by the epic period owing to the influence of the cults ç
of devotion is widely accepted.
The earliest temples were built with perishable materials like timber ç
and clay. Cave-temples, temples carved out of stone or built with ç
bricks came later. Heavy stone structures with ornate architecture ç
and sculpture belong to a still later period.
Considering the vast size of this country (India), it is remarkable ç
that the building of temples has progressed more or less on a set ç
pattern. This is because there is a basic philosophy behind the temple, ç
its meaning and significance, which will be explained later.
In spite of the basic pattern being the same, varieties did appear, ç
gradually leading to the evolution of different styles in temple architecture. ç
Broadly speaking, these can be bifurcated into the northern and the ç
southern styles. The northern style, technically called n<193>gara, ç
is distinguished by the curvilinear towers. The southern style, known ç
as the dr<193>vi<195>a, has its towers in the form of truncated pyramids. ç
A third style, vesara by name, is sometimes added, which combines ç
in itself both these styles.
@SPACE1 = 
The earliest temples in north and central India which have withstood ç
the vagaries of time belong to the Gupta period, 320-650 <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
Mention may be made of the temples at Sanchi, Tigawa (near Jabbalpur ç
in Madhya Pradesh), Bhumara (in Madhya Pradesh), Nachna (Rajasthan) ç
and Deogarh (near Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh).
Among the earliest surviving temples in South India are those found ç
in Tamil Nadu and northern Karnataka. The cradle of Dravi<195>an school ç
of architecture was the Tamil country which evolved from the earliest ç
Buddhist shrines which were both rock-cut and structural. The later ç
rock-cut temples which belong roughly to the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
500-800 were mostly Br<193>hmanical or Jain, patronised by three great ç
ruling dynasties  of  the  south,  namely  the Pallavas of K<193><210>c<200> ç
in the east, the C<193>lukyas of B<193>d<193>mi in the west and the ç
P<193><207><195>yas of Madurai in the far south. With the decline ç
of the C<193>lukyas of B<193>d<193>mi in the 8th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>, ç
the R<193><218><219>rak<220><219>as of Malkhed came to power and they ç
made great contributions to the development of south Indian temple ç
architecture. The Kail<193>san<193>tha temple at Ellora belongs to ç
this period.
@SPACE1 = 
In the west (northern Karnataka) the Aiho<202>e and Pa<219><219>adakal ç
group of temples (5th to 7th centuries <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) show early attempts ç
to evolve an acceptable regional style based on tradition. Among the ç
better known early structural temples at Aiho<202>e are the Huchimalligu<195>i ç
and Durg<193> temples as also the L<193><195>kh<193>n temple, all ç
assigned to  the  period  <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 450-650.  Equally important ç
are the temples of K<193>·<200>n<193>tha, P<193>pan<193>tha, Sa<209>game·vara, ç
Vir<220>p<193>k<218>a and others in Pa<219><219>adakal near Aiho<202>e ç
as also the Svargabrahm<193> temple at °lampur (Andhra Pradesh). It ç
is in some of these temples, built by the later C<193>lukyas, that ç
we come across the vesara style, a combination of the northern and ç
the southern modes.
There are many ancient texts laying down the formal architectural ç
styles prevalent in the various regions so that the comprehensive ç
text called the V<193>stu <185><193>stra has its sources in the s<220>tras, ç
pur<193><207>as and <193>gamas besides T<193>ntric literature and ç
the B<216>hat Sa<221>hit<193>. But all of them are agreed that basically ç
styles can be divided into n<193>gara, dr<193>vi<195>a and vesara. ç
They employ respectively the square, octagon and the apse or circle ç
in their plan. In its later evolution when the vesara style adopted ç
the square for the sanctum, the circular or stellar plan was retained ç
for the vim<193>na. These three styles do not pertain strictly to ç
three different regions but as indicating only the temple groups. ç
The vesara, for instance, which came to prevail mostly in western ç
Deccan and south Karnataka was a derivation from the apsidal chapels ç
of the early Buddhist period which the Br<193>hmanical faith adopted ç
and vastly improved. In its origin, the vesara is as much north Indian ç
as it is west Deccanese. Similarly among the 6th-7th century shrines ç
of Aiho<202>e and Pa<219><219>adakal we find evidence of n<193>gara ç
style in the pr<193>s<193>das or vim<193>nas. The dr<193>vi<195>a ç
or Tamilian style became very popular throughout south India only ç
from the Vijayanagar times onward. While the pr<193>s<193>da or vim<193>na ç
of the n<193>gara style rises vertically from its base in a curvilinear ç
form, that of the dr<193>vi<195>a rises like a stepped pyramid, tier ç
upon tier. The northern style came to prevail in Rajasthan, Upper ç
India, Orissa, the Vindhyan uplands and Gujarat.
@SPACE1 = 
During the next thousand years (from <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 600 to 1600) there ç
was a phenomenal growth in temple architecture both in quantity and ç
quality. The first in the series of southern or dr<193>vi<195>ian ç
architecture was initiated by the Pallavas (<MS>A.<|>D. <D>600-900). ç
The rock-cut temples at Mah<193>balipuram (of the `ratha' type) and ç
the structural temples like the shore temple at Mah<193>balipuram ç
and the Kail<193>san<193>tha and Vaiku<207><219>ha Perum<193><202> ç
temples in K<193><210>c<200>puram (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 700-800) are the ç
best representatives of the Pallava style. The Pallavas laid the foundations ç
of the dr<193>vi<195>ian school which blossomed to its full extent ç
during the periods of the Co<202>as, the P<193><207><195>yas, the ç
Vijayanagar kings and the N<193>yakas. The temples, now built of stone, ç
became bigger, more complex and ornate with sculptures. Dr<193>vi<195>ian ç
architecture reached its glory during the Co<202>a period (<MS>A. ç
D.<D> 900-1200) by becoming more imposing in size and endowed with ç
happy proportions. Among the most beautiful of the Co<202>a temples ç
is the B<216>had<200>·vara temple at Tanjore with its 66 metre (218ft.) ç
high vim<193>na, the tallest of its kind. The later P<193><207><195>yans ç
who succeeded the Co<202>as improved on the Co<202>as by introducing ç
elaborate ornamentation and big sculptural images, many-pillared halls, ç
new annexes to the shrine and towers (gopurams) on the gateways. The ç
mighty temple complexes of Madurai and <185>r<200>ra<209>gam in Tamil ç
Nadu set a pattern for the Vijayanagar builders (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1350-1565) ç
who followed the dr<193>vi<195>ian tradition. The Pamp<193>pati and ç
Vi<219><219>hala temples in Hampi are standing examples of this period. ç
The N<193>yaks of Madurai who succeeded the Vijayanagara kings (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1600 to 1750) made the dr<193>vi<195>ian temple complex even more ç
elaborate by making the gopurams very tall and ornate and,adding ç
pillared corridors within the temple's long compound.
@SPACE1 = 
Contemporaneous with the Co<202>as (<MS>A.D. <D>1100-1300), the Hoysa<202>as ç
who ruled the Kannada country, improved on the C<193>lukyan style ç
by building extremely ornate temples in many parts of Karna-taka noted ç
for the sculptures in the walls, depressed ceilings, lath-eturned ç
pillars and fully sculptured vim<193>nas (domes). Among the most famous ç
of these temples are the ones at Belur, Halebid and Somanatha-pura ç
in South Karnataka, which are classified under the vesara style.
@SPACE1 = 
In the north, the chief developments in Hindu temple architecture ç
took place in Orissa (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 750-1250) and Central India (<MS>A.<|>D. ç
<D>950-1050) as also Rajasthan (10th and 11th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) ç
and Gujarat (11th-13th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>). The temples of Li<209>gar<193>ja ç
(Bhubaneshwar), Jagann<193>tha (Pur<200>) and S<220>rya (Konarak) ç
represent the Orissan style. The temples at Khajuraho built by the ç
Chandellas, the S<220>rya temple at Modhera (Gujarat) and other temples ç
at Mt. Abu built by the Sola<209>kis have their own distinct features ç
in Central Indian architecture. Bengal with its temples built in bricks ç
and terracotta tiles and Kerala with its temples having peculiar root ç
structure suited to the heavy rainfall of the region, developed their ç
own localised special styles.
Mention may also be made here of the various Hindu Temples outside ç
India, especially in the South East Asian countries. The earliest ç
of such Hindu temples are found in Java; for instance, the <185>iva ç
temples at Dieng and idong Songo built by the kings of <185>ailendra ç
dynasty (8th-9th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>). The group of temples of Lara ç
Jonggrang at Pranbanan (9th or 10th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>), is a magnificent ç
example of Hindu temple architecture. Other temples worth mentioning ç
are: the temple complex at Panataran (Java) built by the kings of ç
Majapahit dynasty (14th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>), the rock-cut temple ç
facades at Tampaksiring of Bali (11th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>), the ç
`mother' temple at Besakh of Bali (14th century <MS>A.D.<D>), the ç
Chen La temples at Sambor Prei Kuk in Cambodia (7th-8th century <MS>A.D.<D>), ç
the temple of Banteay Srei at Angkor (10th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) ç
and the celebrated Angkor Vat complex (12th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) ç
built by S<220>rya Varman II.
@SB = 3.	Symbology of the Temple
The temple is a link between man and God, between the earthly life ç
and the divine life, between the actual and the ideal. As such it ç
has got to be symbolic.
The word `dev<193>laya' which is frequently used to denote a temple, ç
actually means `the house of God'. It is the place where God dwells ç
on earth to bless mankind. It is His house, His place. In fact, there ç
is another word to denote a temple, `Pr<193>s<193>da,' which means ç
a palace with a very pleasing appearance. When looked at this way, ç
the dhvajastambha represents the flagpost on which flies the insignia ç
of the deity. The outer walls, pr<193>k<193>ra, are the walls of the ç
fort. The gopuram (high tower at the entrance) is the main gateway.
`Vim<193>na' is another word which is often used to denote a temple ç
in general, and the garbhag<216>ha (sanctum sanctorum) in particular. ç
The simple etymological meaning is a `well-proportioned structure'. ç
As an extension of this meaning derived from the root-verb m<193> ç
(= to measure), it signifies God the Creator, as a combination of ç
<185>iva and <185>akti, who `measures out' as it were, this limited ç
universe from out of Himself, the unlimited principle. It further ç
means an aeroplane. It is the aeroplane of gods landed on earth to ç
bless mankind.
Pilgrimage has an important place in the Hindu religion. A place of ç
pilgrimage is called a t<200>rtha (= means) and is invariably associated ç
with a temple. Hence the temple is called a t<200>rtha. The temple ç
helps us as a means of crossing the ocean of sa<221>s<193>ra (transmigratory ç
existence).
@SPACE1 = 
Even more significant is the conception that its plan and elevation. ç
Horizontally the garbhag<216>ha represents the head and the gopuram ç
the feet of the deity. Other parts of the building complex are identified ç
with other parts of the body. For instance, the ·ukan<193>s<200> (also ç
spelledas sukhan<193>si or sukan<193>s<200>) or ardhama<207><195>apa ç
(the small enclosure in front of the garbhag<216>ha) is the nose; ç
the antar<193>la (the passage next to the previous one, leading to ç
the main ma<207><195>apa called n<216>tta-ma<207><195>apa) is the ç
neck (In many temples the antar<193>la is merged with the ·ukan<193>s<200> ç
itself andnot built separately.); the various man<195>apas are the ç
body; the pr<193>k<193>ras (surrounding walls) are the hands and so ç
on. Vertically, the garbhag<216>ha represents the neck, the ·ikhara ç
(superstructure over the garbha-g<216>ha) the head, the kala·a (finial) ç
the tuft of hair (·ikh<193>) and so on.
The temple also represents God in a cosmic form, with the various ç
worlds located on different parts of his body. Thebh<220>loka (earth) ç
forms his feet and satyaloka (also called Brahmaloka) forms his ·ikh<193> ç
(tuft of hair), with the other lokas (bhuvarloka, svarloka, maharloka, ç
janaloka and tapoloka) forming the appropriate parts of his body. ç
The ground represents bh<220>loka. The adhi<218><219>h<193>nap<200><219>ha ç
(the base-slab below the image), the stambhas (pillars), prastara ç
(entablature, supported  above  the  pillars),  ·ikhara (superstructure ç
over the garbhag<216>ha), <193>malas<193>ra (lower part of the finial) ç
and the st<220>pik<193> (topknot or the finial) represent respectively ç
the world bhuva<199>, sva<199>, maha<199>, jana<199>, tapa<199> and ç
satyam.
The temple also represents the Meruparvata the mythical golden mountain ç
described in the pur<193><207>as (Hindu mythological literature), ç
as the central point of the universe, round which (in all directions) ç
are spread the various worlds.
Again, the temple represents this world in all its aspects, the actual ç
and the ideal. The imposing gopurams at the entrance reflect the awesome ç
grandeur of the external world. The friezes and the sculptures on ç
the external walls of the temple proper, depict the animal world and ç
the mundane life of the ordinary human beings including the ridiculous ç
side and the aberrations.*
These are followed by the scenes from the epic and mythological literature ç
as also religious symbols and icons of gods and goddesses, to remind ç
the onlookers of our great cultural and spiritual heritage.
If the temple symbolises the body of God on the macrocosmic plane, ç
it equally symbolises the body of man on the microcosmic plane. The ç
names of the various parts of the temple are the very names used to ç
denote the various parts of human body! Look at the following technical ç
names: p<193>duk<193>, p<193>da, cara<207>a, a<209>ghri, ja<209>gh<193>, ç
<220>ru, gala, gr<200>va, ka<207><219>ha, ·ira, ·<200>r<218>a, kar<207>a, ç
n<193>sika, ·ikh<193>. P<193>da (foot) is the column, ja<209>gh<193> ç
(shank) is part of the superstructure over the base. Gala or gr<200>va ç
(neck) is the part between mouldings which resembles the neck. N<193>sik<193> ç
(nose) is any nose-shaped architectural part and so on. The garbhag<216>ha ç
represents the heart and the image, the antary<193>min (the indwelling ç
Lord). This symbology tries to impress upon us the need to seek the ç
Lord within our hearts and not outside.
The temple also represents the subtle body with the seven psychic ç
centres or cakras. The garbhag<216>ha represents the an<193>hata cakra ç
(the fourth psychic centre in the region of the heart) and the topmost ç
part of the kala·a points to the sahasr<193>ra (seventh and the last ç
centre situated at the top of the head). The first three centres (m<220>l<193>dh<193>ra, ç
sv<193>dhi<218><219><193>na and ma<207>ip<220>ra situated respectively ç
near the anus, sex-organ and navel) are below the ground level. The ç
fifth and the sixth (vi·uddha and <193>j<210><193> cakras, situated ç
at the root of the throat and in between the eyebrows) are on the ç
·ikhara area.
@SPACE1 = 
Very often, the ground-plan of a temple is a ma<207><195>ala. Hence ç
whatever interpretation is given to a ma<207><195>ala can also be ç
extended to the temple itself. A ma<207><195>ala is a geometrical ç
diagram with occult potentialities. Symmetry is its chief characteristic. ç
The created world which is the perfect handicraft of a perfect Creator, ç
can best be represented by a symmetrical and well-proportioned ma<207><195>ala. ç
The movement in the ma<207><195>ala, as far as the devotee is concerned, ç
is from the outer details to the centre, which is a point. The point ç
represents the one creative Principle, theDeity, from which everything ç
has evolved. The devotee has to start from outside, pass through circuitous ç
routes and successive stages to come to the centre. Similarly the ç
devotee who enters the temple has to pass through several gates, courtyards ç
and passages, leaving the grand externals, and progress towards the ç
garbhag<216>ha, the very heart of the temple complex, housing the ç
one cosmic Principle.
@SB = 4.	Construction of a Temple
Building of temples is considered to be an extremely pious act, bringing ç
great religious merit. Hence kings and rich people were eager to spend ç
their wealth on it. All the various steps involved in it were performed ç
either as religious rites or with religious overtones.
Let us now try to describe the typical steps commonly involved in ç
building a temple. The yajam<193>na (lit., the sacrificer; here, the ç
financier and builder) must first choose a proper guide or sth<193>paka ç
or <193>c<193>rya for overall guidance and super- vision. This <193>c<193>rya ç
must be a pious br<193>hma<207>a, with a sinless life. He must be ç
an expert in art, architecture and rituals. The <193>c<193>rya then ç
chooses the sthapati (chief architect) and puts him in charge of the ç
whole construction. The sthapati commands a status and respect equal ç
to that of the <193>c<193>rya. He is assisted by the s<220>tragr<193>hin ç
(surveyor), the tak<218>aka (sculptor) and the vardhakin (builder, ç
plasterer and painter).
@EMERGEN1 = From the day of sa<209>kalpa (religious resolve), the ç
yajam<193>na and the <193>c<193>rya have to take certain religious ç
vows and lead a very strict life in accordance with those vows.
The first and foremost step in the building of a temple is the selection ç
of a suitable site situated in or near a holy place and endowed with ç
natural beauty and peace. The site has then to be cleared of all its ç
vegetation. Evil spirits have to be exorcised and the place purified.
Assuming that the detailed designs and engineering drawings have already ç
been prepared, the next item is v<193>stuviny<193>sa, drawing the ç
v<193>stuma<207><195>ala on the site of the temple construction at ç
an appropriate auspicious time. The cosmic man embodying the whole ç
creation including the different deities of the Hindu pantheon in ç
the different limbs and parts of his body, is technically called the ç
`V<193>stu- puru<218>a'. The ma<207><195>ala is a geometrical drawing ç
of 64 squares which represents him. Once the v<193>stuma<207><195>ala ç
is drawn ceremonially, it becomes `alive', with the V<193>stupuru<218>a ç
fixed on it. Later, the image or the symbol of the deity will have ç
to be installed in the centre of this ma<207><195>ala at the appropriate ç
time.
Another important religious ceremony connected with the various stages ç
of construction is a<209>kur<193>rpa<207>a (rite of the seeds and ç
their germination). Its main purpose is to facilitate the fruition ç
of the work without obstructions and obstacles. It is performed before ç
the construction starts, before laying the last brick or stone (m<220>rdhe<218><219>ak<193>) ç
into the superstructure, prior to the installation of the main image,before ç
the `opening of the eyes' (ak<218>imocana) of the image and so on. ç
The rite consists of placing the seeds of different  varieties  of  rice,  sesamum, ç
mustard etc., in 16 copper vessels in front of Soma (the lord of germination) ç
and offering them to the concerned deity after germination.
@SPACE1 = 
Next comes ·il<193>ny<193>sa or foundation stone laying ceremony. ç
It is the laying of the first stone (square in shape) or brick signifying ç
the start of construction. It is laid in the north-western corner ç
of the building plan, drawn on the ground after excavating the foundation ç
to the required depth. After this, the construction of the foundation ç
is taken up.
The foundation is built and the ground filled up, up to the plinth ç
level, except in the middle portion of the garbhag<216>ha which is ç
filled up to three-fourths only. In the centre of this place, the ç
<193>dh<193>ra·il<193> (a base stone) is placed, over which are deposited ç
the following articles in that order: a pot (called nidhikumbha), ç
a tortoise and a lotus, all made of stone; a tortoise and a lotus ç
made of silver; a tortoise and a lotus made of gold. From there, a ç
funnel-shaped tube called yogan<193>l<193>, made of copper leads upto ç
the plinth. The whole thing is covered by another stone-slab called ç
`brahma·il<193>'. Later on, the image of the deity is established ç
over this. This is called `<218>a<195><193>dh<193>ra prati<218><219>h<193>.'
Another extremely important rite which is performed during temple ç
construction is the garbhany<193>sa (`insemination' of the temple ç
site). A casket or tray of copper, whose dimensions are proportional ç
to the dimensions of the temple, is ceremonially lowered into the ç
ground on an auspicious night after filling its 25 squares with various ç
articles and duly worshipping it. It represents the Mother Earth and ç
the ceremony itself is done with a view to achieving the smooth consummation ç
of the temple project.
@SPACE1 = 
Materials used for construction like stones, bricks and wood should ç
be procured newly from their sources, for which also there are guidelines. ç
All the tools and implements used in the construction should be worshipped.
After the foundation is built up to the basement level, the superstructure ç
is built either with pillars or with walls or a combination of both. ç
Doors, openings, niches, windows and porches with suitable decorations ç
are added at the appropriate stages, ending finally with the ·ikhara ç
(the crest or the finial).
The most important part of temple construction is the preparation ç
and installation of the image of the main deity as also the images ç
of the subsidiary deities.
@SB = 5.	Essential Parts<|>of A Typical Temple
The most important part of a temple, its very heart as it were, is ç
the garbhag<216>ha or sanctum sanctorum. This is usually square ç
with a low roof and with no doors or windows except for the front ç
opening. The image of the deity is stationed in the geometrical centre. ç
The whole place is completely dark, except for the light that comes ç
through the front opening. Over the roof of the whole shrine is a ç
small tower. This tower is quite high in the North Indian temples ç
and of low or medium height in the South Indian temples.
In some temples, a pradak<218>i<207>apatha (a circumambulatory passage) ç
is provided just round the garbhag<216>ha, to enable the devotees ç
to go round the deity. Only vesara temples do not have this passage.
In front of the garbhag<216>ha and contiguous to it is the mukhama<207><195>apa, ç
sometimes called `·ukan<193>s<200>' or `ardha-ma<207><195>apa', depending ç
upon its proportion relative to that of the garbhag<216>ha. Apart ç
from being used as a passage, it is also used to keep the articles ç
of worship including naivedya (food offerings) on special occasions.
Then comes antar<193>la, a narrow passage connecting the garbhag<216>ha ç
and the mukhama<207><195>apa to the ma<207><195>apa (pavilion or hall). ç
As already stated, in most of the temples the antar<193>la is identical ç
with mukhama<207><195>apa or ·ukan<193>s<200>.
The ma<207><195>apa (also called `n<216>tta-ma<207><195>apa' or `navara<209>ga') ç
is a big hall and is used for congregational religious acts like singing, ç
dancing, recitation of mythological texts, religious discourses and ç
so on.
The dhvajastambha (flagpost) in front of either the garbhag<216>ha ç
or antar<193>la or the ma<207><195>apa is another common feature. ç
It represents the flagpost of the `King of kings'. The l<193><210>chana ç
(insignia) made of copper or brass fixed like a flag to the top of ç
the post varies according to the deity in the temple. The figure on ç
the l<193><210>chana is invariably that of the v<193>hana (carrier ç
vehicle) of the deity. For instance, in <185>iva temples it contains ç
Nandi. In Dev<200>temples it is the Lion that finds its place. In ç
Vi<218><207>u temples Garu<195>a gets that honour.
The balip<200><219>ha (pedestal of sacrificial offerings) with a lotus ç
or the foot printsof the deity is fixed near the dhvajastambha, but ç
nearer to the deity. Red-coloured offerings like rice mixed with vermilion ç
powder, are kept on this at appropriate stages during the performance ç
of rituals. This indicates the feeding ofthe pariv<193>ra-devat<193>s ç
(attendant and associate deities).
There is every reason to believe that the y<220>pasta<221>bha (sacrificial ç
post) and the balip<200><219>ha (sacrificial pedestal) of the Vedic ç
age have become metamorphosed into the dhvajastambha and the balip<200><219>ha.
The whole temple is surrounded by a high wall (pr<193>k<193>ra) with ç
one main and three subsidiary gates, opening in the cardinal directions. ç
A gopuram (high tower, sometimes called as the Cow-gate) adorns these ç
gateways.
Inside the pr<193>k<193>ra, there will be minor temples or shrines ç
for other deities, connected with the main deity. For instance, in ç
a <185>iva temple, the minor shrines are dedicated to Ga<207>apati, ç
P<193>rvat<200>, Subrahma<207>ya and Ca<207><195>e·vara. In a Vi<218><207>u ç
temple, Lak<218>m<200>, Hanum<193>n and Garu<195>a find a place. In ç
a Durg<193> temple, <185>iva, Ga<207>apati and Subrahma<207>ya will ç
be found.
@SPACE1 = 
Apart from these, the temple precincts include a y<193>ga·<193>l<193> ç
(sacrificial shed), p<193>ka·<193>l<193> (cooking shed), place for ç
the utsavam<220>rti (processional image carried during the car-festivals), ç
well or a pu<218>kari<207><200> (tank), flower garden, stores and ç
other essential structures connected with the management of the temple ç
as also the rituals.
A d<200>pastambha (lamp-post) is another constituent of a temple complex ç
often found in South Indian temples. It is situated either in front ç
of the balip<200><219>ha or outside the main gate. The top of this ç
post has a budshaped chamber to receive the lamp.
@SPACE = 
@SB = 6.	Iconography
@SPACE1 = 
Since the whole temple is built to house the image of the deity, a ç
few words about Indian iconography (science of preparing the images) ç
will not be out of place here.
Indian iconography is a very ancient science and art. There are clear ç
references to images in the <184>gveda and to temples in the Atharvaveda. ç
Subsequent ancient works contain innumerable references to the same.
Broadly speaking, the images in the Hindu temples fall into three ç
groups: <185>aiva, <185><193>kta and Vai<218><207>ava, respectively ç
belonging to the three cults of <185>iva, <185>akti and Vi<218><207>u. ç
The images, again, can be acala or dhruvabera (immovable) or cala ç
(movable). The former are usually made of stone and are permanently ç
fixed. The latter are made of metals like bronze or pa<210>caloha ç
(alloy of five metals) and are used for taking out in procession on ç
festive occasions, for bathing, for ritualistic worship etc. Sometimes, ç
a third category, cal<193>cala (both movable and immovable) is added. ç
When the same image that is kept and worshipped in the grabhag<216>ha ç
is also taken out on the ratha (temple car)†as for instance in the ç
case of the temple of Lord Jagann<193>tha at Pur<200> (Orissa)†it ç
is called cal<193>cala.
Again, the images can be in three postures: sth<193>naka (standing), ç
<193>sana (sitting) and ·ay<193>na (laying down). Only images of Vi<218><207>u ç
are to be seen in the ·ay<193>na posture also.
The particular aspects of the deities represented by the images can ç
be recognised by seeing the mudr<193> (position of the hands and fingers), ç
<193>sana (posture of legs and feet), cinha (symbol), vasana (dress) ç
and <193>bhara<207>a (ornaments). Among the mudr<193>s and <193>sanas, ç
abhayamudr<193> (assuring protection), varadamudr<193> (granting boons), ç
padm<193>sana (lotus posture) and yog<193>sana (meditation posture) ç
are most common. <185>aiva and <185>akta images have <195>amaru (drum), ç
tri·<220>la (trident), p<193>·a (noose), a<209>ku·a (goad), b<193><207>a ç
(arrow), kha<195>ga (sword) and so on, as their symbols. Cakra (discus), ç
·a<209>kha (conch), gad<193> (mace) and padma (lotus) are more common ç
for Vai<218><207>ava images. As regards dress and ornaments, they ç
are too numerous to be mentioned.
There are elaborate rules guiding the sculpturing of images. The height ç
or length, width, girth as also the proportions of the various limbs†each ç
one of these is fixed according to the t<193>lam<193>na system. A ç
`t<193>la' is the measurement of the palm of hand (from the tip of ç
the middle finger to the wrist) and is equal to the length of the ç
face. The navat<193>la system wherein the total length or height of ç
the image is nine times (nava = nine) the length of the face, is recommended ç
for the images of gods.
In spite of all these rules and regulations the sculptor had freedom ç
to show his skill. A beautiful face with the expression of the appropriate ç
rasa (emotion or sentiment) was commended and recommended.
@SB = 7.	Religious Rites and Ceremonies
@S10 = a)	Consecration Ceremony (prati<218><219>h<193>vidhi):
Once the construction of a new temple is successfully completed, it ç
is to be formally consecrated with appropriate rites and ceremonies. ç
A separate shed is erected in the north-eastern corner of the main ç
structure wherein are performed all the important religious ceremonies.
Since the consecration is a very elaborate religious ceremony, only ç
the most important steps will be described. After the usual p<220>j<193> ç
and homa for the V<193>stupuru<218>a, nine balis (offerings) are given ç
to the minor (and usually fierce) deities, by placing the balis all-round ç
the temple and the deities are being requested to leave the place ç
permanently. Then the <193>c<193>rya, the yajam<193>na and their assistants ç
enter the y<193>ga·<193>l<193> and establish kala·as (ceremonial pots ç
filled with water, the number being up to a maximum of 32) all-round ç
the place. After certain preliminary rites, homas are performed in ç
the several homaku<207><195>as (1 or 5 or 9) to propitiate the main ç
deity of the temple and other associated deities.
Meanwhile, the image of the main deity, after the ceremonial opening ç
of its eyes (netronm<200>lana) will have been taken in the ratha (temple ç
car) to a nearby source of water like a river or a pond and immersed ç
in it for the first of the three `adhiv<193>sa' ceremonies (adhiv<193>sa ç
= abode), called `jal<193>dhiv<193>sa'. From there, after three days, ç
the image is brought in the ratha to the y<193>ga·<193>l<193> and ç
then put in grains for another three days (`dh<193>ny<193>dhiv<193>sa'). ç
It is then taken out and put on a specially prepared bed for three ç
days more (`·ayy<193>dhiv<193>sa').
In the centre of the garbhag<216>ha, a yantra (a gold plate with occult ç
designs), some precious stones and minerals as also some seeds are ç
placed.
Then comes a<218><219>abandha. Eight materials like conch, whitestone, ç
lac, perfume etc., are powdered nicely and mixed with butter or oil ç
to form a paste which is then put on the yantra and other materials ç
mentioned previously. Over this the image is fixed. This image is ç
then connected by a gold wire or a long thread, to the main homaku<207><195>a ç
in the y<193>ga·<193>l<193>. This is called `n<193><195><200>sandh<193>na' ç
whereby the n<193><195>is or internal passages will become opened ç
up as it were, to receive life. The deity is then invoked into the ç
image by pr<193><207>aprati<218><219>h<193> (a ceremony for infusing ç
life-force) and a simple worship is performed.
The main kala·a from the y<193>ga·<193>l<193> is then brought and ç
the image bathed with that water. This is called `kumbh<193>bhi<218>eka.' ç
It is then followed by elaborate worship, offerings and waving of ç
lights.
The <193>c<193>rya, the yajam<193>na, the sthapati and their assistants ç
will then take a ceremonial bath (called `avabh<216>tha-sn<193>na') ç
indicating thereby that they have successfully completed a great and ç
meritorious act.
Devotees and poor people of the place are then sumptuously fed.
@S10 = b)	Daily Worship (nityap<220>j<193>):
Once a temple is built and ceremonially consecrated, daily worship ç
must be done regularly. This daily worship can be done from a minimum ç
of once, up to a maximum of six times (before sunrise, after sunrise, ç
between 8 and 9 a.m., noon, evening and night). During each worship, ç
all the dress and ornaments of the deity should be removed and the ç
image should be bathed successively with oil, ghee, milk, water and ç
scented water. It should then be dressed again, smeared with sandal ç
paste and decorated with ornaments. Food articles should then be offered. ç
All these are done after closing the doors of the garbhag<216>ha. ç
After opening the doors, waving of lights and several upac<193>ras ç
(items of special service) are done, including chanting of hymns and ç
music.
Ceremonial worship is also done to the consort of the main deity and ç
minor deities associated with it.
@S10 = c)	Occasional Worship (naimittika-p<220>j<193>):
Worship done on special occasions like <185>ivar<193>tri, Vaiku<207><219>ha ç
Ek<193>da·<200> or Dasara is called `naimittika-p<220>j<193>.' This ç
worship differs from place to place, or even from temple to temple. ç
It is done in addition to the daily worship. Special homa, japa (repetition ç
of the divine name), abhi<218>eka (bathing the image) and elaborate ç
worship are its distinctive features. The utsavam<220>rti, meant to ç
be taken out in procession, will be well-decorated and exhibited to ç
the devotees.
@S10 = d)	Rathotsava and Brahmotsava:
On the special occasions mentioned above, religious celebrations may ç
be spread over a number of days. The biggest festival among these ç
is called `Brahmotsava' (Brahma = big). This is also called rathotsava ç
since the utsavam<220>rti is taken out in a procession in the temple ç
car. Beating the drum (bher<200>t<193><195>ana), hoisting the flag ç
of the deity (dhvaj<193>roha<207>a), inviting the deity to the y<193>ga·<193>l<193> ç
(<193>v<193>hana), establishing the kala·as and performing homa are ç
some of the more important aspects of the festival. The temple car ç
is taken out two days before the close of the festival. In some temples ç
where there are facilities of a river or a big tank, teppotsava (boat-festival) ç
is alsoperformed on the next day of the rathotsava.
Rathas being the replicas of temples, rathotsavas are very popular. ç
The whole ratha and the deity are elegantly decorated and the procession ç
with its music, lights, crackers and entertainment becomes very attractive. ç
Hundreds of devotees without any distinction of caste, creed or colour ç
draw the car, shoulder to shoulder. Devotees unable to go to the temple ç
due to any reason, can have the dar·an on their doorsteps and can ç
even offer their private worship.
@SPACE = 
@SB = 8.	Temple Arts and Crafts
@SPACE = 
Kings, as lords and masters of the country over which they rule, are ç
well-known for their encouragement to arts, crafts and artisans. The ç
temple which houses the King of kings, should not lag behind! That ç
is why we find the temples, especially the bigger ones, acting as ç
thebiggest employers and providing the greatest security and encouragement ç
to the artisans and artists. Apart from sculpturing  stone  images  or  casting ç
metallic ones, the other arts and crafts associated with the temples ç
can be listed as follows: music, dance, preparation of musical instruments, ç
embroidery work on cloth, tailoring, preparation of perfumes and scents, ç
making of flower-garlands, cooking of special dishes, astrology, building ç
the ratha, etching or embossing on metal plates used in various ways, ç
making of lamp-posts and stands as also p<220>j<193> vessels in brass, ç
bronze and copper, painting, gold and silver smithy, ivory-craft and ç
so on. Development of these crafts and their flourishing trade over ç
centuries are largely due to the temples.
@SB = 9.	The Temple and the Devotee
When we want to meet our superiors or persons highly placed in life, ç
we observe certain etiquette, norms and decorum. Therefore it is but ç
natural that the devotee who wants to visit the Lord of the universe ç
in a temple, is expected to observe a certain code of conduct. Taking ç
bath, wearing freshly washed clothes is a must. If and when possible, ç
this should be done in the Pu<218>kari<207><200> attached to the temple. ç
Entering the precincts of the temple, he should observe silence and ç
try to withdraw the mind into the thoughts of God. After having the ç
dar·an of the deity and getting his individual worship if any, performed, ç
he should circumambulate the main shrine three, five or seven times. ç
Then he should bow down to the deity from a place outside the dhvajastambha, ç
taking care to see that his feet do not point in the direction of ç
any of the minor deities. Visiting the shrines of the minor deities ç
is his next duty. Before leaving the precincts of the temple, he should ç
sit quietly in some corner and meditate. Since distribution of alms ç
to deserving beggars in the vicinity of the temple is considered meritorious, ç
the devotees are advised to do so.
Apart from these general rules to be observed by the devotee, he should ç
alsobe aware of daiv<193>pac<193>ras, modes of behaviour which will ç
offend the deity in the temple. This is very important because when ç
a temple is built and the image consecrated ceremonially, the power ç
of the deity will manifest itself through that image. This is technically ç
called arc<193>vat<193>ra.
The following are some of the modes of behaviour which will offend ç
the deityin the temple, and bring misery and suffering upon the transgressor: ç
not observing the rules concerning personal, environmental and ceremonial ç
cleanliness, missing the important festivals of the temple, not making ç
obeisance or circumambulation, carelessly treating the things offered ç
to the deity, not offering the best kind of things even though one ç
can afford to do so, disposing off the offered articles to people ç
who have no faith or devotion, engaging in purely secular and non- ç
religious activities in the presence of the deity, boisterous behaviour, ç
observing caste restrictions, misusing the things belonging to the ç
temple and so on.
@SPACE = 
@SB = 10.	The Temple and the Priest
@SPACE = 
It will not be out of place to discuss here the role of the priest ç
in a Hindu temple. Since it is the chief responsibility of the head-priest ç
and his assistants to maintain the spiritual atmosphere of the temple, ç
a strict code of conduct is enjoined upon them. They are expected ç
to lead a very strict and pure life. They should know all the rituals ç
and ceremonies connected with the temple worship and festivities. ç
They should observe all the rules concerning personal and ceremonial ç
purity. They should perform the worship with ·raddh<193> (faith) and ç
devotion. They should not misuse the temple property in any way. On ç
the other hand they should protect it. They should have genuine concern ç
for the devotees and should treat them with sympathy and understanding. ç
Broad- mindedness and a liberal outlook should be an additional qualification ç
for modern priests.
@SB = 11.	The Temple and the Society
Throughout our history, the temple has exercised an enormous influence ç
on our social life. Apart from keeping the torch of dharma burning ç
aloft, the temple has been a great cementing factor. Its shrine and ç
icons have given peace to the frustrated minds. The construction and ç
maintenance of the building have provided employment to the architects, ç
artisans, sculptors and labourers. Religious and musical discourses ç
(pravacanas and harikath<193>s) have helped the propagation of religion. ç
Music, dance and other fine artshave received great encouragement ç
and provided pure and elevating type of entertainment to the devotees. ç
Being a centre of learning, the temple helped in the acquisition and ç
propagation of know-ledge. Both scholars and students found shelter ç
there. With its enormous wealth, it also acted as a bank to the needy, ç
giving easy credits. The granaries of the temple helped to feed the ç
hungry, and those unable to earn their livelihood due to disease and ç
deformity. There are several instances of even hospitals and dispensaries ç
being run by the temple. The temple often played the role of a court ç
of law for settling disputes. The temple also gave shelter to the ç
people during wars. Thus the temple was all-in-all in the social life ç
of our country for centuries.
It may not be out of place if we describe here in a few words, the ç
system of the temple-dancers, commonly known as devad<193>s<200>s. ç
If the god in the temple is considered to be a living being, it is ç
but natural that the devotees should deem it a privilege to offer ç
him all enjoyments to which an emperor or a king is entitled and accustomed! ç
The system of offering unmarried girls to the temple for the service ç
of the deity might have originated this way. And, this is not peculiar ç
to Indiaalone. There is evidence to prove that in ancient Babylonia, ç
Cyprus, Greece, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Syria and Arabia, as also in the ç
South East Asian countries such a system existed.
This system was opposed by the br<193>hma<207>as. However, due to ç
the pressure of the kings and noblemen it came to stay.
The girls chosen to become devad<193>s<200>s would be married to the ç
deity in the temple in a ceremonial way. Their main duties consisted ç
of cleaning the temple, fanning the image, carrying lights, singing ç
and dancing before the deity and the devotees and so on.
The system might have started some time during the 3rd century <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
It soon degenerated into prostitution, thanks to the notorious human ç
weaknesses. The practice of the kings and the noblemen of entertaining ç
their important guests with music and dancing by the slave girls and ç
maids of their harem might have been extended to the devad<193>s<200>s ç
also, so much so, that it drove them to prostitution in course of ç
time.
But for some pockets in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and ç
Tamil Nadu, the system has almost disappeared.
@SB = 12.	Epilogue
It is thus seen that the temple which represents God and His abode, ç
creation and the Creator, man and his true Self, has played no insignificant ç
part in the life of our society. If today its effect has waned considerably, ç
it is worth making a study of the maladies affecting it and try to ç
find appropriate remedies.
@SPACE1 = 
The basic malady from which all other maladies spring is the lack ç
of proper organisation. This again is the outcome of the fact that ç
the Hindu society is the most disorganised society in the whole world! ç
Though organisation and order are found in bits and pieces, here and ç
there, in small and well-knit groups, the Hindu society as a whole ç
suffers from an utter lack of discipline due to the absence of a central ç
church controlling all sections of the Hindu society and claiming ç
the loyalty of all. This problem is as urgent as it is big. It is ç
high time that the highly respected and influential religious leaders ç
of the Hindu society make an earnest attempt to tackle this problem ç
on a war-footing. The earlier, the better. When the Hindus have enough ç
catholicity to accept all the great religious systems of the world ç
as equally valid and true, theycan certainly extend that catholicity ç
towards their own innumerable sects and groups, thereby achieving ç
greater amalgamation and cohesion!
In the scheme of restoration of the temples to their former glory ç
and pride of place, the first problem that confronts us is that of ç
the many historical temples which are in dilapidated condition and ç
wherein regular worship has been totally abandoned. Then there are ç
temples where worship is still in vogue but which need renovation ç
badly. The need to build new temples in the new townships and colonies ç
coming up all-over the country, especially in industrial project areas, ç
cannot also be overemphasised. Hence the constitution of an All India ç
Temple Trust to which not only devotees but also the richer temples ç
in the country will contribute should seriously be considered. This ç
should be an autonomous body and can release the funds to the concerned ç
temple projects as and when necessary.
The second important problem is the one concerning the priests and ç
other staff managing the temple. Efforts should be made to set up ç
enough number of institutions to train up the priests properly on ç
the lines of the <193>gama·<193>stras. Only such trained personnel ç
should be employed in the temples. Though simple living and high thinking ç
should be a basic concept to be integrated with their training, they ç
should be paid decent salaries so that they are not forced to develop ç
the `panda- psychology' which is now rampant and against which almost ç
everybody is railing without understanding their problems and difficulties.
Apart from the spiritual atmosphere, even the physical atmosphere ç
in the precincts of the temple is equally important, since the latter ç
is conducive to the former. It is common knowledge that churches and ç
mosques†even those situated in the socially and culturally backward ç
areas†are kept clean and the votaries of these two religions (Christianity ç
and Islam) maintain good discipline during their community prayers ç
and worship. This is singularly lacking among the Hindus. This constitutes ç
our third problem. Keeping the temples and the surrounding areas clean, ç
maintaining discipline like following the queue system, observing ç
silence at the time of worship and reasonable quietness at other times ç
is a virtue that needs to be inculcated among our people. It is too ç
much to expect the meagre temple staff to perform such tasks. The ç
only way seems to be for the devotees living in the vicinity of the ç
temple to form a volunteer corps of active men and women, including ç
students, who should take turns to keep the temple area clean and ç
educate the people visiting the temple. Hindu religious organisations ç
can conduct short-term courses to train these volunteers. These volunteers ç
will be an asset at the time of festivals and rathotsavas when they ç
can perform other duties like taking care of the footwear, vehicles ç
and personal belongings of the visiting devotees, regulating the queues, ç
helping the aged and the infirm, distributing drinking water, giving ç
emergency medical aid and so on.
@SPACE1 = 
Propagation of our religion among<|>our  people or, to put it succinctly, ç
`Hinduising the Hindus', is another problem, in the solution of which ç
our temples can play an active role. Production of Hindu religious ç
literature, written in non-technical and popular language and at a ç
cheap price is one of the effective methods of such propaganda. The ç
volunteers canhelp in the sale of such literature. Organising regular ç
classes on Hinduism both for children and for adults†the adults need ç
it even more than the children!†is another activity that can be undertaken ç
by the temples. Religious discourses, community bhajans, harikathas ç
and staging of dramas which are in vogue even today, can be organised ç
in more systematic ways.
It may be necessary to point out here one of the banes of our Hindu ç
society: the tendency to convert cash into ornaments and ornamentation, ç
often superfluous, instead of spending the same on socially useful ç
channels like increasing the facilities for the devotees and pilgrims ç
visiting the temple, better emoluments to the temple staff, beautifying ç
the area to create a better atmosphere and so on, apart from what ç
has already been mentioned earlier.
@SPACE1 = 
The ignorance of the Hindus about their own religion is not only colossal ç
but also ignominious. The temples, at least the bigger ones with larger ç
incomes, can organise permanent exhibitions depicting the salient ç
features of our religion and culture. The millions of devotees who ç
visit these temples every year, can be educated at least in the fundamentals ç
of our great religion. (The bigger temples can also think of running ç
educational, cultural and medical institutions to serve the public.)
Marriage  is  the  most  important sacrament in the life of a Hindu. ç
The influence of Western culture is having a deleterious effect upon ç
this. If marriages are compulsorily performed in the temple premises, ç
or at least, solemnised by a suitable ritual in a temple, it may have ç
greater stabilising effect. In addition, the Hindus should feel obliged ç
to attend all the important festivals of a temple in their place should ç
perform at least one important worship of their family in the temple.
The temple has occupied the central place in the Hindu society for ç
centuries and has been the greatest single factor in keeping it together. ç
There is no reason why it should not be revitalised so that it can ç
play even greater roles in the future.
