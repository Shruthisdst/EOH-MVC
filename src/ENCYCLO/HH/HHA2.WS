his first son R<193>m R<193>i. R<193>m R<193>i practically betrayed ç
his own father. Hence the Guru was obliged to bequeath his seat before ç

@NT = hasta
@N1 = (`hand')
Though the word means `hand' in general, it is used in a more technical ç
sense also. It is the same as cubit, the length between the elbow ç
and the end of the middle finger. It is 24 a<209>gulas or 18 inches. ç
This measurement is often used to specify the dimensions of a building, ç
a tank, an embankment and so on.
When a house has to be built, the architect takes the owner's or his ç
wife's or his eldest son's cubit as the basic standard of length.
The word is sometimes used in placeof the word `mudr<193>' (hand-pose) ç
as,for instance, in `abhayahasta' and `varadahasta'.

@N1 = (`the science of [prognostication by studying] the lines in ç
the palm of the hand')
The desire to know the future has been a natural instinct with the ç
human beings. This has led to the discovery or invention of many new ç
fields of knowledge. One  of  them  is  palmistry,  called `Hastas<193>mudrika·<193>stra' ç
by the Hindu scriptures.
It is said that Samudrar<193>ja (the king of the ocean) once studied ç
the various marks on the body of Lord Vi<218><207>u who was in yoganidr<193> ç
(deep meditation) and explained their specialities to his eager disciples. ç
That is why this science came to be known as `S<193>mudrika·<193>stra'.
According to an ancient tradition, Prahl<193>da (the great child-devotee ç
of Lord Vi<218><207>u) was the original teacher of this science.
Some of the ancient treatises on thisscience are: Gargasa<221>hit<193>, ç
Garu<195>a-pur<193><207>a, S<193>mudrikabhoja, Par<193>·ara-s<193>mudrika·<193>stra ç
and Hastasa<210>j<200>van<200>.
The S<193>mudrika·<193>stra has branched off into three wings. They ç
are: Hasta-s<193>mudrika, A<209>gas<193>mudrika and Str<200>-s<193>mudrika.
Whereas A<209>gas<193>mudrika deals with the study of the characteristics ç
of all the limbs (= a<209>gas) of the body, the Hasta-s<193>mudrika ç
concerns itself only with the study of the hasta, the hand or the ç
palm. The last branch deals exclusively with the characteristic signs ç
on the bodies of women.
Anyone who wants to practise Hasta-s<193>mudrika·<193>stra, should ç
be well-conversant with Jyauti<218>a or Astrology also. Any prognostication ç
has to depend on a study of the palms as also the horoscopes.
While studying the hand, the palmist has to see the right hand of ç
men and the left hand of women. The palms of children can be examined ç
only if they are past fourteen years of age.
The following are the factors which have to be studied carefully with ç
regard to the hand and the palm before drawing any conclusions:
Length of fingers as also the position of the lines at the finger-joints; ç
the various mounts or bulged portions, generally at the roots of the ç
fingers; lines on the palms; various signs in the shape of ·a<209>kha ç
(conch), cakra (discus), triangle, fish, bow, lotus, star and so on.
Experts in this field opine that apart from studying at least five ç
thousand hands, the palmist should also lead a goodlife, practise ç
yoga and acquire some basic knowledge of Hindu astrology before prognostication ç
based on the study of the hands and the palms.

Hastin<193>pura or Hastin<193>vat<200> has been known to all those ç
familiar with the epic, the Mah<193>bh<193>rata, as the capital ç
city of the Kuru race of kings†the Kauravas first, and then, of the ç
P<193><207><195>avas.
King Hastin was an ancestor of the Kauravas and the P<193><207><195>avas. ç
He was theson of B<216>hatk<218>attra, a king of the Candrava<221>·a ç
or Lunar race. He built this city during his reign and hence it came ç
to be known as `Hastin<193>pura' or `Hastin<193>-vat<200>'. During ç
the reign of Nicaknu, a descendant of the P<193><207><195>avas, the ç
city is said to have been devastated by floods in the Ga<209>g<193>, ç
forcing him to shift his capital to Kau·<193>mbi (vide Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a ç
4.21).
The site of Hastin<193>pura has been located at a place, 90 kms. (56 ç
miles) to the north-east of Delhi. The excavation done by the Archaeological ç
Survey of India in 1949 revealed that the earliest inhabitants there, ç
used ochre-coloured pottery and copper vessels. The city may have ç
been abandoned due to a rise in the level of the river Ga<209>g<193>.
There are reasons to believe that the city was reoccupied after some ç
time. Relics assigned to this period include sun-dried brick-walls, ç
copper and iron utensils, clay figurines and die-stamped coins.
It might have been abandoned again around 300 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> and reoccupied ç
a second time after a lapse of about a hundred years.

@SPACE = 
Ha<219>hayoga is one of the major branches of the Yoga system that ç
teaches the practical aspects of spiritual life. `Yoga' means the ç
union of the j<200>va (the individual soul) with Param<193>tman (God). ç
The word `ha<219>ha' is split into two syllables, `ha' and `<219>ha', ç
and, interpreted as the `sun' and the `moon' or the `pr<193><207>a' ç
and the `ap<193>na', the two important aspects of the pr<193><207>ic ç
energy working in a living being. According to this explanation, Ha<219>hayoga ç
is the science of pr<193><207><193>y<193>ma that includes other aspects ç
of Yoga also like <193>sanas and mudr<193>s. (See<MS>°SANAS<D> and ç
<MS>MUDR°S.<D>)
According to the tradition described in the scriptures dealing with ç
Ha<219>hayoga, °din<193>tha or God <185>iva is the first teacher who ç
taught it to his divine spouse P<193>rvat<200>.
@SPACE1 = 
Some of the distinguished teachers of this tradition are: Matsyendran<193>tha, ç

Bile·aya, Bhairava, Manth<193>na, K<193>kaca<207><195><200>·vara, ç
Prabhudeva (Allama Prabhu?) and others.
Ha<219>hayoga and R<193>jayoga are two sides of the same coin. Neither ç
is possible without the help of the other. However, the writers on ç
Ha<219>hayoga agree that R<193>jayoga which deals with the control ç
of the mind ultimately leading to sam<193>dhi, is primary and that ç
the former is only an aid to it.
To practise Ha<219>hayoga, a suitable place is needed. It should be ç
clean and secluded, with a level ground. The air must be pure.
Yoga is destroyed by certain habits which, therefore, must be avoided. ç
They are: aty<193>h<193>ra (overeating), pray<193>sa (over-exertion), ç
prajalpa (talkativeness), niyam<193>-graha (observance of unsuitable ç
disciplines like fasting etc.), janasa<209>ga (company of persons ç
not spiritually inclined) and laulya (unsteadiness).
On the other hand, there are certain qualities which are conducive ç
to yoga and hence, need to be cultivated. They are: s<193>hasa (daring), ç
uts<193>ha (enthusiasm), dhairya (courage), tattvaj<210><193>na (true ç
know-ledge), ni·caya (firmness of faith in the words of the guru) ç
and janasa<209>gaparity<193>ga (abandonment of unsuitable company).
Success in this yoga is indicated by certain signs such as the body ç
losing flabbiness and becoming lean, brightness of face and eyes, ç
hearing of the an<193>hata-dhvani (sound of O<209>k<193>ra), better ç
health and appetite, purification of the n<193><195><200>s and so ç
on.
@SPACE1 = 
The steps of Ha<219>hayoga as described in the standard works are ç
generally four. They are: <193>sana (various postures like svastik<193>sana, ç
gomukh<193>sana, v<200>r<193>sana etc.); pr<193><207><193>y<193>ma ç

ten mudr<193>s (exercises needed to rouse the Ku<207><195>alin<200> ç
power).
The fourth, the last (114 verses), delineates sam<193>dhi which comes ç
as a result of the rousing of the Ku<207><195>alin<200>. In sam<193>dhi, ç
the mind will have dissolved in the <193>tman even as salt in water. ç

Vedic sacrifices called yaj<210>as or y<193>gas are an ancient religious ç
institution. They have exercised a tremendous influence on the Hindu ç
society over the millennia.
They are generally classified into three groups: p<193>kayaj<210>as, ç
haviryaj<210>as and somay<193>gas.
Though the word `havis' means any oblatory material, it generally ç
refers to uncooked materials like barley, rice, milk or ghee.
Seven haviryaj<210>as are mentioned in the ·rautas<220>tra literature. ç
They are: Agny<193>dheya, Agnihotra, Dar·ap<220>r<207>am<193>sa, C<193>turm<193>sya, ç

Vedic  sacrifices  needed  several materials that could be offered ç

Five kinds of materials were recommended as havis: au<218>adha (products ç
of trees and plants), payas (milk), pa·u (animals), soma (juice of ç
the soma creeper) and <193>jya (clarified butter).
Rice, barley, their products like caru (porridge) or puro<195><193>·a ç

@N1 = (`one with a horse's head')
Hayagr<200>va, the god with the head of a horse, is one of the minor ç
incarnations of Vi<218><207>u.
Several stories are found in the Vedicand paur<193><207>icliteratureregarding ç
this incarnation.
Y<193>j<210>avalkya, the great sage, lost the Yajurveda as a result ç
of the curse of Vai·amp<193>yana, his teacher. He performed severe ç
penance, praying to S<220>rya, the Sun-god. Pleased by this, S<220>rya ç
appeared before him as a deity with the horse's head and taught him ç
the same Veda in another form. This section has come to be known as ç
the V<193>jasaney<200> Sa<221>hit<193>.
A  demon,  Hayagr<200>va  by  name, obtained several boons from the ç
Dev<200> and became a terror for the world. Since he had prayed that ç
he could be killed only by another like him (i.e., with a horse's ç
head) the gods of heaven worked out a stratagem, by which Vi<218><207>u ç
lost his original head and the A·vinis (twin-gods, physicians of heaven) ç
grafted a horse's head. Vi<218><207>u, in this Hayagr<200>va form, ç
killed the demon (Dev<200>bh<193>gavata 1.5).
According  to  another  story,  two demons Madhu and Kai<219>abha, ç
had stolen the Vedas. Vi<218><207>u took the form of Hayagr<200>va, ç
killed them and recovered the Vedas.
As per the story in the <185><193>ntiparva (chapter 24) of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata, ç
Hayagr<200>va was a noble king. Though he defeated his enemies, since ç
he had not cultivated the friendship of others, he was ultimately ç
killed by the same enemies. The lesson that Vy<193>sa taught to Yudhi<218><219>hira ç
by this story was that even mighty rulers must take the help of others.
Hayagr<200>va is the god of learning, akin to the goddess Sarasvat<200>.
Iconographical works describe him as having a human form, with the ç
head of ahorse, possessing four or eight arms, carrying the various ç
weapons and emblems of Vi<218><207>u.

N<193>rada approaches Brahm<193>, the Creator for the knowledge of ç

The Upani<218>ad is a reply to this question and deals mainly with ç
some mantras of Lord Hayagr<200>va by the repetition of which one ç

At first, three long mantras are given. Brahm<193>, Atri, Ravi, Savit<216> ç

G<193>yatr<200>, Tri<218><219>ubh and Anu<218><219>ubh are the Vedic ç
metres through which they are revealed. Hayagr<200>va is the deity. ç
`Hlaum' is the b<200>ja or seed-letter. The mantras are capable of ç
conferring happiness here and liberation after death.

This  is  followed  by  some  more mantras of 29 letters, 34 letters, ç

His other works are: °yurveda-ras<193>yana (a commentary on the ç
A<218><219><193><209>gah<216>daya of V<193>gbha<219>a), a commentary ç

He belonged to the Vatsagotra. He was the grandson of V<193>sudeva ç
and son of K<193>madeva. He was a high officer in the court of the ç
Y<193>dava kings Mah<193>deva andR<193>macandra of Devagiri (modern ç
Daulatabad in Maharashtra). He must have existed in the 13th century ç

This earth comprises seven dv<200>pas or islands. Each island has ç
seven distinguishing mountains called `Kulaparvatas'.
Hemak<220><219>a is one of the seven Kulaparvatas of Jamb<220>dv<200>pa, ç
the island where Bh<193>ratavar<218>a or India is situated. It is ç
situated to the north of the Him<193>layas. On its two sides is situated ç
the Lava<207>a-samudra or the ocean of salt. Kubera's capital city† ç
Alak<193>pur<200>†rests on one of its peaks.

@NT = hema·r<193>ddha
@N1 = (`·r<193>ddha with gold [or money]')
Honouring the dead ancestors and gratefully remembering them on the ç
day of their death has been an important religious duty of the Hindus. ç
The ceremony conducted on such occasions is called `·r<193>ddha'. ç
(See <MS><185>R°DDHA<D> for details.)
When a regular ·r<193>ddha cannot be performed due to some problems ç
like a·auca or journey, it can be substituted with <193>ma·r<193>ddha ç
(See <MS>°MA<185>R°DDHA<D> for details.) or hema·r<193>ddha.
If in <193>ma·r<193>ddha, twice the quantity of grains (needed for ç
cooked food in a regular ·r<193>ddha) is given as gift, in hema·r<193>ddha, ç
money needed for four times the quantity of grains has to be donated ç
to worthy persons.

@NT = Heramba-Ga<207>apati
@SPACE = 
Ga<207>apati or Ga<207>e·a, the elephant-faced god, is an extremely ç
popular deity of the Hindu pantheon. Out of the several aspects of ç
this god, the Heramba-Ga<207>apati is also one, which seems to be ç
more popular in Nepal. `Heramba' means one puffed up with the pride ç
of strength and valour.
@SPACE = 
This Ga<207>apati has five faces and ten arms in which he holds broken ç
tusk, club, rosary, goad, a fruit, axe, sweet (modaka) and a noose. ç
The other two hands exhibit the abhaya and the varada mudr<193>s (offering ç
protection and boons).

@NT = hetv<193>bh<193>sa
@N1 = (`seeminglyreasonableor logical')
Ny<193>ya or logic is an important aspect of all philosophical systems. ç
It is needed either to prove one's standpoint or tocontradict anddisprovethat ç
ofthe opponent.
One of the means of knowledge† called `pram<193><207>as' or valid ç
sources of know- ledge†is anum<193>na or inference.
The most frequently quoted and widely accepted mode of expressing ç
the anum<193>na pram<193><207>a is as follows:
There is fire on the yonder hill, because smoke is rising from there. ç
It is well-known from our experience (of direct perception) that wherever ç
there is smoke, there is fire. Hence, by seeing the smoke, eventhough ç
we may not be actually seeing the fire, we can infer the existence ç
of fire there.
In this example, the rising of smoke which is invariably associated ç
with fire, is technically called `hetu,' `li<209>ga' or `s<193>dhana'. ç
When this hetu is only an <193>bh<193>sa (illusory), it is called ç
`hetv<193>bh<193>sa'. For instance, take this statement:
`All bipeds are rational.
Swans are bipeds.
Hence, swans are rational.'
The conclusion of this inference is false because the hetu given (that ç
all bipeds are rational) is itself <193>bh<193>sa, illusory or unreal.
Hetv<193>bh<193>sa is of five kinds: savyabhi-c<193>ra, viruddha, ç
satpratipak<218>a, asiddha and b<193>dhita.
See under each title for details.
@NT = Him<193>layas
@N1 = (`the abode of snow')
Like the Ga<209>g<193> among the rivers, the Him<193>layas among the ç
mountains have become an integral part of the Hindu religion, culture ç
and ethos. Even the <184>gveda (10.121.4) mentions it as reflecting ç
the greatness of God. Over the centuries, the mountain range has been ç
all things to all beings. Its presiding deity is Himav<193>n. His ç
wife is Men<193>, a daughter of the pit<216>devat<193>s or manes. ç
Main<193>ka (mountain) is his son. Apar<207><193> (or P<193>rvat<200>), ç
Ekapar<207><193> and Ekap<193><219>al<193> are his daughters. These ç
three were married to <185>iva, the sages Asita and Jaig<200><218>avya.
Mount Meru is said to be situated in the Him<193>layas.
@SPACE1 = 
The Him<193>layas are the source of manyrivers such as Bh<193>g<200>rath<200> ç
(Ga<209>g<193>), Yamun<193>, Sarasvat<200>, Vi·ok<193> and Vitast<193>. ç
They are considered as `devat<200>rtha' (divine rivers) and hence ç
sacred. Many places of pilgrimage are situated in the Him<193>layan ç
ranges. Some of them are: Amaran<193>tha, Ked<193>ran<193>tha, Badar<200>n<193>tha, ç
Devapray<193>ga, Ga<209>gotr<200>, Yamunotr<200> and so on. Badari- ç
k<193>·rama where the twin-sages Nara-N<193>r<193>ya<207>a performed ç
severe austerities, is situated here. Vedavy<193>sa is said to have ç
composed all his works here only. The P<193><207><195>avas passed ç
through the Him<193>layas in their mah<193>-prasth<193>na or final ç
journey to heaven.
It is the repository of many a rare medicinal plant. The R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
mentions the famous sa<210>j<200>van<200> herb which was secured by ç
Hanum<193>n from here.
The Him<193>laya mountains consist of parallel ranges, 2500 kms. (1500 ç
miles) long and 250 kms. (150 miles) in width. There are 114 peaks ç
which are over 600 metres (20,000 ft.) in height. Seventy-five of ç
them are higher than 7200 metres (24,000 ft.). All these are perpetually ç
snow-clad andshrouded in mist. Fierce winds and avalanches are quite ç
common.
@NT = hi<221>s<193> 
@N1 = (`violence')
Hinduism has always considered moral purity as a prerequisite of spiritual ç
quest and perfection. Among the moral disciplines strongly recommended, ç
ahi<221>s<193> or non-violence gets the primary place.
Since ahi<221>s<193> has been defined as not injuring any living being ç
either physically or by harsh words or even by inimical thoughts, ç
the opposite of this can be considered as hi<221>s<193> or violence. ç
So hi<221>s<193> is any act that hurts a person's body or mind, whether ç
it ultimately causes his death or not.
The Hindu scriptures (vide Yoga-s<220>tras of Pata<210>jali 2.34) ç
go to the extent of telling us that hi<221>s<193>, whether perpetrated ç
directly or caused to be perpetrated by others or even approved of, ç
when committed by others, is a sin and must be eschewed. Such persons ç
go to hell and suffer terribly for a long time.
@SPACE1 = 
However, immolation of animals in Vedic sacrifices or hi<221>s<193> ç
committed by one under attack, for saving one's life and limb, are ç
not considered as hi<221>s<193>.
