According to a second story, R<193>ma decided to build a temple for ç
<185>iva to atone for the killing of R<193>va<207>a (who was a br<193>hma<207>a). ç
When he was returning from La<209>k<193> in the Pu<218>pakavim<193>na ç
(the divine aeroplane), he alighted at the place (now known as R<193>me·vara) ç
and expressed this desire to his divine spouse S<200>t<193>. She then ç
prepared a li<209>ga out of sea-sand which was duly consecrated by ç
R<193>ma.
As per another version, Hanum<193>n had been sent to V<193>r<193><207>as<200> ç
(K<193>·<200>) to bring a li<209>ga. Since he was late in returning ç
and since the auspicious moment was coming to an end, S<200>t<193> ç
prepared the li<209>ga and R<193>ma consecrated it. The li<209>ga ç
brought later by Hanum<193>n was also established in another place ç
nearby (now known as Vi·vali<209>ga). To pacify him R<193>ma made ç
it a rule that pilgrims should worship that li<209>ga first and ç
then only visit the main shrine.

@NT = R<193>mali<209>gar
@N1 = (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1823-1874)
R<193>mali<209>gar†also known as R<193>ma-li<209>gasv<193>m<200>†was ç
a great Tamil (devotional) poet of the recent times whose poems are ç
quite popular.
Born in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1823 as the second son of R<193>mayyapi<202><202>ai ç
and Cinnamm<193>i, in the village Marud<220>r near Cidambaram in Tamil ç
Nadu, R<193>mali<209>ga lost his father early and was brought up by ç
his elder brother Sabh<193>pati. Being endowed with a prodigious memory ç
and intellect, he was well-educated by his brother.
Intensely devoted to God right from his early age, he is said to have ç
been blessed with a high mystical or spiritual experience at the Ty<193>gar<193>ja ç
(<185>iva) temple in Tiruvo<219><219>iy<220>r. Since then he cultivated ç
on attitude of filial devotion towards God.
Subrahma<207>ya was his favourite deity of prayer and worship.
Though married, he lived like a monk, unattached to the affairs of ç
the world.
He toured widely in Tamil Nadu, visited many places of pilgrimage ç
and established an institution at Va<195>al<220>r which provides free ç
food and lodging to itinerant monks and poor people. He also established ç
a p<193><219>ha·<193>l<193> (traditional school) for the benefit of ç
indigent students.
He is famous for his compositions in the Tirumurai form of Tamil poetry. ç
He composed more than a thousand verses in the ancient v<216>tta metre. ç
They are highly devotional and are addressed to both <185>iva and ç
Vi<218><207>u.
Some of his poems are also in the style of folk poetry.
All his poems are compiled into one work called Aru<202>p<193>.
His two works in prose are: Manumurai Ka<207><195>avacakam and J<200>vak<193>ru<207>ya ç
O<202>ukkam.
The sentiment of devotion is palpable in all his works.
He advised people to lead a pure life according to dharma, avoid wasting ç
one's life in sensual pleasures, not harm any living being and look ç
upon all with an equal eye.
Total surrender to God was his main teaching.
@NT = Rama<207>a Mahar<218>i
@N1 = (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1879-1950)
Rama<207>a Mahar<218>i was, undoubtedly, one of the greatest spiritual ç
giants of Modern India.
He was born at Tiruccu<202>i in Tamil Nadu on the 30th December 1879 ç
as thesecond son of Sundaram Iyer and A<202>agamm<193><202>. His ç
original name was Ve<207>ka<219>ar<193>ma.
One day in 1895, he accidentally heard the name of a place of pilgrimage ç
dedicated to <185>iva†Aru<207><193>cala†which produced an ecstatic ç
experience. Next year, he had another strange experience, as if he ç
had died and was yet living, fully conscious, looking at his own `dead ç
body'. This produced a deep conviction in him that he was the spirit ç
transcending the body and the mind, generally called `<193>tman' in ç
Ved<193>nta.
Soon after this experience, he left his home for good and went to ç
Aru<207><193>cala, in quest of that spiritual experience, to make ç
it a permanent asset of his life.
There was a cave-like structure below the large temple hall, known ç
as p<193>t<193>la-li<209>ga. The young mendicant started living there, ç
mostly in deep meditation. During this period and later, some good ç
Samaritans took care of him. He also had to change his dwelling place ç
a number of times. His mother A<202>agamm<193><202> who tried to take ç
him back home, ultimately started staying with him permanently.
Some of the places where he stayed before settling down at the present ç
place(in <MS>A.<|>D<D>. 1922)†now known as Rama<207><193>·rama†are: ç
the Vir<220>p<193>k<218>a Cave (17 years) and the Skand<193>·rama ç
(6 years), both in the vicinity of the present <193>·rama.
@SPACE1 = 
As his name†as an <193>tmaj<210><193>ni (self-realised soul) or a ç
j<200>vanmukta, fullyliberated person†spread far and wide, devotees, ç
spiritual aspirants and others started pouring in, in large numbers. ç
Tiruva<207><207><193>mali (the town) and the Rama<207><193>·rama, ç
his abode, became a veritable place of pilgrimage.
Some of the prominent persons who were deeply influenced by him were: ç
K<193>vyaka<207><219>ha Ga<207>apati Muni (a great scholar); Paul ç
Brunton; Major A.<|>W.<|>Chadwick; S. S. Cohen and Arthur Osborne.
Brunton and Osborne have written biographies of the sage.
First  signs  of  cancer  (sarcoma) appeared on his left elbow in ç
<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1948. In spite of repeated operations, radium therapy ç
and various other kinds of treatment, it did not subside. He passed ç
away on the 14th April 1950.
The true nature of an <193>tmaj<210><193>ni (a man who has realised ç
his Self) was revealed in his life and personality, constantly and ç
continuously. Silent radiation of intense peace was the chief characte-ristic ç
of his personality.
His main teaching or advice to the aspirants was to find out ``Who ç
am I' (N<193>n y<193>r?). By a constant enquiry and self-analysis ç
one arrives at the truth that he is the pure <193>tman (of the nature ç
of sat-cit-<193>nanda, existence-consciousness-bliss) transcending ç
the body-mind complex.
His most famous work is U<202><202>adu N<193>rpadu in Tamil. Its ç
Sanskrit version is Sad-dar·ana by Ga<207>apati Muni.
Another work, a spontaneous outpouring of marital love (or bridal ç
mysticism) towards Aru<207><193>cala <185>iva is <185>r<200> Aru<207><193>cala ç
Ak<218>arama<207>a M<193>lai containing 108 verses in Tamil and composed ç
during one of the circumambulations of the Aru<207><193>cala hill.
@SPACE1 = 
There are also a few other compositions in verses containing high ç
Advaitic sentiments.
There is no doubt that he was the brightest spiritual star of the ç
most recent period, in the firmament of Hindu religion and philosophy.
@NT = R<193>m<193>nanda
@N1 = (14th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>)
One of the more well-known saints of the Middle Ages, R<193>m<193>nanda ç
might have lived sometime during the period <MS>A.D.<D> 1300-1411 ç
or <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1400-1470.
He was born at Pray<193>ga (Allahabad), his parents being Puy<193>sadana ç
and Su·<200>l<193>. Well-educated in Sanskrit and the Hindu scriptures, ç
he received monastic orders from R<193>ghav<193>nanda, a sa<221>ny<193>sin ç
(monk) of the <185>r<200>vai<218><207>ava tradition of R<193>m<193>nuja ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1017-1137). Though devoted to the R<193>m<193>nuja ç
tradition and its Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita philosophy, he was much ç
more liberal in his attitude and dealings. He lived mostly in K<193>·<200>.
It was he who spread the cult of R<193>mabhakti or devotion to R<193>ma, ç
in preference to that of K<216><218><207>a, mostly in North India.
According to some versions of his life, he migrated from South India ç
where he lived earlier, to the North.
R<193>m<193>nuja's <185>r<200>bh<193><218>ya (commentary on the ç
Brahmas<220>tras) and a less known work, the Agastyasut<200>k<218><207>a-sa<221>v<193>da, ç
were his favourite treatises.
He considered R<193>ma as same as the Brahman of the Upani<218>ads ç
and the repeti-tion of the R<193>mamantra as the best means of liberation. ç
Instead of the well-known A<218><219><193>k<218>ar<200> mantra (O<221> ç
namo n<193>r<193>ya<207><193>ya) he adopted the R<193>mamantra (given ç
perhaps by his guru), r<193><221> r<193>m<193>ya nama<199>as the ç
chief esoteric formula of spiritual life.
Tradition states that he accepted his disciples irrespective of their ç
caste and social status. Among them Kab<200>r (a Muslim), Raid<193>s ç
(a shoemaker), Sen<193> (a barber) and Padm<193>vat<200> (a woman) ç
were well-known, though doubts are expressed by some scholars about ç
the inclusion of some of these names.
The Granth S<193>hib contains one Hindi song of his, though that ç
song has not been found in the collection of his disciples.
@NT = R<193>manavam<200>
Eight days after Yug<193>di or on the ninth day of the bright half ç
of the month of Caitra, falls the birthday of <185>r<200> R<193>ma, ç
one of the two most popular and highly revered incarnations of Lord ç
Vi<218><207>u. He is said to have been born at noon.
The R<193>manavam<200>vrata is nitya or compulsory for the devotees ç
of R<193>ma and optional for others. One of the highly eulogized vratas ç
in the Hindu calendar, it can destroy one's sins and also confer even ç
mukti or liberation.
Actually the vrata commences from the previous night itself with fasting. ç
On the navam<200> day also the votary has to continue fasting, perform ç
worship and homa to R<193>ma in an image installed in a specially ç
prepared shrine, do japa of R<193>mamantra and keep vigil in the night. ç
After the completion of the vrata he has to donate the image to the ç
<193>c<193>rya (a learned br<193>hma<207>a well-versed in the rite) ç
along with other gifts made liberally.
In the modern days gifting the image of R<193>ma is extremely rare. ç
Fasting is done by the more orthodox persons only. However, people ç
do assemble in very large numbers in R<193>ma temples and enthusiastically ç
participate in the festivities there. P<193>r<193>ya<207>a or ceremonial ç
recitation of the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a (usually spread over the ç
nine days from Yug<193>di), arranging religio- cultural  programmes  like  Harikath<193> ç
(musical discourse on mythological stories) and classical music or ç
devotional songs are quite common.
Celebrations at places associated with R<193>ma, like Ayodhy<193> ç
in Uttar Pradesh andR<193>me·varam in Tamil Nadu attract thousands ç
of devotees.

@SPACE = 
India seems to have a special knack of producing great saints almost ç
on a `made to order' basis, as per the needs of the times.
When   <185>a<209>kara's   (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 788-820) Advaita Ved<193>nta ç
was being misinterpretated and misused, there was a great need to ç
restore the balance between true j<210><193>na (spiritual wisdom) ç
and genuine bhakti (devotion to God sans sentimentalism). It was during ç
this critical period that R<193>m<193>nuja's advent took place.
R<193>m<193>nuja (considered by his followers as a reincarnation of ç
Lak<218>ma<207>a, the younger brother of R<193>ma) was born as the ç
son of °s<220>ri Ke·ava D<200>k<218>ita and K<193>nti- mat<200> at ç
<185>r<200>perumbud<220>r, 48 kms. (30miles) to the south-west of ç
Madras or Chennai, the present capital of Tamil Nadu.
Endowed with a sharp intellect anda prodigious memory, he was well-educated ç
even at a young age.
Ke·ava D<200>k<218>ita got him married at the age of sixteen, as was ç
the custom during those days. Soon after this, Ke·ava D<200>k<218>ita ç
passed away, plunging the whole family in grief.
Partly to forget the grief of bereavement, but mainly for the higher ç
education of R<193>m<193>nuja, the family now shifted to the well-known ç
town of K<193><210>c<200>puram. R<193>m<193>nuja now started his higher ç
studies under Y<193>davaprak<193>·a, a Ved<193>ntic scholar of repute ç
during those days.
Y<193>davaprak<193>·a's leanings towards dry monism, bereft of devotion ç
to a Personal God, soon brought him into intellectual conflicts with ç
R<193>m<193>nuja whose genius and deeply devotional temperament could ç
not be countered by him. After a few unfortunate incidents and encounters, ç
R<193>m<193>nuja had to leave him for good.
Meanwhile R<193>m<193>nuja's name had become so well-known that Y<193>mun<193>c<193>rya, ç
the chief pontiff of the <185>r<200>vai<218><207>ava (a sect of Vai<218><207>avas ç
or worshippers of Vi<218><207>u) monastery at <185>r<200>ra<209>gam ç
(a famous temple- town on the bank of the river K<193>ver<200> in ç
Tamil Nadu) had decided to take him as his successor. However, he ç
died before he could carry out his wish. It so happened that R<193>m<193>nuja ç
reached the burial ground before the body was consigned to the earth, ç
but found three fingers of his right hand clenched. Learning of the ç
dead-saint's last desires†three in number and unfulfilled during his ç
lifetime†he openly promised before the gathering of mourners to fulfil ç
all of them. And lo! the three fingers opened out!
The following were those promises:
@SPACE1 = 
1.<+>Remaining in the Vai<218><207>ava fold, Ishall arrange for a ç
commentary to be written on the Tiruv<193>ymo<202>i of Namm<193><202>v<193>r.
2.<+>I shall write a commentary on the Brahmas<220>tras of B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a.
3.<+>In honour of the great sage Par<193>·ara, who wrote the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a, ç
Ishall leave behind a great Vai<218><207>ava by that name.
R<193>m<193>nuja had been in close touch with K<193><210>c<200>p<220>r<207>a, ç
a great devotee of God, whose company he often sought and felt inspired. ç
However, since he belonged to the ·<220>dra caste, R<193>m<193>nuja's ç
wife Rak<218><193>mb<193><202> treated him with disdain. This, as ç
also other incidents that revealed his wife's innate incapacity to ç
rise to the higher levels of his own psychological make-up, made R<193>m<193>nuja ç
renounce theworld and take sa<221>ny<193>sa (monastic orders) at ç
K<193><210>c<200>puram in front of the temple of Varadar<193>ja (Vi<218><207>u), ç
assuming the new name `Yatir<193>ja'.
He then retired to <185>r<200>ra<209>gam, settled down there and studied ç
many Vai<218><207>ava texts under the guidance of an outstanding scholar ç
of those times, Mah<193>p<220>r<207>a. He also received the sacred ç
a<218><219><193>k<218>ar<200>mantra (eight-syllabled mantra of N<193>r<193>ya<207>a) ç
from the great saint Go<218><219>h<200>p<220>r<207>a who also forbade ç
him from revealing it to anyone else. Strangely enough, the very first ç
act of R<193>m<193>nuja was to announce it loudly to one and all from ç
the tower of a way-side temple, much to the chagrin of his guru Go<218><219>h<200>p<220>r<207>a. ç
When R<193>m<193>nuja confessed his `guilt' but explained that he ç
was prepared to go to hell because of this sacrilegious act, if the ç
listeners of the mantra would instantly be liberated, the guru was ç
dumb-founded and fell at his feet!
@SPACE1 = 
At the command of God (Ra<209>gan<193>tha) R<193>m<193>nuja took over ç
the management of the temple of <185>r<200>ra<209>gam and reorganised ç
it very efficiently. This raised the animo-sity of some priests who ç
had their ownaxes to grind. However, all their machinations to harm ç
him were set at naught by divine grace.
During his long stay at <185>r<200>ra<209>gam, R<193>m<193>nuja was ç
able to win many disciples, quite a few of whom were weaned awayfrom ç
other schools and sects to Vai<218><207>avism.
He also trained in his ma<219>ha (mona-stery), seventy-four pious ç
householders to become family gurus to the general run of devotees ç
and followers.
As promised before the dead-body of Y<193>mun<193>c<193>rya, R<193>m<193>nuja ç
wrote the <185>r<200>bh<193><218>ya, a detailed commentary on the ç
Brahmas<220>tras (or Ved<193>ntas<220>tras) of B<193>dar<193>ya<207>a ç
(Vy<193>sa) according to theistic (Vai<218><207>avite) philosophy, ç
now well-known as Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita. For this he had to travel ç
all the way to K<193>·m<200>ra where the only manuscript of a famous ç
ancient commentary by the sage Bodh<193>yana was available and which ç
formed the basis for his work. He was lucky to get its help.
He thus fulfilled the most important of the three promises he had ç
given to the soul of Y<193>mun<193>c<193>rya.
He had already fulfilled the first promise by his discourses on the ç
Tiruv<193>y-mo<202>i of Namm<193><202>v<193>r and by giving the ç
Divyaprabandhams (See <MS>DIVYAPRABAN-DHAM<D> for details.) a status ç
equal to that of the Sanskrit scriptures.
@SPACE1 = 
As regards the third, it was fulfilled by giving the name Par<193>·arabha<219><219>a, ç
to the son of his prominent disciple K<220>re·a and urging him to ç
write a bh<193><218>ya or commentary on the well-known hymn of Vi<218><207>u, ç
the Vi<218><207>usahasran<193>ma, thereby perpetuating the memory ç
of the great sage Par<193>·ara (father of Vedavy<193>sa and composer ç
of the Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a).
During his stay at <185>r<200>ra<209>gam in Tamil Nadu, R<193>m<193>nuja ç
had to face the wrath of the fanatical <185>aiva king Kulottu<209>ga. ç
To escape from him, R<193>m<193>nuja migrated to Melko<219>e near ç
the city of Mysore where he, later on, built a nice temple of Vi<218><207>u ç
(known as Celuva-n<193>r<193>ya<207>a or <185>elvapi<202><202>ai). ç
Since the people of the depressed castes had helped him to recover ç
the original (ancient) image buried under a mound, which he later ç
established in the temple, he gave them the privilege of entering ç
the temple for a vision of the Lord, for three days every year. This ç
was a revolutionary step for those days of rabid casteism.
Before he returned to <185>r<200>ra<209>gam after the demise of Kulottu<209>ga, ç
an image of his was installed in the Melko<219>e temple premises, ç
with his consent. A similar image was also installed at <185>r<200>perumbu-d<220>r, ç
his birthplace.
He spent his last days at <185>r<200>ra<209>gam itself and passed ç
away peacefully during the month of M<193>gha (January-February) in ç
<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1137.
The greatest contribution of R<193>m<193>nuja was to preach and establish ç
a religio-philosophical system that gave equal importance to j<210><193>na ç
(knowledge) and bhakti (devotion).
R<193>m<193>nuja wrote (in Sanskrit) eight works in all, of which ç
the <185>r<200>bh<193><218>ya was the magnum opus.
@SPACE1 = 
The other seven are: Ved<193>rtha Sa<209>graha (a compendium of ç
important statements from the major Upani<218>ads with his own interpretation, ç
according to the Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita school); Ved<193>ntad<200>pa ç
and Ved<193>ntas<193>ra (abridged commentaries on the Ved<193>ntas<220>tras ç
or the Brahmas<220>tras); G<200>t<193>bh<193><218>ya; Nityagrantha ç
dealing with the daily rituals and devotional practices for his followers; ç
the three hymnal works in prose, known as the Gadyatraya.
The three components of the Gadyatraya are: <185>ara<207><193>gatigadya ç
(dealing with the greatness of self-surrender); <185>r<200>ra<209>gagadya ç
(prayer to God to accept him as his eternal servant); Vaiku<207><219>hagadya ç
(a description of Vaiku<207><219>ha, the world of Vi<218><207>u).
R<193>m<193>nuja's great contribution lies in his bringing together ç
the Vedic ideology and methodology rooted in the Sanskrit scriptural ç
texts and the purely devotional heritage of the °<202>v<193>rs (See<MS> ç
°<170>V°RS.<D>), thuscreating what is now called the `Ubhaya-Ved<193>nta,' ç
`Ved<193>nta based on two traditions'.
The Ved<193>nta system of R<193>m<193>nuja is known as the Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita ç
Dar·ana. It is advaita or monism but vi·i<218><219>a or qualified. ç
According to him Brahman (God, the Absolute) is the highest and independent ç
reality. Acit (insentient nature, also knownas prak<216>ti) and cit ç
(the conscious beings, the j<200>vas or individual souls) are also ç
eternal realities but dependent on Brahman who includes them and also ç
transcends them.
Brahman is the Supreme Person (Sarve·vara) endowed with infinite auspicious ç
qualities. He is responsible for s<216><218><219>i (creation), sthiti ç
(maintenance) and pralaya (dissolution) of this world.
The j<200>vas are atomic in size and infinite in number. They are ç
different from the body and possess consciousness as an attribute.
@SPACE1 = 
The aspirants desirous of attaining mukti or liberation must start ç
with theperformance of prescribed karmas or duties. This leads to ç
the purification of their minds making them fit to tread the spiritual ç
path of j<210><193>na (knowledge) and bhakti (devotion), including ç
prapatti (self-surrender).
Acit is the insentient matter, the matrix of the world, out of which ç
the physical universe is created.
The liberated j<200>vas live in Paramapada or Vaiku<207><219>ha, the ç
special abode of the Lord N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, with divine bodies, ç
eternally enjoying his company. They will never again return to this ç
mundane existence.

@NT = R<193>ma-p<220>rvat<193>pan<200>ya Upani<218>ad
This is one of the minor Upani<218>ads assigned  to  the  Atharva<207>aveda  and ç
devoted to the cult of R<193>ma. There are 94 verses in the anu<218><219>ubh ç
metre spread over five chapters, each being known as `Upani<218>ad.'
The first chapter with 13 verses gives several interesting definitions ç
of the word `R<193>ma.' Two of them are:
1.<+><|>One by whom the r<193>k<218>asas (r<193>) are killed (m<193>ra<207>a; ç
ma).
2.<+><|>One in whom the yogins find pleasure (ramante).
The second chapter with only three verses describes how the whole ç
universe has come out of the seed `R<193>ma,' even as the banyan tree ç
comes out of its tiny seed.
@SPACE1 = 
The third chapter describes the whole universe as a yantra (geometrical ç
representation) of R<193>ma and his spouse S<200>t<193>. Obeisance ç
to them with the word nama<199> is itself the mantra (esoteric formula).
The fourth chapter with 67 verses is the longest. The subjects dealt ç
with in this are:
The six-syllabled mantra of R<193>ma (as indicated in the R<193>marahasyopani<218>ad ç
2.16-24); a prayer to R<193>ma by gods for the destruction of their ç
enemies; prayer by the <216><218>is or sages which gives the story ç
of R<193>m<193> in brief; a beautiful description of R<193>ma, after ç
being crowned as the king;details of inscribing the R<193>mayantra ç
(mystical diagram infused with the spiritof R<193>ma); m<193>l<193>mantra ç
consisting of48letters, beginning with Om namo bhagavate raghunandan<193>ya ç
and ending with vi<218><207>ave nama<199>; and, the eulogy of the ç
yantra.
The last section with ten verses deals with some ritualistic aspects ç
connected with bh<220>ta·uddhi (purification of elements), worship ç
of the p<200><219>ha or the base, meditation on the Lord or God and ç
attainment of mukti or liberation by his grace.
@NT = R<193>marahasya Upani<218>ad
A minor Upani<218>ad belonging to the Atharvaveda, the R<193>marahasya ç
Upani<218>ad has 157 verses spread over five chapters. The third ç
chapter is completely in prose. Other chapters too contain prose passages ç
here and there. It is in the form of a longdialogue between the sages ç
led by Sanaka and devotees like Prahl<193>da, with Hanum<193>n, the ç
matchless devotee of R<193>ma.
The speciality of this Upani<218>ad is that it deals with several ç
esoteric mantras of R<193>ma, their uses, yantras (mystical diagrams) ç
and rituals.
A brief account of the same may now be attempted here.
@S10N = First chapter (15 verses)
Sanaka and other sages along with the devotees of Lord Vi<218><207>u, ç
like Prahl<193>da and Vibh<200><218>a<207>a, approach Hanum<193>n ç
and ask him what the tattva or the ultimate Truth is.
Hanum<193>n replies that R<193>ma is the highest Truth, the Brahman ç
that helps one to be saved from transmigratory existence.
He  further  states  that  himself, Ga<207>apati, Sarasvat<200>, Durg<193>, ç
K<218>etrap<193>la, S<220>rya, Candra, N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, N<193>rasi<221>ha, ç
V<193>yu, V<193>r<193>ha as also S<200>t<193>, Lak<218>ma<207>a, <185>atrughna, ç
Bharata, Vibh<200><218>a<207>a, Sugr<200>va, A<209>gada and J<193>mbav<193>n ç
are the a<209>gas or limbs as it were, of R<193>ma. Their mantras ç
(esoteric formulae) should be repeated first to get the grace of R<193>ma.
He next deals with the efficacy of R<193>mamantra of six letters as ç
also the simple R<193>mamantra of two letters with Pra<207>ava (Om) ç
on both sides.
This is followed by Vibh<200><218>a<207>a's question to R<193>ma himself ç
about the method of destruction of heinous sins. R<193>ma replies ç
that by repeating `R<193>ma' 96 crores of times, it is achieved!
If one is unable to do this, the same result can be attained by repeating ç
daily any one of the following: This Upani<218>ad, G<200>t<193>, ç
R<193>masahasran<193>ma, R<193>m<193><218><219>ottara-·atan<193>ma, ç
the hymns composed by N<193>rada or Hanum<193>n, the S<200>t<193>stava ç
and the six lettered mantra of R<193>ma.
