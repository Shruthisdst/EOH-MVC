@NT = r<193>ga
@N1 = (`that which colours,' `attachment')
@NID = <+><+><+><|>One of the most commonly used words, `r<193>ga' comes ç
from the root-verb `ra<210>j' (= to colour). Anything that `colours' ç
the mind, makes it strongly attached, is r<193>ga.
The Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (2.64; 3.34; 14.7) uses this word in the ç
general sense of attachment to anything and that it is caused by the ç
quality called rajas, the second of the three gu<207>as.
The Yogas<220>tras (3.7) of Pata<210>jali (200<MS>B.<|>C.<D>) describes ç
it as the extreme desire that arises in the mind after a pleasurable ç
experience, the residual desire to get that pleasure once again and ç
the consequent attachment towards the means of getting it. Along with ç
dve<218>a or hatred, it is considered as a great obstacle in the path ç
of spiritual unfoldment.
In the science of music, r<193>ga is a tune generated by the proper ç
combination of the saptasvaras or the seven fundamental notes. Here, ç
they are called r<193>gas because they give pleasure to the mind.
These r<193>gas are classed as six by the authorities on music, though ç
the names differ in the lists given by them. For instance, one list ç
gives them as: M<193>lava, Indra, Mall<193>ra, <185>r<200>r<193>ga, ç
Vasanta and Hindola.
Each of these r<193>gas has six feminine associates†called  r<193>gi<207><200>s†taking  their ç
total to thirty six.
Sometimes, depending upon the sentiments produced, the r<193>gas are ç
also classified as pu<221>r<193>ga (male), str<200>r<193>ga (female) ç
and napu<221>sakar<193>ga (neuter).
The pu<221>r<193>gas produce the sentiments of heroism and wonder; ç
the str<200>r<193>gas, of amour and humour; the napu<221>sakar<193>gas, ç
of peace and fear.

@N1 = (`attachment and aversion')
The two words r<193>ga (attachment) and dve<218>a (hatred or aversion) ç
are often used together since the two are, in a way, interconnected. ç
When somebody thwarts a person from fulfilling his desire, born out ç
of r<193>ga, it turns into dve<218>a or aversion towards that person ç
causing the obstacle.
They are the equivalents of k<193>ma (desire) and krodha (anger), ç
the first two of the ari<218>a<195>vargas (the six enemies of spiritual ç
evolution).
@NT = r<193>g<193>nugabhakti
@N1 = (`devotion that follows emotion')
Bhakti or devotion to God has been categorised into several varieties ç
by the various schools of Bhakti Ved<193>nta. Two such are the vaidh<200>bhakti ç
and the r<193>g<193>nugabhakti.
If the former follows the vidhis or the rules set in the ·<193>stras ç
(holy books or scripture), the latter follows just one's r<193>ga ç
or emotional attachment. Hence it can take any form of human emotion ç
towards God, who too may be considered as one's child or friend or ç
beloved. God also will respond in the same way as towards Ya·od<193> ç
(as her child), Arjuna (as a friend) or the gop<200>s (as their beloved).

One of the brightest stars of Dvaita Ved<193>nta philosophy after ç
Madhv<193>c<193>rya (<MS>A.D.<D> 1238-1317) was R<193>ghavendra T<200>rtha ç
popularly known as `R<193>yaru' in Karnataka.
Born to V<200><207><193> Timma<207><207>abha<219><219>a and Gopamma ç
as their last child†by the special grace of Lord Ve<209>ka<219>e·vara ç
of Tirupati†he was named Ve<209>ka<219>abha<219><219>a. Being  extraordinarily  intelligent,  he ç
mastered the scriptures at an early age. He also became proficient ç
in playing on the V<200><207><193> (lute).
He was married to Sarasvat<200>dev<200> and had a son, Lak<218>m<200>n<193>r<193>ya<207>a, ç
from her.
Later on, Suddhindrat<200>rtha (16th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>), the pontiff ç
of a M<193>dhva ma<219>ha (monastery of the dvaita tradition), under ç
whom Ve<209>ka<219>abha<219><219>a had got higher education, gave ç
him sa<221>ny<193>sa (monastic order) and appointed him as his successor. ç
His monastic name was R<193>ghavendra-t<200>rtha.
During his long tenure as the next pontiff (from <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1623<|>to<|>1671) ç
he contributed a lot to the spread of Dvaita Ved<193>nta through his ç
scholarly compositions, disputations and discourses. He had unique ç
yogic powers which he liberally used to uplift those that badly needed ç
succour.
In <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1671, at the age of 76, he sat in deep meditation ç
inside the B<216>nd<193>vana he had specially got prepared, which ç
was filled up over his living body. He is believed to be still alive ç
there, in his subtle body. This B<216>nd<193>vana is situated in the ç
village, then known as Ma<210>c<193>le, and now, as Mantr<193>laya ç
(See <MS>MANTR°LAYA<D>.).
It is claimed by his devotees that miracles are happening even now ç
due to his presence and powers.
Some of his works†which total 48† are: Ny<193>yasudh<193>parimal<193>; ç

A famous king of the S<220>ryava<221>·a (lineage from Sun-god) and ç
a distinguished scion of the Ik<218>v<193>ku race, he was the great-grandfather ç
of <185>r<200> R<193>ma. After him, the race itself came to be known ç
as Raghuva<221>·a.
After conquering the whole world, Raghu performed the Vi·vajit sacrifice ç
wherein he had to give away all his wealth and possessions. When the ç
sacrifice was over, the sage Kautsa (a disciple of Vi·v<193>mitra) ç
approached him for a very heavy gurudak<218>i<207><193> (fees to be ç
given to the preceptor). Seeing the indigent circumstances of the ç
king himself, Kautsa wasabout to depart. However, Raghu dissuaded ç
him and started preparing to attack Kubera, the god of wealth, who ç
rained gold coins on Ayodhy<193>, the capital city. Kautsa took what ç
he wanted, and left after blessing the king profusely.

The Hindu way of life, technically known as <193>c<193>ra (conduct ç
in daily life) and vyavah<193>ra (social dealings) was largely determined ç
by the sm<216>tis, the dharma-·<193>stras and the nibandhas (digests).
The last group of works comprises encyclopaedic  compositions  by  very ç
scholarly and competent authors. Raghunandana was one such who lived ç
in Bengal during the 16th century. He was the last of the great writers ç
on the dharma·<193>stras. His views on the various aspects of Hindu ç
civil law are considered with respect even now, especially in Bengal.
Raghunandana was a vandyagha<219><200>ya br<193>hma<207>a from Bengal. ç
His father was Harihara-bha<219><219><193>c<193>rya. His guru was ç
<185>r<200>n<193>tha-<193>c<193>rya-c<220><195><193>ma<207>i.
According to the Bengali tradition, Raghunandana was a co-pupil of ç
<185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a Caitanya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1485-1533) under ç
V<193>sudeva S<193>rvabhauma. However, there is no confirmation of ç
this from other sources.
Raghunandana's magnum opus is the Sm<216>titattva divided into 28 ç
sections, also called tattvas. It is an encyclopaedic nibandha work ç
on all aspects of dharma-·<193>stras.
The J<200>v<193>nanda edition printed in <MS>A.D.<D> 1895 is in two ç
volumes and has 1630 pages.
Some of the tattvas of this book are: Tithitattva, <185>uddhitattva, ç
°hnikatattva, <185>r<193>ddhatattva, Pr<193>ya·cittatattva, Sa<221>-sk<193>ratattva, ç
D<193>yatattva, Vyavah<193>ratattva, Devaprati<218><219>h<193>tattva ç
and so on.
His views on the ·<220>dras are very liberal. He has given them plenty ç
of freedom in religious matters.
Raghunandana was a master in the application of the rules of the M<200>m<193><221>s<193> ç
philosophy and the ny<193>yas or maxims, while discussing his subjects.

A very brief account of these vibh<193>gas may now be given here:
@S10N = 1.	Arth<193>nu·<193>sanavibh<193>ga (20 adhik<193>ras)
Introduction; the three secrets or mysteries as the essence of spiritual ç
practice; Arthapa<210>caka or the five essentials to be known; the ç
three fundamental principles known as Tattvatraya; qualifications ç
of a true aspirant; on prapatti or total surrender to God; a feeling ç
of fulfilment; need to perform the rites prescribed by the scriptures; ç
obviating the evil effects of transgressions; liberation.
@S10N = 2.	Sthir<200>kara<207>avibh<193>ga (4 adhik<193>ras)
God as the primary means of liberation; bhakti (devotion) and prapatti ç
(total surrender to God) as the secondary means; the need to keep ç
up the social disciplines as reflected in the var<207>a and <193>·rama ç
systems; a faithful description of the powers and limitations of prapatti.
@S10N = 3.	Padav<193>kyayojan<193>vibh<193>ga (3 adhik<193>ras)
Detailed  exposition  of  the  m<220>la- mantra (the a<218><219><193>k<218>ar<200> ç
or the eight-lettered mantra) comprising the pra<207>ava or Om, the ç
actual name of the Lord, N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, and the word nama<199> ç
(obeisance); expounding of the dvayamantra consisting of two parts, ç
which is the primary aspect of the practice of the prapanna (one who ç
has surrendered himself at the feet of the Lord); detailed elucidation ç
of the carama-·loka (Bhagavadg<200>t<193> 18.66) containing the ç
final message of the Lord.
@S10N = 4.	Samprad<193>yaprakriy<193>vibh<193>ga<R>ç

@NT = R<193>hu
@N1 = (`the siezer')
Hindu astrology lists nine grahas or celestial planets (called Navagrahas) ç
and recognises their effects on human life. The first seven are the ç
presiding deities of the seven days of the week. They are: Ravi (Sun), ç
Candra or Soma (Moon), Ma<209>gala (Mars), Budha (Mercury), Guru (Jupiter), ç
<185>ukra (Venus) and <185>ani (Saturn).
The last two are R<193>hu and Ketu, the two nodal points where the ç
celestial equator cuts the ecliptic.
These two are also considered as grahas or planets.
R<193>hu was the eldest son of the demon Vipracitti and Si<221>hik<193>. ç
Ilvala, V<193>t<193>pi and Naraka were among his younger brothers.
When Lord Vi<218><207>u as Mohin<200> was distributing am<216>ta (nectar) ç
among the gods, R<193>hu sneaked into their line disguised as a god. ç
When this was discovered, Vi<218><207>u cut off his head with his ç
famous discus. However, since R<193>hu had already consumed some am<216>ta, ç
he did not die. Both his head and the torso survived as two entities. ç
They came to be known as R<193>hu and Ketu, and were grouped among ç
the grahas or planets.
Iconographical works show R<193>hu just as a head, or as a snake-hood.
Sometimes he is shown in a human form riding a lion and with four ç
arms, carrying a sword, a lance and a shield in three hands and the ç
fourth showing the abhayamudr<193> (gesture of protection).
Other descriptions picture him with two hands, riding a silver chariot ç
drawn by eight horses. His left hand holds a book and the right is ç
empty.
It was believed that R<193>hu now and then swallowed the sun and the ç
moon, causing their eclipses, because it is they who discovered his ç
disguise and caused the severance of his body.
R<193>hu is a malefic planet. However, under certain circumstances, ç
he may also produce beneficial results.

@NT = Raid<193>s
@N1 = (15th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>)
Neither God nor his devotees recognise caste (based on birth) as an ç
important factor in social hierarchy. Many great leaders of the Bhakti ç
Movement in the Middle Ages belonged to the lower strata of the society. ç
One such was Raid<193>s (also called Ravid<193>s and Rohid<193>sa) ç
who lived in K<193>·<200> or V<193>r<193><207>as<200>.
Though born in a family of the c<193>m<193>ror cobbler caste, Raid<193>s ç
was deeply devoted to God and tried to lead a pure life. Driven out ç
of the house by an enraged father who could hardly understand his ç
spiritual aspirations, he set up his own home and business along with ç
his equally pious wife.
Hard-working and honest, he spent much of his time in singing the ç
names and glories of God.
He was one of the disciples of Sv<193>mi R<193>m<193>nanda (14th century ç
<MS>A.<|>D.<D>), the then famous saint of K<193>·<200>, and was a friend ç
of Kab<200>r (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1440-1518), another disciple of the same ç
teacher.
M<200>r<193>b<193><200> (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1547-1614), according to some ç
sources, was a disciple of his, as also the then queen of K<193>·<200>. ç
The former, however, is unlikely if he were a disciple of Sv<193>mi ç
R<193>m<193>nanda.
Some  of  his  compositions  like `prabhuj<200> tum candana ham p<193>n<200>' ç
are popular even today.
He is said to have lived for 120 years.
@NT = Raikva
@SPACE = 
@SPACE = 
J<193>na·ruti Pautr<193>ya<207>a was the king of Mah<193>v<216><218>a ç
and well-known for his generosity, especially for gifting food to ç
the poor and the needy. Once he over-heard two swans flying over his ç
palace, conversing between them. While one sang his praise, the other ç
belittled it saying that the sage Raikva was far superior to him.
Becoming curious about this Raikva, the king despatched his servants ç
in search of him. After a long search Raikva was located in a lonely ç
place, sitting under his cart and scratching his itches.
When the king approached him for the special knowledge in which he ç
was an adept, offering him wealth and his own daughter in marriage, ç
Raikva obliged by teaching him the Sa<221>varga Vidy<193>.
Sa<221>varga is that which absorbs other things into itself. V<193>yu ç
(the air or the wind) in the outside world and pr<193><207>a (thevital ç
air, the life force) inside the human body are the sa<221>vargas since ç
they, respectively, absorb into themselves the four cosmic objects ç
(sun, moon, fire and water) and the four internal organs (speech, ç
eyes, ears and mind).
J<193>na·ruti also gave Raikva, a number of villages. The whole area ç
came to be known as Raikvapar<207>a.
This story is recorded in the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad (4.3.1-8).
The Skandapur<193><207>a (Setukha<207><195>a 26) refers to a sage ç
Raikva, who was lame and always travelled by a bullock cart. Hence ç
he was called `Sayugva-Raikva', the `Raikva with a cart pulled by ç
two bullocks'.
He is said to have drawn to himself the three sacred rivers Ga<209>g<193>, ç
Yamun<193>, and Gay<193>, with the desire to bathe in them, to the ç
place (in the Gandham<193>dana mountains) where he lived. They manifested ç
themselves there as desired by him.
The two Raikvas appear to be the same.

Ancient Hindu scriptures recognised the great necessity for the office ç
of the king or the Supreme Head of the State. Otherwise, jungle-law ç
would prevail.
In the Vedic age, the kings were actually social leaders elected by ç
the people. The office of the king as a hereditary institution, seems ç
to be a later development. <|>Even <|>then, <|>the <|>people's consent ç
was taken before the appointment of the yuvar<193>ja (the crown prince) ç
who would later on succeed to the throne.
Most of the ancient kings traced their descent to S<220>rya (the Sun), ç
Candra (the Moon), or Agni (the Fire).

@N1 = (`duties of a king)
The duties and the responsibilities of a king or the ruler of a country, ç
have been delineated in great detail by the epics, the pur<193><207>as ç
and the dharma·<193>stras. Atrism<216>ti (28) summarises the whole ç
topic in a superb, though succinct, manner thus: `The five duties ç
of a king are: punishing the wicked, honouring the good, filling up ç
the treasury by right means, meting out justice impartially and protecting ç
the kingdom by all means at his disposal.'
Since the State depended heavily on the king, he was expected to possess ç
some basic qualities and proficiency in some fields like physical ç
strength and stamina, expertise in the use of weapons and missiles, ç
and a good knowledge of econo-mics as also political science. A basic ç
knowledge of the Vedas and logic was also necessary.
It was his primary duty to see thatall his subjects strictly ç
followed the codes of var<207>a-<193>·rama-dharma. The transgressors ç
were to be dealt with sternly.
The dharma·<193>stras ordained that the land of the country was not ç
his personal property, though he too could own some land and build ç
up his private property by the funds of the State allotted to him ç
for his maintenance.
The king had a fixed and strenuous daily routine. The legitimate activities ç
prescribed were: examining the financial position of the State; tax-collections; ç
preparing a balanced budget; planning welfare schemes for the people; ç
consultation with the ministers and important officers; secret meetings ç
with spies; inspection of armed forces and consultations with the ç
commanders; and, finally, spending some time with the members of his ç
own family.
Elaborate arrangements were made for the safety of the person of the ç
king.
The R<193>jadharma section of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata (vide <185><193>ntiparva, ç

The goddess of the Kail<193>san<193>tha temple at K<193><210>c<200>puram ç
in Tamil Nadu hasbeen called R<193>jar<193>je·var<200>, probably ç
because the temple had been built by the king Narasi<221>ha Varma ç
(the Second) (<MS>A.D.<D> 695-722) who had assumed the title, `R<193>jar<193>je·vara,' ç
(the king of kings').
The Lalit<193>sahasran<193>ma (684) uses this name as one of the ç
epithets of Lalit<193>(Tripurasundar<200>). There, the name is interpreted ç
as `one who is the mistress of even Brahm<193>, Vi<218><207>u, Mahe·vara ç
and Kubera'.
She is described elaborately in the works like the <186>o<195>a·<200>kalpa. ç
The Bhairav<200>-tantra includes her among the Da·amah<193>-vidy<193>s ç
(ten aspects of the Divine Mother). (See <MS>DA<185>AMAH°VIDY°S<D> ç
for details.)
She is pictured as sitting on the left lap of <185>iva, on a throne ç
with five deities (called `pretas' here) (Brahm<193>, Vi<218><207>u, ç
Rudra, ®·vara and Sad<193>·iva) forming its legs as it were.
She is extremely beautiful and bright, but of red complexion. She ç
has three eyes. The crescent moon illumines her crown. The sun and ç
full-moon form her ear-rings. Her face is tranquil and pleasant. She ç
is richly decorated with garlands and various kinds of jewels.

A r<193>jar<218>i is a king who has risen to the state and stature ç
of a <216><218>i or a sage, a person of spiritual wisdom. He has attained ç
that state by dint of severe tapas or austerity.
In ancient India, as a result of the education received in the gurukulas ç

trained to become men of spiritual wisdom.
Certain kinds of vidy<193>s (meditations) like the Pa<210>c<193>gni ç

One of the Vedic sacrifices mentioned often by the pur<193><207>as, ç
the R<193>jas<220>ya (-y<193>ga), could be performed only by a k<218>attriya ç
or a king.
Some authorities opined that it could be performed after the V<193>japeya ç
(another well-known sacrifice) while others felt that it should be ç
done before. The <185>atapatha Br<193>hma<207>a (9.3.4.8) declares ç
that one who performs the R<193>jas<220>ya becomes a r<193>jan (king) ç
whereas the performer of the V<193>japeya becomes a sa<221>r<193><219> ç
(emperor).
It is a rite of royal consecration and lasts for more than two years.
The yajam<193>na or the sacrificer has to take the d<200>k<218><193> ç
or preliminary vows on Ph<193>lguna-·ukla-pratipad (first day of the ç
bright half of the month of Ph<193>lguna, generally in February/March). ç
He then performs a Soma sacrifice called the Pavitra. The procedure ç
for this is the same as for the Agni<218><219>oma sacrifice. (See ç
<MS>AGNI<186><187>OMA<D> for details.)
@SPACE1 =

The most important part of the R<193>jas<220>ya is the Abhi<218>ecan<200>ya ç
rite (the rite of unction lasting for five days) wherein the water ç
for the abhi<218>eka (the act of pouring the water on the head) has ç
to be brought from seventeen sources, kept in seventeen vessels of ç
udumbara wood (Ficus glomearata) and poured on the sacrificer's ç
(the king's) head by several persons including the commoners.
Then there is a symbolic march for the plunder of cows. A group of ç
one hundred cows is `seized' by the king and then given back to their ç
owners.
A dice-play in which the sacrificer-king always wins is also a part ç
of the ritual.
As in other sacrifices, the sacrificer has to take the avabh<216>thasn<193>na ç

cows, to the various priests.

like the Artha·<193>stra of Kau<219>ilya (300 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) the ç
r<193>jy<193><209>gas or the constituents of a State are six. They ç
are: sv<193>min (king), mantripari<218>ad (council of ministers), ç
janapada (people), durga and bala (fort and armed forces), ko·a (treasury), ç
and mitra (allies).
@S10N = SV°MIN (The King)
The ancient and medieval works onpolitical science recognized the ç
great necessity for the office of the king or the supreme Head of ç
the State. Since everything concerning the State ultimately depended ç
upon him, he was expected to possess some basic qualities and proficiency ç
in some specified fields. They were: physical strength and stamina, ç
expertise in the use of astras (missiles) and ·astras (weapons) and ç
a good knowledge of the four branches of learning viz., tray<200> ç
(the Vedas), <193>nv<200>k<218>ik<200> (logic), v<193>rt<193> (economics ç
and political science) and da<207><195>an<200>ti (statecraft). To ç
understand the basic principles of dharma and act according to them ç
he must have been properly educated, refined and cultured. Needless ç
to say that self-control was an essential part of this training.
Since the stability of the society depended on the strict maintenance ç
of dharma by all concerned, and since the var<207>a-<193>·rama-system ç
was considered pivotal to it, the king was expected to enforce it ç
strictly. In the process he was obliged to deal with the transgressors ç
very sternly.
Contrary to the Western concept that the king was the owner of all ç
the land over which he ruled, the Hindu dharma-·<193>stras ordained ç
that the land did not belong to him as he was only its trustee. ç
However he could have a private property built up from the funds allotted ç
to him in the management of the State. Consequently he could give ç
gifts only from this!
The king had a fixed, but strenuous, daily routine. Sufficient time ç
was allotted for all legitimate activities such as these: examining ç
the income and expenditure position, preparing a balanced budget, ç
tax- collections, planning welfare schemes for the people, consultations ç
with the ministers, secret meeting with the spies bringing information, ç
inspection of the armed forces and consultation with its officers, ç
spending some time with the family members and personal prayers.
It goes without saying that always elaborate and strict arrangements ç
were made for the personal safety of the king.
Kings who aspired to become empe-rors cherished a great desire to ç
perform sacrifices like the R<193>jas<220>ya or A·vamedha.
@S10N = MANTRIPARI<186>AD (Council of Ministers)
The ministry was usually in two tiers†the inner or core group and ç
the outer, larger, council. The inner, the core, group comprised the ç
crown-prince, the prime minister, the royal preceptor (r<193>jaguru) ç
and the commander-in-chief. All policy decisions and framing of laws ç
were done by this inner group. The outer circle could consist of 8 ç
to 23, or even more, persons. They were important officers and heads ç
of departments. This outer circle was mainly concerned with the implementation ç
of the decisions taken by the inner circle.
The king was expected not to go against the majority decisions.
@SPACE = 
@S10N = JANAPADA (People)
@SPACE1 = 
Since the kingdom, the entire govern- mental system, is meant for ç
the welfare of the people, they must be kept happy and contented. ç
For this they need security and all opportunities for development. ç
The primary means of achieving this is by giving them food, clothing, ç
shelter, health-care, education and avenues for employment. Hence, ç
the king and his government must support and encourage all organizations ç
of public service such as trade guilds, labour unions, educational ç
institutions and self-government agencies like the pa<210>c<193>yats. ç
As far as possible, all welfare activities must be undertaken through ç
them or with their cooperation.

@S10N = DURGA AND BALA<R>ç
(Forts and Armed Forces)
@SPACE1 = 
During those days, forts were extremely important for the defence ç
system. They used to be built in important places,including the inaccessible ç
ones, for emergencies. Vantage points were always preferred. They ç
would have outer and inner structures, secret tunnels, proper places ç
for the soldiers, weapons, treasury, food and other essential commodities, ç
and even secret places for hiding. Food and essential commodities ç
were always kept in stock.
The  espionage  system  was  well- organized.
There were proper provisions and methods for the raising and training ç
of the armed forces which consisted of four divisions: infantry, cavalry, ç
chariot-force and elephant-force.
Since ship-building was well-known even in the early period, powerful ç
navies formed part of the armed forces.
During wars and invasions, very strict rules were followed. A few ç
of these are:
The soldiers should not fight with unarmed persons. Weak persons, ç
women and children, sick people and refugees must never be harmed. ç
No damage should be caused to agricultural fields and civilian industries. ç
There should be no looting or molestation in the conquered territory. ç
Local religions and customs must be honoured  and  never  interfered  with. ç
Closest relative of the conquered king, if found fit, may be installed ç
as the new king. He was to be a s<193>manta (feudatory chief) paying ç
tributes and supplying the army when the conquering king needs it. ç
He had complete autonomy in all other respects.
People of the conquered country had to be befriended by proper means.
@S10N = KO<185>A (Treasury)
No activity of the State can be undertaken unless there is enough ç
money and wealth to back it up. Hence, collection of taxes was a primary ç
duty of the State.
The taxes levied were generally light or moderate, and never heavy. ç
Land revenue was the main tax. Irrigation tax was also collected wherever ç
irrigation had been provided. The tax was generally one-sixth or one-fifth ç
of the produce. Arts, crafts and trades were also taxed. Reli-gious ç
and educational institutions, disabled persons, unemployed people, ç
s<193>dhus (recluses and monks) and br<193>hma<207>as (devoted to ç
Vedic learning and an austere life) were exempted. During droughts, ç
famines and other national emergencies taxes were either abolished ç
or deferred.
Emergency funds were built up in a separate treasury and were never ç
touched except in grave and critical situations.*
There was a constant and strict supervision of accounts. Tax-collectors ç
were expected to behave humanely and invited severe punishments for ç
cruelty.
The tax money was apportioned to various public purposes by proper ç
budge-tary procedures.
@S10N = MITRA (Ally)
For the consolidation of the State and help in emergencies, friends ç
and allies were considered absolutely necessary. The first two of ç
the four up<193>yas or means, viz., s<193>ma (a spirit of reconciliation) ç
and d<193>na (the spirit of give and take), come in handy in this ç
regard. (The other two†bheda [splitting the enemy ranks] and da<207><195>a ç
[violent means including war]† were meant to be used against enemies ç
and that too as a last resort.)
Potential enemies, when not amenable to s<193>ma and d<193>na, were ç
to be neutralized.
Friendly countries were to be helped in their hour of need. Pacts ç
signed were strictly honoured. There was to be no invasion on a king ç
who was virtuous and was ruling according to dharma!

to the power of the amulet tied on his hand by his queen <185>ac<200>dev<200> ç

festival. The rak<218><193>s or r<193>kh<200>s, prepared out of golden ç

@NT = r<193>k<218>asas
@N1 = (`beings from whom one seeks to protect oneself,' `demons')
The pur<193><207>as and the epics mention various kinds of living ç
beings in creation, of which the r<193>k<218>asas are also one type.
The words asuras (antigods), daityas (sons of Diti, a wife of the ç
sage Ka·yapa) and d<193>navas (sons of Danu, another wife of Ka·yapa) ç
are also often applied to them.
Though the general belief is that the r<193>k<218>asas are extremely ç
evil, wicked or malevolent spirits, they represent more a race or ç
species of beings which can be broadly divided into three groups:
1) The y<193>tudh<193>nas and yak<218>as who are by nature good, benevolent ç
and skilful. They are semidivine and possess magical powers.
2) The titans, who are huge in size and mighty in strength. They are ç
evil by nature. It is to kill them that the major gods like Vi<218><207>u, ç
<185>iva or Dev<200> appear in various forms.
3) The nakta<210>caras (demons and fiends) who wander about during ç
nights, devouring human beings; and disturbing the penances of ascetics ç
as also the sacrifices of the sages. 
The r<193>k<218>asas are generally described as ugly, misshaped and ç
with terrible tusks. They wear blue garments, live upon human flesh ç
and become very powerful during nights.
They live below the solar regions.
In iconography, their images are shown in twelve t<193>las (See <MS>M<188>RTI<185>ILPA-<185>°STRA<D> ç

Though eternally at loggerheads, the devas (gods) and the d<193>navas ç
or r<193>k<218>asas (demons) were cousins, born of the same father, ç
the sage Ka·yapa. Quite a few among the d<193>navas distinguished ç
themselves as great devotees of Vi<218><207>u or <185>iva. A few are: ç

Viv<193>ha or marriage has been listed by the sm<216>tis and dharma·<193>stras ç
as one of the sixteen sa<221>sk<193>ras or sacraments.
Most of these works narrate eight forms of marriage, of which the ç
r<193>k<218>asaviv<193>ha is also one. It is actually equivalent to ç
forcible abduction and rape in its crudest form and is a punishable ç
offence in civilised societies. It is not even fit to be called viv<193>ha ç
or marriage in the strictest sense of the term. It was included in ç
the list only because it existed in certain primitive and barbarous ç
societies. Perhaps it represented a kind of war-booty.
In course of time, as people settled down in towns and villages, building ç
a civilised society, this form of marriage became a symbolical one, ç
especially among the k<218>attriyas (warrior class) and very often, ç
with the consent of the girl.
The classic examples found in the epics and the pur<193><207>as are ç
