the world has evolved.
The two-lettered word `R<193>ma' can give bhoga (enjoyments here) ç
or mok<218>a (liberation) as per the aspirant's desire since it contains ç
in itself the meaning of the famous Ved<193>ntic dictum tat tvam ç

The Upani<218>ad concludes with the eulogy of the R<193>mamantra which ç

@NT = R<193>mat<200>rtha
The Ved<193>ntas<193>ra of Sad<193>nanda (17th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) ç
is a well-known primary text-book of Advaita Ved<193>nta, popular ç
among the students of Ved<193>nta. Out of the three Sanskrit commentaries ç
on it available now in print, the Vidvanmanora<210>jan<200> of R<193>mat<200>rtha ç
is also one. Nothing is known about him except that he was a disciple ç
of Sv<193>mi K<216><218><207>at<200>rtha and might have lived during ç
the 17th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>
His commentary is simple and lucid.
@NT = R<193>mat<200>rtha, Sv<193>mi
@N1 = (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1873-1906)
One  of  the  well-known  Hindu religious leaders of recent times, ç
Sv<193>mi R<193>mat<200>rtha was born in a small village Miraliwala ç
of Punjab (now in Pakistan) as the second son of Gosv<193>mi H<200>r<193>nanda, ç
who was a poor br<193>hma<207>a priest. His original name was Gosv<193>mi ç
T<200>rthar<193><221>. He lost his mother at an early age and was ç
brought up by his elder brother and sister-in-law.
Thanks to his sharp intellect, he got a good education not only in ç
Sanskrit, Urdu and Persian, but also in Ved<193>nta, under competent ç
teachers like Dharm<193>r<193>m and B<193>b<193> Nag<200>nsi<221>ha ç
Ved<200> in Gujaranwala.
In his twentythird year, he became a professor of mathematics in the ç
Foreman Christian College of Lahore (now in Pakistan).
Religious by nature and given to contemplation on God, he was deeply ç
influenced by Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1863-1902)  when  the  latter  visited ç
Lahore.
Though married at a young age, he left the family in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1901, and took sa<221>ny<193>sa (monastic life) assuming the new name ç
Sv<193>mi R<193>mat<200>rtha. After performing severe austerities ç
in the Him<193>layas he returned to his native place and then travelled ç
to Japan and the U.S.A. where he lectured on the Ved<193>nta. His ç
pure life, attractive personality and oratory made him quite popular.
He wrote a number of articles on the need to attain political freedom.
He always stressed two things: not accepting anything without proper ç
reasoning; and, working for the good of others, especially our motherland.
Himself possessing a strong physique he also advocated exercising ç
the body as equally import for spiritual life and service to mankind.
He died by drowning in the river Ga<209>g<193>, probably of his own ç
accord, in <MS>A.D.<D> 1906.
@NT = R<193>m<193>ya<207>a
@SB = 1.	Introduction
If there is one holy book that has profoundly influenced the life, ç
the thought and the culture of millions of Hindus over the millennia, ç
it is, undoubtedly, the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a of V<193>lm<200>ki. ç
No aspect of Hindu religion and culture, whether it is literature, ç
drama, music, art or sculpture, has remained unaffected by it.
There also seems to be, apparently, no place in the Indian sub-continent ç
that has not had the privilege of being visited by R<193>ma and S<200>t<193> ç
or Lak<218>ma<207>a and Hanum<193>n! This rock contains the footprint ç
of R<193>ma; that mountain split into two, unable to bear the weight ç
of Hanum<193>n; the water of this rivulet is coloured since S<200>t<193> ç
had washed her clothes†this is how, even now, the simple folk of rural ç
India weave an affectionate bond between themselves and the immaculate ç
heroes of the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a.
Hence, a reverent study of this wonderful work can certainly contribute ç
to the levelling up of our culture in the social field and add an ç
inch or two to our inner evolution and elevation.
@SB = 2.	Historicity of the R<193>ma Story
There is a fundamental difference between the Occidental and the Hindu ç
concepts of history. For the former, an incident that had really ç
occurred, its dateor time or period as also the location, is all-important. ç
An implement of stone, a piece of pottery or an ancient coin discovered ç
during archaeological excavations are more valuable as `evidence' ç
for the existence or the occurrence of that incident than whether ç
it has left its imprint on the future generations or not. On the other ç
hand, the existence of persons or the occurrence of incidents in the ç
past are completely ignored by the Hindu psyche if they have not had ç
any impact† good or bad†on the life and manners or the culture of ç
the future generations.
Another basic difference should also be noted. If the West looks at ç
time as a linear thing with a beginning and an end, the Hindu mind ç
views it as cyclic and hence without beginning or end. The division ç
of time into Yugas and Manvantaras, of immense durations, should be ç
looked at from this angle.
Due to this inherent (self-imposed?) limitation, the Occidental scholars ç
do not accept the historical existence of R<193>ma and just pass off ç
the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a as a poetical work with mythical contents.
From this, one should not jump to the conclusion that the Hindus have ç
never paid any attention to history in their literary works and accounts. ç
Both the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a and the Mah<193>bh<193>rata†which ç
are specifically termed as `itih<193>sas' (`thus, verily, did it occur')†as ç
also a number of pur<193><207>as have given enough astronomical data ç
connected with all the important incidents narrated by them that it ç
is possible to work upon them and extract the exact dates in terms ç
of the Gregorian Calendar. According to one such attempt, the following ç
are the dates specified for some of the incidents in the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a:*
@L3 = Birth of R<193>ma	†	4439 <MS>B.C.<D><R>ç
His Banishment 	†	4414 <MS>B.C.<D><R>ç
His Coronation	†	4400 <MS>B.C.<D>
Suffice it to say that the Hindu religio-cultural tradition has accorded ç
the R<193>ma story a far greater reality, which does not preclude ç
the historical aspect.
@SB = 3.	V<193>lm<200>ki and His Work
Mahar<218>i V<193>lm<200>ki, the celebrated author of this great poem, ç
the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, is also one of the personages appearing ç
in the R<193>ma story. He is one of the earliest sages whose hermitage ç
R<193>ma visits in his sojourn through the forest after leaving Ayodhy<193>. ç
When R<193>ma banishes S<200>t<193>, it is V<193>lm<200>ki who shelters ç
her and rears up her twin sons. Though the author, and a contemporary ç
of the heroes in the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, he gives pretty little ç
information about himself. This is as it should be, since he was a ç
sage who had dedicated his life to contemplation on God and service ç
to humanity.
He has revealed that he is a son of the sage Pracetas (sometimes identified ç
with Varu<207>a). Lava and Ku·a, his disciples who sang the epic poem ç
in the court of R<193>ma himself, introduced themselves as the pupils ç
of Bhagav<193>n V<193>lm<200>ki, a Bh<193>rgava (of the lineage of ç
the sage Bh<216>gu).
Piecing together the stories given in other works like the Adhy<193>tma ç
R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, the °nanda R<193>m<193>ya<207>a and the ç
Bh<193>gavata this much can be said about him: He was a br<193>hma<207>a ç
by birth belonging to the lineage of Bh<216>gu. Fate consigned him ç
to a family of robbers which brought him up. Accidental contact with ç
the Saptar<218>is (the Seven Sages) or with the sage N<193>radachanged ç
his life. By the repetition of R<193>man<193>ma (the name of R<193>ma) ç
he attain-ed the supreme state of a mahar<218>i or `great sage'. Since ç
a valm<200>ka or an anthill had grown over his body during his long ç
period of austerities and since he emerged out of it when called, ç
he came to be known as `V<193>lm<200>ki'.
The story of the origin of the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a is given in ç
the epic itself, in the beginning. Once, N<193>rada arrived at the ç
hermitage of V<193>lm<200>ki who received him with due honour and ç
courtesies. Then he put a question to N<193>rada enquiring whether ç
there was anyone living at that time, embodying in himself sixteen ç
great and noble qualities that go to make a perfect man. In reply ç
N<193>rada gave him the story of R<193>ma in brief.
Then, immersed in the thought current of this story, V<193>lm<200>ki ç
left for the river Tamas<193> for his ablutions. There he witnessed ç
the killing by a hunter of a male bird that was in love with its mate. ç
The piteous wailing of the distressed female moved the heart of the ç
sage so much that he spontaneously uttered a curse on the hunter. ç
However, this curse came out of his mouth in the form of a `·loka,' ç
a perfectly metrical composition, which surprised the sage himself. ç
When he returned to his hermitage, Brahm<193> (the four-faced God, ç
the Creator), appeared to him and commanded him to compose an epic ç
poem on the story of R<193>ma as he had heard it from the great sage ç
N<193>rada, in this newly discovered metre. He also gave him the boon ç
of the visions of all the incidents and the revelation of all the ç
secrets connected with the story.
Accordingly V<193>lm<200>ki composed this epic, christened it as R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
(`The Wayor the Conduct or The Life-story of R<193>ma') and taught ç
it to Lava and Ku·a, the twin children of R<193>ma and S<200>t<193>, ç
through whom it gained vide currency and acclamation.

If the Hindu traditional view is accepted, then the date of V<193>lm<200>ki ç

However, the modern Western scholars and their Indian counterparts ç
are wont to assign a much later period to this scripture, 400-200 ç
<MS>B.C.<D> Theories are also not wanting that try to trace the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
to the Da·aratha J<193>taka of theBuddhists or identify R<193>ma ç
with a Pharaoh of Egypt. They deserve to be ignored.

Over  the  years,  the  R<193>m<193>ya<207>a scholars have struggled ç
to discover which part of the text is the original and which is prak<218>ipta ç

to confer great religious merit.
@SB = 6.	The Story in Brief
@S10 = B°LAK°Ø£A
Da·aratha, the king of Kosala, was ruling from Ayodhy<193>, the impregnable ç
and matchless capital. An invincible warrior, a just and kind ruler, ç
he had everything in life except worthy sons to succeed him to the ç
throne in course of time.
As per the advice of the sage Vasi<218><219>ha, the royal priest, ç
he performed the A·vamedha sacri-fice followed by the Putrak<193>me<218><219>i ç
rite, under the guidance of the well-known sage <184><218>ya·<216><209>ga. ç
From the sacrificial fire there arose a divine being who delivered ç
a vessel of p<193>yasa or pudding to Da·aratha, instructing him to ç
give it to his three queens†Kausaly<193>, Sumitr<193> and Kaikey<200>†so ç
that they could bear him virtuous sons.
In course of time Kausaly<193>, the chief queen, gave birth to R<193>ma, ç
Sumitr<193> to the twins Lak<218>ma<207>a and <185>atrughna, and, ç
Kaikey<200> to Bharata.
Under the loving care of the parents and the watchful eyes of the ç
preceptors, the children grew into boyhood. Lak<218>ma<207>a was very ç
fond of R<193>ma and liked to be with him always. <185>atrughna was ç
more attached to Bharata.
One day Vi·v<193>mitra, the warrior turned sage, arrived at the court ç
of Da·aratha and asked for sending R<193>ma with him to protect his ç
sacrifice against the depradations of the demons M<193>r<200>ca and ç
Sub<193>hu. Hesitant at first, the king yielded and sent R<193>ma ç
and Lak<218>ma<207>a with him. The two brothers successfully completed ç
their assignment. And, in the company of that great sage, through ç
his various journeys up to Mithil<193>, the capital city of the King ç
Janaka, they gained a vast knowledge of various subjects including ç
the science of archery, of weapons and of war.
At Mithil<193>, the capital of Videha, Vi·v<193>mitra took R<193>ma ç
and Lak<218>ma<207>a to the king Janaka and requested him to show ç
the <185>ivadhanus, the massive bow of Lord <185>iva, to the boys.
Janaka had a daughter S<200>t<193>, the paragon of feminine grace ç
and virtues. He had declared that any prince or warrior who could ç
string the <185>ivadhanus, would get her hand. Since a host of princes ç
and warriors including the mighty ones had miserably failed to pass ç
the test, Janaka was a worried person. He now got it brought to the ç
assembly hall and showed it to R<193>ma and Lak<218>ma<207>a. At the ç
instance of Vi·v<193>mitra, R<193>ma effortlessly lifted it up and ç
tried to string it. In the process, unable to bear the pressure of ç
his might, the bow broke into two with a thunderous noise. Janaka ç
and his family were extremely pleased.
Da·aratha and his queens were summoned to Mithil<193> and the marriage, ç
not only of R<193>ma but also of the other three princes with suitable ç
brides, was celebrated with due <F20W1>Ç<F255D>clat.
@SPACE1 = 
All of them returned to Ayodhy<193>. On the way, R<193>ma vanquished ç
Para·ur<193>ma, the ruthless exterminator of the K<218>attriya race ç
who retired for penance.
@S10 = AYODHY°K°Ø£A
After a few years, Da·aratha, who was getting old, decided to anoint ç
R<193>ma as the Yuvar<193>ja (heir apparent) and retire. As the news ç
got wind, the whole of Ayodhy<193> went agog over it. Kaikey<200>, ç
the third of the queens who had captivated the heart of Da·aratha ç
by her beauty, was incited by Manthar<193>, her crooked maid, to intercede ç
with the king on behalf of her son Bharata and demand the kingdom ç
for him. Simultaneously, R<193>ma was to be banished to the forest ç
for fourteen years. An unfulfilled boon given by Da·aratha to Kaikey<200>, ç
came in handy at this juncture and the physical absence of the noble ç
prince Bharata†who was away at his uncle's place†made things easy. ç
Caught in a trap as it were, Da·aratha had to helplessly acquiesce ç
in.
R<193>ma readily agreed to fulfil his father's word. Along with S<200>t<193> ç
and Lak<218>ma<207>a, who importuned him to accompany him, he left ç
for the forest. Da·aratha, unable to bear the separation from R<193>ma, ç
his dearest son, passed away in great agony.
@EMERGENCY = Meanwhile Bharata and <185>atrughna were called back ç
urgently by Vasi<218><219>ha, the royal preceptor. After returning ç
to Ayodhy<193> and learning of the tragic events, Bharata, nobility ç
incarnate, railed against his mother Kaikey<200>, refused to accept ç
the kingdom and started for the forest, vowing to bring back R<193>ma.
When, at last, Bharata succeeded in meeting R<193>ma at Citrak<220><219>a ç
in the forest and begged him to return, R<193>ma refused. Since it ç
was equally incumbent on Bharata to rule the kingdom for fourteen ç
years, to fulfil the word given by Da·aratha to Kaikey<200>, R<193>ma ç
persuaded him to return to Ayodhy<193>. Bharata did so, taking the ç
p<193>duk<193>s or the sandals of R<193>ma, which he coronated as ç
the `King.' He lived at Nandigr<193>ma, a little village, away from ç
Ayodhy<193>, like a forest recluse, managing the affairs of the State ç
as R<193>ma's regent.
@S10 = ARAØYAK°Ø£A
Now R<193>ma, along with S<200>t<193> and Lak<218>ma<207>a, started ç
moving in the forest going deeper, and farther towards the south, ç
visiting the hermitages of many a great sage. Finally, after spending ç
more than ten years, they settled down at Pa<210>cava<219><200> in ç
the Da<207><195>aka forest.
One  day  <185><220>rpa<207>akh<193>,  an  ugly demoness with uglier ç
intentions, came there. Captivated by R<193>ma's matchless beauty ç
she beseeched him to marry her. When R<193>ma and Lak<218>ma<207>a ç
were having some fun at her expense, she tried to attack S<200>t<193>. ç
At this, Lak<218>ma<207>a cut off her nose and ears as a punishment, ç
as per R<193>ma's directions. She went to Khara, the demon chief, ç
an overlord of this area of the forest and complained to him against ç
R<193>ma. However, when Khara came and attacked R<193>ma with his ç
huge army of 14,000 demons, R<193>ma, singlehanded, decimated them. ç
The enraged and hapless, but vengeful, <185><220>rpa<207>akh<193>, ç
approached R<193>va<207>a her brother and the king of La<209>k<193>, ç
to avenge her humiliation. However, knowing R<193>va<207>a's weakness ç
for women, she was wily enough to describe the bewitching beauty of ç
S<200>t<193>, the spouse of R<193>ma. Roused more by lust than by ç
anger, R<193>va<207>a approached M<193>r<200>ca, his erstwhile lieutenant ç
and a past-master in cheating, to assist him in abducting S<200>t<193> ç
from the Pa<210>cava<219><200>. Unable to dissuade R<193>va<207>a ç
from  his  nefarious  designs,  M<193>r<200>ca assumed the form of ç
a golden deer, enticed S<200>t<193> to hanker for it and beg R<193>ma ç
to catch it for her. R<193>ma pursued it endlessly. Failing to capture ç
it alive, he killed it. M<193>r<200>ca, while dying uttered a loud ç
cry, `Oh S<200>t<193>! Oh Lak<218>ma<207>a!' imitating the voice of ç
R<193>ma. On hearing this, S<200>t<193>, out of consternation, forced ç
Lak<218>ma<207>a much against his will, to go to the rescue of R<193>ma. ç
Finding her all alone, R<193>va<207>a abducted her and carried her ç
away to La<209>k<193>. Ja<219><193>yu, the giant vulture, a friend ç
of R<193>ma, fought with R<193>va<207>a in vain to rescue S<200>t<193> ç
and became a martyr. Keeping her presence of mind, S<200>t<193> while ç
being abducted, dropped some of her ornaments among some monkeys perched ç
on a mountain top. R<193>v<193><207>a, after reaching La<209>k<193> ç
kept her captive in his pleasure garden, the A·okavana.
R<193>ma and Lak<218>ma<207>a returned to their hermitage, found S<200>t<193> ç
missing and started a vigorous search. In this process they encountered ç
a demon Kabandha and killed him (thereby redeeming him from a curse). ç
Then they met <185>abar<200>, a woman-hermit of the forest tribe, ç
accepted her hospitality and started towards the <184><218>yam<220>ka ç
hill as per her advice with a view to meeting Sugr<200>va, the v<193>nara ç
or monkey chieftain.
@S10 = KI<186>KINDH°K°Ø£A
Sugr<200>va, of the royal family of the kingdom of Ki<218>kindh<193>, ç
was living on the <184><218>yam<220>ka hill, being banished by his ç
elder brother V<193>li, who had also taken away his wife. R<193>ma ç
forged friendship with him, killed V<193>li and restored the Ki<218>kindh<193> ç
kingdom to Sugr<200>va who was duly crowned. Sugr<200>va promised ç
to search for S<200>t<193> and help R<193>ma to recover her.
Later, Sugr<200>va despatched his monkeys in all directions to find ç
out the whereabouts of S<200>t<193>. Since he and his able minister ç
Hanum<193>n had seen a lady in distress in an aircraft, along with ç
a monstrous figure, flying towards the south, he sent the more able ç
of his troops to the south under the leadership of A<209>gada (V<193>li's ç
son) and Hanum<193>n. This group arrived at the shore of the southern ç
sea and started deliberating as to how to crossit.
@S10 = SUNDARAK°Ø£A
After some discussions among themselves, it was finally decided that ç
Hanum<193>n should be deputed to go to La<209>k<193> on behalf of ç
them all. Accordingly he enlarged his body to massive proportions, ç
using his special yogic powers, and crossed the ocean in one leap, ç
overcoming all the obstacles on the way. After a thorough search, ç
he found S<200>t<193> in the A·oka grove, successfully talked to her, ç
delivered to her the signet ring of R<193>ma, took her c<220><195><193>ma<207>i ç
(crown jewel) to be given to R<193>ma as also her message, and returned ç
to the other shore after doing immense havoc to the city of La<209>k<193> ç
and its ruler.
When R<193>ma got all the news, he ordered Sugr<200>va to mobilse ç
his troops and march to the seashore.
@S10 = YUDDHAK°Ø£A
When the army was camping on the seashore, Vibh<200><218>a<207>a, ç
younger brother of R<193>va<207>a, alighted there from La<209>k<193> ç
and sought refuge at the feet of R<193>ma along with his four comrades. ç
He had tried hard, but in vain, to prevail upon R<193>va<207>a to ç
return S<200>t<193> to R<193>ma and gain his friendship, thereby saving ç
himself, his city and his subjects from utter disaster. R<193>va<207>a ç
had not only spurned his sage advice but had positively humiliated ç
him. Hence Vibh<200><218>a<207>a, being a righteous person, had abandoned ç
R<193>va<207>a and joined R<193>ma.
After successfully building a bridge across the sea, the entire army ç
of R<193>ma crossed over it, reaching the outskirts of La<209>k<193>. ç
R<193>ma's final efforts at peace by trying to induce some sanity ç
in the heart of R<193>va<207>a and get back S<200>t<193> without war ç
and bloodshed, failed due to R<193>va<207>a's obstinacy. A terrific ç
war ensued resulting in immense loss of life on both sides. There ç
were periods of great tension and anxiety for R<193>ma and his army, ç
as for instance when R<193>ma and Lak<218>ma<207>a were downed by ç
the serpent missiles of Indrajit or when Lak<218>ma<207>a was struck ç
unconscious by the ·akti-missile of R<193>va<207>a. However, all such ç
crises were overcome and all the dead in R<193>ma's army were restored ç
to lifeby the breeze of the Sa<210>j<200>van<200> mountain brought ç
by Hanum<193>n. All the great warriors of R<193>va<207>a's army including ç
Kumbhakar<207>a (the giant brother of R<193>va<207>a) and Indrajit ç
(R<193>va<207>a's son) were slain. Finally R<193>va<207>a too was ç
killed by R<193>ma thereby bringing the war to a close.
@SPACE1 = 
Then R<193>ma put Vibh<200><218>a<207>a on the throne of La<209>k<193> ç
and accepted S<200>t<193>, after she underwent the fire-ordeal. By ç
this time, fourteen years of banishment had been completed.
All of them now returned to Ayodhy<193> and met Bharata and the queen-mothers.
R<193>ma was then crowned as the king and S<200>t<193> as the queen ç
at a joyous and pompous ceremony.
The reign of R<193>ma (R<193>mar<193>jya) was ideal in every sense ç
of the term and all were extremely happy. It lasted for a long time.
@S10 = UTTARAK°Ø£A
Being overjoyed at the destruction of R<193>va<207>a and the establishment ç
of R<193>ma-r<193>jya, a number of sages, under the leadership of ç
Agastya arrived at R<193>ma's palace. After R<193>ma duly honoured ç
them, Agastya narrated the stories of R<193>va<207>a and others in ç
detail, just to make him understand how powerful and formidable they ç
were. Then they returned to their hermitages.
One day R<193>ma learnt from his spies about the rumours current in ç
Ayodhy<193> and elsewhere accusing him of impropriety in bringing ç
back S<200>t<193> to his house even though she resided in R<193>va<207>a's ç
house forquite some time. Shocked at this, R<193>ma decided to banish ç
S<200>t<193> to the forest and accordingly instructed Lak<218>ma<207>a ç
to implement it. S<200>t<193>, who was then pregnant, was given shelter ç
by the sage V<193>lm<200>ki whose hermitage was near the place where ç
she had been abandoned. In course of time she gave birth to twins. ç
They were named Lava and Ku·a, and were brought up by the sage in ç
a manner that befits princes.
Some sages under the leadership of Bh<193>rgava and Cyavana came to ç
R<193>ma and complained to him against the demon Lava<207><193>sura. ç
R<193>ma instructed <185>atrughna to go to Madhupur<200>, the capital ç
city ofLava<207>a and destroy him. <185>atrughna accomplished the ç
task easily and was crowned as the king there. He ruled for twelve ç
years.
Once the young son of a br<193>hma<207>a died and the br<193>hma<207>a ç
blamed it on R<193>ma since it was an untimely death. Such deaths ç
could take place only when there was adharma or unrighteousness in ç
the kingdom. It was found out that a ·<220>dra, <185>amb<220>ka by ç
name, was practising severe austerities, which was against the norms ç
of that age. Hence R<193>ma was obliged to kill him.
Years passed. R<193>ma decided to perform the A·vamedha sacrifice ç
in the Naimi·a forest. All arrangements were made. V<193>lm<200>ki ç
decided to attend the sacrifice along with his disciples including ç
Lava and Ku·a. They were instructed to sing the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
in all places of the sacrifice. They did so. Even R<193>ma heard it ç
and was charmed by it. Later, when he learnt that they were his own ç
children he sent word to V<193>km<200>ki that S<200>t<193> should ç
come to his court and reassert her purity. Though V<193>lm<200>ki ç
brought her and she did reassert her fidelity to R<193>ma she also ç
prayed to Mother Earth from whom she had emerged at the time of her ç
supernatural birth, to take her away! The ground split into two and ç
from it emerged Bh<220>dev<200> (Mother Earth) with a throne. Seating ç
S<200>t<193> on that throne, by her side, she disappeared forever.
@SPACE1 = 
The period of R<193>ma's life on earth was fast coming to an end. ç
So, the K<193>lapuru<218>a (personified time) arrived at Ayodhy<193> ç
to remind R<193>ma that his play on earth was over and that it was ç
time that he return to his abode.
Due to the intrigue of the inexorable fate,  R<193>ma  was  obliged  to  banish ç
Lak<218>ma<207>a  who  was  taken  away  by Devendra to heaven.
After coronating his sons Lava and Ku·a, R<193>ma retired to the Saray<220> ç
river and then to his divine abode, after giving salvation to all ç
the people of Ayodhy<193> and others who had accompanied him to the ç
banks of the Saray<220> river.
@SB = 7.	The Characters of the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a
Before delving into the study of thevarious characters of the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, ç
especially of R<193>ma, one should carefully note the main purpose ç
of the work itself. V<193>lm<200>ki was a tapasv<200>, a holy man, ç
who had practised severe austerities to realise the Truth within and ç
to serve the society through the power of that realisation. It was ç
not his intention to compose this epic poem nor was he a poet, competent ç
enough to accomplish it. The simple question he put to N<193>rada, ç
the great sage, was to know out of curiosity, whether a perfect man ç
existed then, who had in him all the great qualities that bespeak ç
of a perfect being. He himself listed sixteen such qualities. If one ç
did exist, he could as well become a model for the whole humanity ç
to emulate. While admitting that it was difficult for a human being ç
to possess even a fraction of these great qualities,<|> N<193>rada<|>gladly<|><|>confessed ç
to <|>the<|><|>existence of such a remarkable man, R<193>ma by name, ç
the king of Ayodhy<193>, of the race of Ik<218>v<193>ku, who possessed ç
these qualities in abundance and gave his story in brief. He even ç
indicated the divinity of that personage.
Brahm<193>, the Creator, chose V<193>lm<200>ki as the instrument through ç
whom the story of R<193>ma the perfect being, was to be widely disseminated, ç
infilled him with the necessary power and commanded him to compose ç
this great work. Hence, the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a that issued forth ç
was a divinely ordained work, aimed at providing an ideal man to the ç
world so that all the human beings could shape their own lives in ç
his mould.
Dharma is the keynote of this lyric poem. It is the basic principle ç
that supports the whole universe. It expresses itself as conscience ç
within and duties and obligations without. R<193>ma is its most complete ç
representation so much so that he has become synonymous for dharma ç
for ages at a stretch.
Other characters like Lak<218>ma<207>a, Bharata or Hanum<193>n reflect ç
different aspects of that dharma in their life and doings, whereas ç
R<193>va<207>a and his ilk exhibit the tragic consequences of its ç
not being followed.
Let us now deal briefly with these characters of the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a.
@S10 = R°MA
R<193>ma was extremely handsome. R<193>ma was extraordinarily strong. ç
R<193>ma was par excellence, in the use of weapons and missiles, ç
especially in archery which was his forte. Hence the use of the word ç
`r<193>mab<193><207>a' for any unfailing remedy in any field. He was ç
a past-master in the science of war or the art of peace.
He was deeply learned in the scriptural lore. His knowledge of literature ç
or music or logic was astounding. None could beat him in the finesse ç
of conversation or consultation or negotiation.
Yet, he was humble, affectionate and easily approachable. He rejoiced ç
like a father in the happiness of his subjects and felt grieved at ç
their sorrows and sufferings.
Above all, he was deeply devoted to satya, truth. He spoke nothing ç
but truth and, once word was given, he would keep it at all costs.
He loved and served his parents. He was fond of his brothers, his ç
wife and his friends. But, when it came to the protection of satya ç
and dharma, he would exercise his adamantine will and show that no ç
sacrifice was too great to preserve these principles. To protect the ç
truth of the word given by Da·aratha to Kaikey<200> he gave up the ç
kingdom in a trice and that too when he was about to be crowned! To ç
protect the honour of his race and that of the crown and set an example ç
in dharma to his subjects,he subjected S<200>t<193>, his dearest ç
wife, first to the fire- ordeal and then, later, abandoned her even ç
though he knew in his heart of hearts that she was pure and innocent!
Da·aratha, who was a prisoner of his own making, urged R<193>ma to ç
disobey him and even imprison him! Bharata offered back the kingdom ç
to him and earnestly importuned him to return. Even Vasi<218><219>ha, ç
the royal preceptor concurred with Bharata! Notwithstanding all these ç
pressures put on him by these beloved ones, R<193>ma not only refused ç
to budge but also successfully convinced them of the correctness of ç
his decision!
@SPACE1 = 
When he returned to Ayodhy<193> after duly completing the period of ç
banishment, he did not hesitate to take back the kingdom and rule ç
over it. However, he was even prepared to abdicate his right to the ç
kingdom in favour of Bharata, if Bharata had by that time become attached ç
to  it.  This  only  shows  his  extreme nobility and supreme indifference ç
towards mundane comforts.
While living in the forest, he adopted the way of life of the <216><218>is ç
and munis (sages). And yet, as a k<218>attriya warrior and an envoy ç
of the ruler of the land, hedid not forget his duty towards the helpless ç
forest dwellers, especially when they beseeched him to protect them ç
against the depradations of the r<193>k<218>asas (demons). When S<200>t<193> ç
protested that he was misusing his might against the r<193>k<218>asas ç
who had done no harm to him, he unequivocally declared that it was ç
his duty to chastise or even destroy the evil-doers who harmed the ç
law-abiding citizens. He was prepared to abandon even S<200>t<193> ç
and Lak<218>ma<207>a, if need be, in the process, but not his dharma! ç
And this he did, when the need arose.
@SPACE1 = 
In friendship also R<193>ma was absolutely loyal and steady. Sugr<200>va ç
sought his friendship. R<193>ma reciprocated. He killed V<193>li and ç
got Sugr<200>va crowned as the king of Ki<218>kindh<193>, thereby ç
fulfilling his part of the covenant. But, Sugr<200>va on his part ç
faltered. On being pulled up by R<193>ma, he corrected himself and ç
then plunged himself wholeheartedly in the service of R<193>ma.
Now, a few words about the V<193>li episode that has raised a lot ç
of hue and cry in the academic circles, accusing R<193>ma of adharma ç
or unrighteous conduct. It should be remembered that the basic source ç
of the whole story is the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a of V<193>lm<200>ki. ç
In this work V<193>lm<200>ki himself has solved the problem by showing ç
that the very V<193>li who raised the objections first, accepted R<193>ma's ç
answer in toto and asked for forgiveness! Since V<193>lm<200>ki ç
did not create either V<193>li or R<193>ma but has only narrated whatever ç
had happened between them, there is no need for anyone else, much ç
less the persons of our gene-ration, removed as we are from them by ç
a few millennia, to take up the cudgels on V<193>li's behalf and run ç
down R<193>ma! Suffice it to say that V<193>li knew better.
R<193>ma was a great leader who knew the pulse of his followers very ç
well. When Vibh<200><218>a<207>a arrived in his camp and sought refuge, ç
R<193>ma placed the problem before all of them and gave them full ç
freedom to express their views fearlessly. Finally when he did take ç
the decision, it was in perfect accord with his svadharma, of not ç
refusing shelter to anyone who sought it, even if it be R<193>va<207>a ç
himself<|>! We should note that this decision of his was against ç
the overwhelming†almost unanimous† decision of the war council he ç
had called! Apart from his svadharma, he had so much confidence in ç
his own immense might that he was least afraid of even the mightiest ç
of the enemies. Since he was sure of his victory over R<193>va<207>a ç
and the conquest of La<209>k<193>, he then and there got Vibh<200><218>a<207>a ç
crowned as the king of La<209>k<193>, so that La<209>k<193> and its ç
innocent citizens would not suffer after the war.
@SPACE1 = 
In the war with R<193>va<207>a and his army, R<193>ma always followed ç
the path of rectitude even though the enemies often adopted unfair ç
or even foul means and crooked strategies. Though he had to suffer ç
in the process, he never wavered from it! During the very first combat ç
with R<193>va<207>a, R<193>ma had worsted him so much that he could ç
have easily killed him. However, his sense of dharma was so strong ç
that he permitted the enemy to escape from the battlefield with his ç
life and limb intact, but also challenged him to come again after ç
recouping for another round. When R<193>va<207>a was finally killed ç
and when Vibh<200><218>a<207>a refused to perform his last rites, ç
R<193>ma admonished him and declared that he himself would undertake ç
it if he did not! (Compare this with the present day war ethics!)
S<200>t<193> was liberated. R<193>ma was happy. However, having known ç
the psychology of the common masses who could crucify even a saint, ç
he refused to accept her. The huge crowd comprising the v<193>naras ç
and the r<193>k<218>asas was watching with bated breath. S<200>t<193> ç
rose to the occasion. Her whole life was for R<193>ma's sake. If he ç
disowned her, she had no other alternative than death. To immolate ç
herself in fire was her decision. R<193>ma did not object. He knew ç
that her blazing purity would protect her from the fire. The fire ç
that did not burn Hanum<193>n's tail because of her command, how could ç
it consume her at all? As expected, she was restored to R<193>ma ç
unscathed.
This was R<193>ma's master-stroke that publicly proved the greatness ç
of not only himself and his spouse, but also vindicated dharma itself, ç
that it protects those who protect it!
@SPACE1 = 
Once R<193>ma assumed the reigns of the kingdom, he ruled it like ç
a father and a mother rolled into one. Punishing the wicked, protecting ç
the good and affording all opportunities to the subjects to lead avirtuous ç
life was the hall-mark of hisadministration. Since he meticulously ç
followed dharma in his own life, even nature†which is also ruled by ç
<216>ta, the cosmic aspect of dharma†was kind to his country.
However, even in the R<193>mar<193>jya†the country ruled by R<193>ma†there ç
were people whose tongues wagged a little more than R<193>ma's goodness ç
and greatness could withstand. The central figure of this calumny ç
was again the poor S<200>t<193>! To protect the honour of the Ik<218>v<193>ku ç
race and to keep his subjects within the limits of dharma, the dharma ç
of family life, R<193>ma banished S<200>t<193> to the forest where ç
V<193>lm<200>ki gave her shelter. S<200>t<193> knew her lord's compulsions ç
and fully cooperated, never being bitter against him for this unkind ç
act.
@SPACE1 = 
The beheading of <185>amb<220>ka, the s<220>dra ascetic, by R<193>ma ç
has drawn the ire of many a critic of the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a story. ç
A look at all the facts of the story and a dispassionate analysis ç
of the same will reveal that R<193>ma acted in the best interest of ç
the society and in accordance with the dharma of the times.
The ·<220>dras were not prohibited from performing tapas or austerities ç
provided it was for self-purification or self-realization. And, even ç
for this they were expected to follow the injunctions of the ·<193>stras ç
(the scriptures honoured by the society) and ·i<218><219><193>c<193>ra ç
(conduct set up by the tradition of the good in the society). <185>amb<220>ka ç
was performing severe austerities with the intention of ascending ç
to heaven in the human body! This was clearly against the scriptural ç
injunctions and the norms for entry into heaven which required the ç
acquisition of a divine and subtle body to fit in with the heavenly ç
creation. It is obvious that <185>amb<220>ka was very much attached ç
to his physical body and†perhaps, against the wiser counsels of the ç
wise ones of the society†was trying to force his entry as it were, ç
into heaven. That means, the rules of the game had to be relaxed to ç
cater to his whims, thereby disturbing the cosmic balance. It is akin ç
to someone insisting on admission into the intensive care unit or ç
the operation theatre of a hospital with his polluted clothes on, ç
refusing to change over to the sterilized dress! If such a behaviour, ç
that too if it is accompanied by an agitational approach, is condoned, ç
the consequences would be catastrophic. The untimely death of the ç
br<193>hma<207>a boy was only the first stirring of this since the ç
subtle cosmic structure was getting loosened. Hence R<193>ma was right ç
in doing what he did. If we remember R<193>ma's affectionate treatment ç
meted out to Guha and <185>abar<200>, who were also from the ·<220>dra ç
class, we can appreciate his conduct better. And, the revival of the ç
dead boy back to life, confirms the rightness of R<193>ma's conduct.
R<193>ma was the personification of infinite compassion, love and ç
consideration, and gratefulness. That is why when he ascended to his ç
heavenly abode, he granted liberation to all the citizens of Ayodhy<193> ç
who had accompanied him till the end.
@SPACE1 = 
Whether R<193>ma was God become man or man become God, V<193>lm<200>ki's ç
R<193>ma is intensely human. He loves, rejoices, weeps or gets angry ç
or exhibits many other human moods like anyone of us. However, in ç
and through all these, he has shown to what limits we can expand and ç
evolve. That is why he has been called†and rightly so†`Mary<193>d<193> ç
Puru<218>ottama,' the best of men who has expanded the human possibilities ç
to infinite limits (mary<193>d<193><|>=<|>limit, border). The tribute ç
paid by M<193>r<200>ca, a demon and an erstwhile foe of R<193>ma, ç
viz., that he was vigrahav<193>n dharma<199> (Personified Dharma), ç
speaks volumes for R<193>ma's greatness. 
@S10 = LAK<186>MAØA
If there is anyone in the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a who lived for R<193>ma ç
and for nothing else or none else, it is Lak<218>ma<207>a. He was ç
a paragon of loving service to R<193>ma. He was deeply attached to ç
R<193>ma right from the childhood days. R<193>ma too was equally attached ç
to him.
Was Lak<218>ma<207>a irascible? Was he an agnostic who cared a fig ç
for dharma? Was he a disobedient and heartless son who despised his ç
own father? Was he suspicious by nature? What were his achievements ç
in life? Almost nothing?
This description, this list of `vices,' may appear to fit in well ç
with Lak<218>ma<207>a as long as one does not understand the intensity ç
or the depth of his love for R<193>ma. The one and only puru<218><193>rtha ç
or purpose of his life was to keep R<193>ma happy. Keeping that end ç
in view, he was ever prepared for any service, any sacrifice, in his ç
life.
No one asked him to accompany R<193>ma to the forest. But he was ready ç
even before R<193>ma was! He walked in front clearing the path. He ç
built the huts for the comfortable living of R<193>ma and S<200>t<193>. ç
He gathered the articles of food for them, cooked for them, served ç
them and stood guard when they slept or rested. The hut he built at ç
Pa<210>cava<219><200> pleased R<193>ma so immensely that he saw in ç
Lak<218>ma<207>a his own father's love.
When Bharata came to the Citrak<220><219>a with his huge army and ç
retinue Lak<218>ma<207>a flew into a rage suspecting harm from him ç
for R<193>ma. When he learnt of his noble intentions he was ashamed ç
and melted in love.
R<193>ma  had  hesitated  to  kill  the demoness T<193><219>ak<193> ç
since she was a woman and since killing a woman was considered to ç
be a grave sin. But Lak<218>ma<207>a did not waver in the least to ç
punish <185><220>rpa<207>akh<193> since R<193>ma had commanded him ç
to do so. His duty was just to implement R<193>ma's orders!
Lak<218>ma<207>a was very intelligent and thoughtful. He could easily ç
see through the m<193>y<193> or the deceptions of the r<193>k<218>asas ç
behind the golden deer. He warned both S<200>t<193> and R<193>ma about ç
it. Unfortunately hedid not succeed in preventing what actually happened.
When S<200>t<193> castigated him and threatened to commit suicide ç
if he did not go to the rescue of R<193>ma (after the deer had been ç
killed), he left with a heavy heart thinking that disobeying R<193>ma's ç
command was better than allowing the self-immolation of S<200>t<193>. ç
Yet, he could not escape the censure by R<193>ma!
When R<193>ma was inconsolable due to the loss of S<200>t<193>, it ç
was Lak<218>ma<207>a who stood by him like a rock, often giving the ç
healing touch by his mature advice and timely consolation.
In the war with the r<193>k<218>asas, Lak<218>ma<207>a fought bitterly ç
not caring for his own life. His conquest of Indrajit was considered ç
by the sages of the day, even more difficult of accomplishment than ç
that of R<193>va<207>a by R<193>ma.
@SPACE1 = 
His feelings, when he had to prepare the pyre for S<200>t<193>†during ç
the fire ordeal† and be a mute witness to it, can better be imagined ç
than described.
When R<193>ma returned to Ayodhy<193> and was coronated as the king, ç
he offered Lak<218>ma<207>a the position of yuvar<193>ja (heir apparent) ç
which he flatly refused to accept since it would interfere with his ç
service to R<193>ma!
At the time of banishment of S<200>t<193> it was again the poor Lak<218>ma<207>a ç
that had to carry it out. It was worse than hell for him.
Just as R<193>ma was closeted with the K<193>lapuru<218>a and Lak<218>ma<207>a ç
was guarding the place with strict instructions not to allow anybody ç
inside, Durv<193>sas, the sage known for his volcanic temper, appeared ç
on the scene and insisted upon being admitted into the presence of ç
R<193>ma. Lak<218>ma<207>a had only two alternatives before him: To ç
admit him and face death as punishment at the hands of R<193>ma, or ç
prevent him, thereby subjecting all to destruction by the wrath of ç
the sage's curse. Lak<218>ma<207>a made the supreme sacri-fice by ç
choosing the former alternative since he did not want the entire Ayodhy<193> ç
to be annihilated.
As soon as R<193>ma expelled him as a substitute for punishment with ç
death, Lak<218>ma<207>a went straight to the Saray<220> river and ç
gave up the body since there was no use living any more without his ç
R<193>ma!
@S10 = BHARATA
Though Bharata was only next to R<193>ma in age, he conducted himself ç
as the least of the brothers. If R<193>ma accepted the loss of the ç
kingdom and expulsion to the forest stoically, Bharata gave up the ç
kingdom that was placed in his lap as his, since he could never accept ç
the injustice done to R<193>ma. After severely reproaching his mother ç
Kaikey<200> for all the havoc that had been wrought by her, he tried ç
his best to bring back R<193>ma and coronate him as the king. When ç
he didnot succeed, he consented to rule as R<193>ma's regent by installing ç
his sandals on the throne and himself living in a village like a hermit, ç
denying all the pleasures of life that had been denied to R<193>ma.
Bharata had ruled the kingdom so efficiently that its properties and ç
resources had been multiplied ten times. When R<193>ma returned, Bharata ç
offered the kingdom back to him immediately and felt greatly relieved. ç
R<193>ma made him the yuvar<193>ja. An ideal brother and an ideal ç
devotee of R<193>ma, Bharata continues to live in the hearts of Indians ç
for ever.
@S10 = DA<185>ARATHA
The picture of Da·aratha that we get while reading the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
is that of an old man, a weak king, a lustful prisoner of Kaikey<200>'s ç
beauty and a father doting on his son R<193>ma.
However, in his younger days, he had proved to be a great warrior, ç
capable of driving his ratha or chariot in da·a or ten directions†hence ç
the name Da·aratha †and an able as well as popular ruler.
His greatest defect was his impulsive nature, of giving promises without ç
discretion or discrimination. It was this that made  him  promise  A·vapati  Kekaya, ç
father of Kaikey<200>, that her son would be crowned as the king. ç
Again it was the same trait that made him promise Vi·v<193>mitra to ç
give whatever he wanted and then try to back out when he wanted R<193>ma ç
to be sent with him. It was again the same story that repeated with ç
Kaikey<200>, leading to untold misery and even his own death under ç
tragic circumstances.
@S10 = SUGR®VA*
On returning to Ayodhy<193> after the exile, R<193>ma introduced Sugr<200>va ç
to Bharata as their fifth brother. He fully deserved that remark and ç
status by his surrender to R<193>ma and dedication to his cause. However, ç
it took quite some time for him to rise to that level.
Though Sugr<200>va was himself a strong man and a great warrior, the ç
repeated defeats and hammerings he had received at the hands of the ç
powerful but vicious V<193>li had made him extremely suspicious, nervous ç
and cowardly. That is why he suspected R<193>ma and Lak<218>ma<207>a ç
at first sight as V<193>li's spies. He gained full faith in R<193>ma's ç
prowess only after testing him in more than one way.
He was intelligent, shrewd and worldly-wise. He was also addicted ç
to the lower pleasures of life like sex and drinking. However, by ç
the deft handling of R<193>ma he came round quickly and proved to ç
be a great asset.
After being crowned as the king of Ki<218>kindh<193>, Sugr<200>va ç
made arrangements to gather all the v<193>nara warriors from different ç
places at Ki<218>kindh<193> to help R<193>ma in his search for S<200>t<193>. ç
He then retired into his harem and forgot all about hisresponsibility ç
as the king and his dutytowards R<193>ma. When R<193>ma sent Lak<218>ma<207>a ç
as his envoy to caution him and even warn him, Sugr<200>va pacified ç
the irate Lak<218>ma<207>a through T<193>r<193>. Then he plunged into ç
his task earnestly.
Once the whereabouts of S<200>t<193> were known, Sugr<200>va mobilised ç
his forces andmarched towards La<209>k<193> under the leadership ç
of R<193>ma. The help he rendered to R<193>ma both personally and ç
through his army of monkeys was invaluable. He even fought a duel ç
with R<193>va<207>a on seeing him for the first time and returned ç
after inflicting humiliation upon him. This being an impulsive and ç
rash act, he was pulled up by R<193>ma. 
R<193>va<207>a tried to entice Sugr<200>va away from R<193>ma but ç
got a severe rebuff. His loyalty to R<193>ma was, by now, absolutely ç
firm.
He fought bravely and killed many a r<193>k<218>asa warrior. His eagerness ç
to witness R<193>ma's coronation made R<193>ma bring him and all the ç
v<193>nara heroes to Ayodhy<193>. He was honoured suitably.
When R<193>ma decided to leave for his heavenly abode, Sugr<200>va ç
also accompanied him.
@S10 = HANUM°N
Hanum<193>n can be considered as the brightest jewel, a veritable ç
diamond, in the necklace of R<193>m<193>ya<207>a characters. His ç
physical strength and prowess were proverbial. His mastery over the ç
scriptures was unmatched. His speech was not only faultless but also ç
elegant. His intelligence and shrewdness were, by any standards, extraordinary. ç
His common sense was uncanny. Even his facial appearance, though belonging ç
to the race of the v<193>naras, was bright and pleasant. Above all, ç
his devotion to R<193>ma was supreme, towering far above all other ç
qualities. Anyone, as R<193>ma himself admits, who has such an one ç
as his servant or envoy or minister, should deem himself as the luckiest ç
of beings and there is no task that he cannot accomplish.
Hanum<193>n was the son of A<210>jan<193>dev<200>, born as a result ç
of the grace of V<193>yudeva (the god of wind, also known as Marut). ç
Hence the appellations °<210>janeya and M<193>ruti. The blow delivered ç
by Indra, by his Vajr<193>yudha, on his jaw (=<|>hanu) when he was ç
a baby, to check his menacing prowess, left it swollen and hence he ç
came to be known as `Hanum<193>n,' `one with a prominent jaw'. He ç
was educated by no less a person than S<220>rya, the Sun-god and  acquired  immunity  from  various ç
weapons, as per the boons of the gods in heaven. Once as a child, ç
he incurred the wrath of some sages by his michievous pranks that ç
were too much to bear. They cursed him that he would not remember ç
his strength until someone reminded him about it. This silenced him, ç
preventing him from harassing the hapless sages.
When Sugr<200>va was driven out by V<193>li from Ki<218>kindh<193>, ç
Hanum<193>n chose to leave the country along with him, even though ç
V<193>li begged him to stay on, since he knew that dharma was on Sugr<200>va's ç
side. He voluntarily underwent all the hardships for Sugr<200>va's ç
sake.
@SPACE1 = 
When R<193>ma and Lak<218>ma<207>a arrived at the foot of the hill ç
<184><218>yam<220>ka, Sugr<200>va deputed him to find out who they ç
were. His manner of approach†reverent and courteous†as well as his ç
refined speech impressed R<193>ma so much that he gave vent to his ç
admiration. Convinced of their nobility and greatness Hanum<193>n ç
carried them to Sugr<200>va and eulogised them before him. The attraction ç
of Hanum<193>n for R<193>ma and R<193>ma's special affection for him ç
that sprouted on that first meeting grew to phenomenal proportions ç
and have now become a legend.
When V<193>li was killed by R<193>ma, and T<193>r<193>, his queen, ç
was inconsolable with grief, it was Hanum<193>n who succeeded in restoring ç
her mental balance and peace by timely advice with an effective philosophical ç
discourse.
Again, when Sugr<200>va had steeped himself in sensuous pleasures ç
neglecting his duties of the State, it was Hanum<193>n who roused ç
him out of that stupor and advised him to apologise to R<193>ma through ç
Lak<218>ma<207>a.
When Sugr<200>va sent four batches of his troops in the four cardinal ç
directions in search of S<200>t<193>, he sent Hanum<193>n as a leader ç
of the southern batch, since the possibility of finding S<200>t<193> ç
in the south were the brightest.
R<193>ma too gave his signet ring to Hanum<193>n with the necessary ç
instructions of what to communicate to S<200>t<193> when found. This ç
clearly shows the faith that they reposed in him.
@SPACE1 = 
After reaching the southern shore ofthe land mass, the v<193>naras ç
became despondent. A<209>gada, their leader, even spoke of staying ç
back permanently! Hanum<193>n effectively intervened and through his ç
wise counsels successfully prevented what might have resulted in a ç
division of the country of Ki<218>kindh<193>. This shows his farsightedness ç
and loyalty to the cause he had committed himself.
Hanum<193>n crossed the vast ocean with a mighty leap, overcoming ç
all the obstacles on the way. He entered the city of La<209>k<193> ç
after vanquishing the demoness La<209>k<193> the protectress of the ç
fort-city. He searched for S<200>t<193> in every nook and corner, ç
especially in R<193>va<207>a's palace and the harem but was disappointed. ç
That the seeing of the women of the harem in various uncouth postures ç
did not upset his steady mind in any way is a tribute to his brahmacarya ç
or celibate life. Realizing that such a pativrat<193> (a chaste lady ç
deeply devoted only to her husband) like S<200>t<193> could never ç
consent to be in the palace of an abductor, he started searching for ç
her elsewhere. Finally he found her in the A·oka grove, the pleasure ç
garden of R<193>va<207>a behind his palace.
Hanum<193>n had to use all his wisdom and tact to establish contact ç
with her and to develop a personal rapport. Once that was done, the ç
rest was easy. He gave her R<193>ma's signet ring and message, and, ç
reassured her of R<193>ma rescuing her very soon. He took the c<220><195><193>ma<207>i ç
(crestjewel) from her to be delivered to R<193>ma as also her message.
@SPACE1 = 
Hanum<193>n, though his task was fulfilled, did not want to leave, ç
without leaving a mark, a warning shot as it were, to the enemy. So ç
he contrived to meet R<193>va<207>a and also have a surveillant view ç
of his city by destroying his favourite pleasure garden and killing ç
all the r<193>k<218>asa warriors that came to capture him. Later, ç
wilfully submitting himself to Indrajit's Brahm<193>stra,  he  succeeded  in  meeting
