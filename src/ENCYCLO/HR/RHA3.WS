@SB = Epilogue
Within a short span of 117 years (<MS>A.D.<D> 1886-2003), the Ramakrishna ç
Movement has grown into a formidable force influencing the lives of ç
millions of persons interested in personal peace of mind and social ç
harmony.
Absence of narrow, sectarian or fana-tical approach to religion, an ç
all-comprehensive view of life stressing spiritual evolution of man ç
rather than the dogmatic side  of  religious  observances,  and  a ç
genuine attitude of service to man as service to God have endeared ç
this Movement to one and all.
If the decent and dignified behaviour of the well-educated and cultured ç
monastics of the Order has given the organisation its good image, ç
no less is the contribution of the volunteers, the devotees and the ç
well-wishers to its phenomenal growth.
No wonder then, that it has been widely recognised as having added ç
a new dimension to Hindu monasticism and played a significant role ç
in the renaissance of Hinduism.

@SPACE1 = 
The ordinary men of this world, sometimes, become so ordinary that ç
extra- ordinary men have to appear here to lift them up to no ordinary ç
heights, if not extraordinary ones. These tall men who walk this earth, ç
may seem to be no different from others at first, but soon grow to ç
superhuman proportions revealing their true nature even as Vi<218><207>u ç
(the all- pervading Divinity) appeared first asV<193>mana (the dwarf) ç
and then as Trivikrama (one who occupied all the threeworlds).
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a<|>†<|>also known as `<185>r<200> R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
Paramaha<221>sa' or just `Paramaha<221>sa'†belongs to this rare species. ç
His life was religion†in the highest sense†in practice. He lifted ç
up religion from the morass of rituals and dogmas to great mystical ç
heights as effortlessly as Var<193>ha (the Boar-incarnation of Vi<218><207>u) ç
the earth. An earnest study of his life†his doings and sayings†can ç
not only inspire us but also elevate us to transcendental levels.

@SB = 2.	The Exodus
@SPACE1 = 
It was a misty morning in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1814. The place was the small ç
village called Derepur in Bengal. Khudir<193>m Ca<219><219>op<193>-dhy<193>ya, ç
the highly venerated br<193>hma<207>a of the village, was about to ç
depart from there, for good, along with his wife Candr<193>- dev<200> ç
and the two children, R<193>mkum<193>r and R<193>me·var, for another ç
village, K<193>m<193>r-puk<220>r (112 kms. or 70 miles to the north- ç
west of Calcutta [now Kolkata], the metro-polis of Bengal). Since ç
he had dared to disobey the zamindar (land-lord) of the village by ç
refusing to bear false witness, he had incurred his wrath and had ç
been banished.
Khudir<193>m left nonchalantly, loudly chanting `Jay Raghuv<200>r!' ç
(`Victory to Lord R<193>ma!'), leaving behind the simple village-folk ç
sorrow-stricken.
As soon as he arrived at K<193>m<193>rpuk<220>r, he was received by ç
his old friend and other villagers, with great warmth, love and affection. ç
They quickly provided the whole family all that they needed, for a ç
simple but comfortable life.
It was this Khudir<193>m who had sacrificed everything for the sake ç
of truth, that was chosen by Destiny to be the father of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, ç
who declared in his later life that truth is the sine qua nonof ç
religion, even in this Kaliyuga or IronAge.
@SB = 3.	The Visions
Khudir<193>m was fond of pilgrimage. In <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1824 he had ç
gone to R<193>me·varam all alone by foot, walking more than 2400 kms. ç
(1500 miles). However, it was during his visit to the Vi<218><207>u ç
(known as Gad<193>dhara) temple at Gay<193> (in Bih<193>r) in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1835 that he had a wonderful vision of the Lord informing him of his ç
decision to incarnate in his house as his son! Almost at the same ç
time, Candr<193>dev<200>, while paying her homage to Lord <185>iva ç
in the temple near her house, had another experience, that of a divine ç
light from the icon in the temple entering into her andmaking her ç
unconscious. When she regained her consciousness she felt as if she ç
was with child.
When Khudir<193>m returned home and learnt of her strange experience, ç
his own conviction about the visitation of the Divine got further ç
confirmed.
The couple started eagerly preparing for the auspicious arrival of ç
the Divine Being in their womb through prayers and austerities.
By the by, these two experiences of the holy couple affirm the statements ç
in the Hindu scriptures that Vi<218><207>u and <185>iva are two aspects ç
of the same Supreme Being.
@SB = 4.	Nativity and Early Life
The advent of the divine child took place on the 18th February 1836 ç
at about 5:15<MS> A.M.<D>
He was named `Gad<193>dhar' since he was born as the earthly manifestation ç
of the deity Gad<193>dhara-Vi<218><207>u of Gay<193>.
The infant Gad<193>dhar proved his divinity in various ways by vouchsafing ç
mysterious experiences to the members of the household, especially ç
to his mother Candr<193>dev<200>.
As he grew up into an extremely charming and highly talented boy, ç
he became the darling of the whole village. Apart from being healthy ç
and handsome, his extraordinary skills in fine-arts, music and acting ç
made him the cynosure of all eyes.
As for formal education at the village school, he evinced little interest ç
and specially abhorred mathematics.
Even as a young boy, Gad<193>dhar could get into moods of religious ç
ecstasy as naturally as a bird takes to flying. The first experience ç
of ecstasy came to him as he was walking on the ridge of a paddy field, ç
observing the flight of white cranes against the background of black ç
clouds of the rainy season. The second experience occurred when he ç
was visiting the shrine of the village goddess Vi·<193>l<193>k<218><200> ç
of the nearby °n<220>r, in the company of elderly women-devotees. ç
The third happened when he was dressed as <185>iva on a <185>ivar<193>tri ç
day and brought to the stage for a whole-night drama.
@SPACE1 = 
It was sometime during this period that Khudir<193>m passed away and ç
the young Gad<193>dhar experienced the first bereavement of his life. ç
This shock made him realise the transient nature of life here and ç
slowly heralded the dawn of spiritual quest, the quest for the Eternal. ç
The approaching upanayana ceremony (the ceremony of investiture with ç
the sacred thread, an insignia of br<193>hma<207>ahood) provided him ç
with an excellent opportunity for starting on this quest.
The pure in heart shall see God. Even if they cannot do so immediately, ç
they can at least intuit the divine presence. This is exactly what ç
Dhan<200>, the servant-maid and <185>r<200>niv<193>s, the bangle-seller ç
did. Both of them had instinctively felt Gad<193>dhar's immanent divinity.
Dhan<200> had taken a promise from Gad<193>dhar that he would accept ç
the first alms form her hands during his upanayana ceremony.
This he did, in spite of vehement opposition from the orthodox brothers; ç
because, for him, truth and keeping up one's word were the most essential ç
part of religion.
<185>r<200>niv<193>s too had his cup of ambrosia filled up, when one ç
day, he seized the opportunity of ritualistic worship to Gad<193>dhar ç
privately, shedding tears of joy all the while.
@SB = 5.	From the Pond to the Ocean
After the death of his father Khudi-r<193>m, R<193>mkum<193>r, the ç
eldest brother of Gad<193>dhar, migrated to Calcutta and opened a ç
<219>ol (a p<193><219>ha·<193>l<193>, a school of Sanskrit and traditional ç
learning) there, to better his worldly prospects.
When he visited K<193>m<193>rpuk<220>r once (in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1852) ç
he discovered to his dismay that Gad<193>dhar (now a youth of 16) ç
was completely neglecting his studies and spending much of his time ç
in worship and other spiritual pursuits. So, he decided to take him ç
away to Calcutta, not only to educate him but also to get assistance ç
from him in his own profession.
Gad<193>dhar was really sorry to leave his dear village and its simple ç
folk. He must have, at first, felt lost like a small fish shifted ç
from a little pond to a limitless ocean. However, he being like the ç
fish of the Matsy<193>vat<193>ra (the Fish-incarnation of Lord Vi<218><207>u) ç
that gradually grew to mighty proportions, needed this change for ç
the good of the world.
R<193>mkum<193>r, at first, handed over the responsibility to Gad<193>dhar, ç
of conducting ritualistic worship in some houses, which he himself ç
was doing, so as to pay greater attention to his school. Though Gad<193>dhar ç
did this work most willingly and enthusiastically, earning theencomiums ç
of the enchanted householders, he continued to remain as indifferent ç
and impervious as before, towards formal secular education.
@SB = 6.	The Encounter
Being the chief-guardian responsible for his future life, R<193>mkum<193>r ç
could no longer ignore this. Hence he called Gad<193>dhar one day ç
and admonished him for this negligence of formal education.
@SPACE1 = 
Gad<193>dhar  was  neither  dull  nor immature.  His  uncanny  intellect  and ç
mature mind had revealed to him how the whole world was immersed in ç
`k<193>min<200>-k<193><210>cana' (lust and greed), a term which he ç
often used in his later life as a world-teacher, and not in the least ç
in God, the final (and the real) goal of life. So, he had no other ç
go than politely but firmly refusing to fall in line, by declaring ç
that he was least interested in bread-winning education.
Himself being a spiritually inclined and refined person, R<193>mkum<193>r ç
could understand the aspirations of his younger brother and hence ç
gave him full freedom to chart out his own course of life.
Thus ended the encounter, the first and the last, in their lives.
@SPACE = 
@SB = 7.	The Stage Divine
@SPACE = 
When R<193><207><200> R<193>sma<207>i (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1793-1861) the ç
intrepid land-lady of J<193>nbaz<193>r in Calcutta decided to go on ç
a pilgrimage to K<193>·<200> (V<193>r<193><207>as<200>, the famous ç
pilgrimage centre in Uttar Pradesh) she was commanded by K<193>l<200>, ç
the Divine Mother, in a dream, to cancel the pilgrimage and build ç
a temple complex for her at the place (called Dak<218>i<207>e·var ç
now), also indicated by her in the same dream.
The R<193><207><200> lost no time in fulfilling the wishes of the ç
Divine Mother. However, when the temple-complex was fully ready,no ç
br<193>hma<207>a priest was prepared to undertake the responsibility ç
of ceremonially consecrating it since it had been built by a ·<220>dra ç
woman, thereby proving that man can dispose even when God proposes!
However, God, the final disposing authority, would not take it lying ç
down. Strange as it may seem, it came to the lot of R<193>mkum<193>r ç
himself (Remember his bitter opposition to Gad<193>dhar's accepting ç
the first alms from Dhan<200>, the ·<220>dra woman!) not only to suggest ç
a way out, but also do the consecration ceremony, as well as the regular ç
daily worship in that very temple!
@SPACE = 
@SB = 8.	Th<%10>e<%0><|>Turbulenc<%10>e<%0><|>an<%10>d<%0><|>th<%10>e<%0><|>Tranquillity
@SPACE = 
Hardly a year after the consecration of the temple complex, death ç
suddenly snatched away R<193>mkum<193>r. Though stunned by this sudden ç
development the R<193><207><200>, along with her highly competent ç
son-in-law, Mathur<193>n<193>th Bi·v<193>s (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1817-1871), ç
managed to prevail upon Gad<193>dhar, by now known as R<193>mak<216><218><207>a*, ç
to take up the worship of the Mother K<193>l<200>. He reluctantly ç
agreed on the condition that H<216>day†his nephew who had come there ç
seeking a job in the temple complex †be entrusted with the responsibility ç
of taking care of the ornaments and other valuables. This was of course ç
immediately conceded.
Though R<193>mak<216><218><207>a started worshipping the Mother K<193>l<200> ç
in the temple in the usual way, observing all the rituals and formalities, ç
very soon a strange but intense desire gripped his heart to know whether ç
the Divine Mother was actually living in that image or whether it ç
was a lifeless statue of stone. This made him undertake severe†even ç
superhuman†austerities for quite a few months. Unable to bear the ç
poor response from the Mother of the Universe, he tried to end his ç
life with the very sword of K<193>l<200> kept in the temple. This ç
resulted in an instant revelation of cosmic consciousness, first as ç
the living presence of Mother K<193>l<200> and then as an ocean of ç
bliss, whose surging waves knocked out of him all awareness of the ç
external world. When he came back into his own, he was a totally transformed ç
person,  able  to  perceive  clearly  the presence of the Divine everywhere ç
and in everything. As he was gliding from the superconscious to the ç
conscious level, the Divine Mother commanded him to be in the bh<193>vamukha ç
state. Hereafter, the image was no more an image of stone but the ç
intensely living Divine Mother Herself.
The word bh<193>vamukha, generally translated as the `threshold ç
of consciousness' is a special technical term used by R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
and needs some explanation since it is not found in the earlier religious ç
works.
A person standing on the thresholdof the main doorway of a house ç
is absolutely free to move in or move out at will. Even so, a person ç
who has reached the summit of spiritual experience, attaining identity ç
with the Absolute (or Brahman), can come down to the plane of relative ç
consciousness, of names and forms, and even engage himself in activities ç
that are motivated by infinite compassion, for the good of mankind. ç
Any moment, at will, he can also effortlessly raise his mind to the ç
level of the Absolute, totally oblivious of the world. Even when he ç
is in the relative plane, he continues to be in touch with the Absolute ç
too, since, for him, it is always one state and not two, as we may ç
surmise.
@SPACE1 = 
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a calls such a person as a `vij<210><193>ni'.
@SB = 9.	Bind Unbound
If strange are the ways of God, stranger still are the ways of the ç
God- intoxicated men. Utterly unable to understand R<193>mak<216><218><207>a's ç
state of mind, people started believing that he was out of his mind. ç
The news soon got wind and reached the ears of Candr<193>dev<200> ç
and Rame·var at K<193>m<193>rpuk<220>r. At their earnest entreaties, ç
he returned to K<193>m<193>rpuk<220>r. To everyone's surprise R<193>mak<216><218><207>a's ç
behaviour was completely normal! However, not being prepared to take ç
any chances, Candr<193>dev<200> and R<193>me·var secretly started ç
searching for a suitable bride, to get him married, thinking that ç
that would `cure' him of all his `madness!'
@EMERGENCY = When even their desperate search proved futile, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
himself came to their rescue, asking them to contact R<193>mcandra ç
Mukhyop<193>dhy<193>ya of Jayar<193>m-b<193><219>i (a village very ç
near K<193>m<193>rpuk<220>r) in whose house was a girl `specially ç
reserved' for him! In spite of the apparent barrier† since S<193>rad<193> ç
Dev<200>, the girl, was hardly six years old whereas R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
was twentythree†the marriage was performed, as all other things like ç
the matching of the horoscopes, were perfectly in order.
Just after the marriage, when the women of the village were ceremonially ç
circumambulating the couple with lighted torches, the yellow thread ç
tied on the arm of the bridegroom, signifying the matrimonial ties, ç
accidentally caught fire and was reduced to ashes, without scalding ç
him in any way! This mysterious occurrence was actually symbolic of ç
the worldly attachments and attractions associated with the married ç
life, being destroyed even before its beginning.
Thus, the bind was unbound even before it started binding!
Soon after, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a returned toDak<218>i<207>e·var, ç
leaving S<193>rad<193> at her father's house.
@SB = 10.	Expeditions Inward
Though Lord K<216><218><207>a did not need to perform any action to ç
get something pleasant or get rid of something unpleasant†having transcended ç
all duties†yet, he continuously engaged himself in action, to set ç
an example to mankind (vide Bhagavadg<200>t<193> 3.22). Similarly, ç
though R<193>mak<216><218><207>a had realised the highest Truth through ç
his own efforts, without the assistance of any guru (spiritual teacher), ç
lest the ordinary run of mankind also try to do the same and get into ç
trouble, he now started practising s<193>dhan<193>s or spiritual disciplines ç
under the guidance of competent gurus. Thereby, he lent his weight ç
to the age-old tradition of the formal training of a disciple under ç
a qualified teacher. However, instead of the disciple seeking for ç
the teacher, the teachers themselves came to him by the command of ç
the Divine Mother.
The first to arrive was a sa<221>ny<193>sin<200> (nun), Yoge·var<200> ç
by name, but more well-known as Bhairav<200> Br<193>hma<207><200>. ç
Not only did she recognise R<193>mak<216><218><207>a as the third ç
disciple she had been commanded in a vision to guide, but also cured ç
him quickly of his strange malady of a burning sensation all over ç
the body, using a simple recipe. Under her expert guidance, R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a ç
successfully practised even the mostdifficult disciplines prescribed ç
in the tantras (scriptural works extolling the Divine Mother and her ç
worship).
Bhairav<200> Br<193>hma<207><200> was the firstto recognise and to ç
declare that R<193>mak<216><218><207>a was an avat<193>ra or incarnation ç
of God, even as <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a Caitanya was. The gathering ç
of the great contemporary pa<207><195>its including Vai<218><207>avacara<207>, ç
the best of them, that had been assembled by Mathur<193>n<193>th at ç
her behest, conceded it. This was practically the first such recognition ç
which was later confirmed by others such as Gaur<200> Pa<207><195>it, ç
Padmalocan andN<193>r<193>ya<207>a·<193>str<200>, themselves erudite ç
scholars and genuine s<193>dhakas.
As the mood of devotion inculcated by the t<193>ntrik practices persisted, ç
there arrived at Dak<218>i<207>e·var, a Vai<218><207>ava ascetic, ç
Ja<219><193>dh<193>r<200> by name, carrying the image of R<193>ml<193>la ç
or child R<193>ma. To him R<193>ml<193>la was ever a living presence. ç
Very soon, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a discovered the secret and befriended ç
Ja<219><193>dh<193>ri whereas R<193>ml<193>la himself  befriended  R<193>mak<216><218><207>a!  After ç
enjoying filial love towards R<193>ml<193>la for quite some time R<193>mak<216><218><207>a's ç
heart was satiated with v<193>tsalyabh<193>va, an important aspect ç
of the practice of devotion. Ja<219><193>dh<193>ri, on his part, started ç
feeling the presence of Lord R<193>ma within his own heart and hence ç
left the image with R<193>mak<216><218><207>a at the time of his departure.
@SPACE1 = 
Shortly after this R<193>mak<216><218><207>a practised madhurabh<193>va ç
(bridal mysticism), imitating the love of the gop<200>s of V<216>nd<193>ban ç
towards K<216><218><207>a, which culminated in a vision of R<193>dh<193> ç
(the best of the gop<200>s and dearest to K<216><218><207>a) who entered ç
into his body and disappeared.
The last to arrive was Tot<193>pur<200>, thenaked N<193>g<193>sa<221>ny<193>sin, ç
of a hefty buildand an uncompromising attitude ofAdvaita Ved<193>nta. ç
When he saw R<193>mak<216><218><207>a and recognised him as a candidate ç
of the highest order eminently fit for sa<221>ny<193>sa and hence ç
for advaitic practices, he proposed the same.
@SPACE1 = 
After getting the approval of the Divine Mother, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
underwent the ceremonies of sa<221>ny<193>sa and advaita s<193>dhan<193>. ç
He was able to raise his mind instantly to the state of the highest ç
nirvikalpasam<193>dhi in which he remained continuously for three ç
days. Tot<193>pur<200> was astounded at this feat of his disciple ç
since he himself had taken forty long years to attain it!
Though Tot<193>pur<200> had attained a very high state of unitive ç
consciousness, he never believed in, even disdained, God with names ç
and forms. According to R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, the two were the ç
obverse and the reverse of the same Truth, like water and ice.
This lacuna, Tot<193>pur<200> was able to discover and dispel, through ç
a bitter physical ailment deliberately brought about by the Divine ç
Mother of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a. He  departed  from  Dak<218>i<207>e·var  as  a ç
thoroughly chastened and changed person.
After completing all the major modes of s<193>dhan<193>s or spiritual ç
practices in Hinduism, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a turned his attention ç
towards the practice of Islam under the guidance of a Sufi saint. ç
A vision of the Prophet, and later, of Jesus, both of them entering ç
into him and disappearing, gave him the same mystical experience that ç
he had had earlier.
He was thus convinced that the spiritual disciplines prescribed by ç
the various religions of the world, ultimately lead to the same beatific ç
experience, even as all the radii from the various points on the ç
circumference of a circle lead to the same centre.
The equality of all religions taught by him should be understood in ç
this sense, that they all lead to the same experience of beatitude, ç
if practised seriously and sincerely.
After duly completing the expeditions into his inner Self, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
went on an external expedition, to various places of pilgrimage, to ç
oblige his host Mathur-n<193>th Bi·v<193>s, and, perhaps, to sanctify ç
those places, as the N<193>rada Bhaktis<220>tras (69) avers.
@SB = 11.	Consort Deified
While R<193>mak<216><218><207>a was sailing over the unchartered and ç
chartered oceans of religious mysticism, totally oblivious of hiswedded ç
wife S<193>rad<193>dev<200>, she at Jayr<193>mb<193><219><200>, was ç
continuously thinking, when the call would come from him to join him ç
at Dak<218>i<207>e·var.
When people carried tales to her parents that R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
had gone stark mad, she decided to go to him, to be by his side in ç
that hour of crisis and to serve him to the best of her ability.
When she arrived there, she was pleasantly surprised and extremely ç
happy to see him, not only perfectly normal, but also solicitous about ç
her welfare.
Since neither of them was interested in worldly life, but, only, in ç
spiritual companionship,  life  was  smooth.  She became his first ç
disciple and started practising s<193>dhanas under his guidance.
Soon after her arrival, one day R<193>mak<216><218><207>a literally ç
worshipped her as Mother K<193>l<200> Herself and offered all the ç
fruits of his spiritual endeavours at her feet. It was on the Phalah<193>ri<207><200> ç
K<193>l<200>p<220>j<193> day in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1872.
This unique event in the spiritual history of whole mankind signifies ç
two things: total eradication of lust as the end-result; and, that ç
the filial attitude towards all women is the best means of achieving ç
it.
By this wondrous act, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a made her the co-sharer ç
of all his spiritual attainments which automatically became hers too. ç
Also, by invoking the Divine Mother into her and worshipping her, ç
he roused the power of universal motherhood in her. Her later life ç
is a proof of this.
Thus ended the period in R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a's life, of all ç
s<193>dhanas. He was now fully ready to transmit his spiritual wisdom ç
and power to worthy disciples.
@SB = 12.	The Lotus Blooms
A fully bloomed lotus does not have to invite the bees! They are irresistibly ç
drawn towards it and hence swarm it. So is the case of truly illumined ç
souls, especially if they are living in the society.
The news of a Paramaha<221>sa (the `Great Swan', a godman of the highest ç
order) living in the temple campus of Dak<218>i<207>e·var, a suburb ç
of Calcutta, spread gradually, first by word of mouth of those who ç
had met him and later by the writings of Ke·abcandra Sen (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1838-1884) a pre-eminent leader of the Brahma Sam<193>j which was ç
a vibrant reform movement of those days, who was immensely influenced ç
by him. His writings particularly attracted the youth of Bengal.
Thus started a regular procession of devotees, seekers and admirers, ç
many of whom later became his disciples.
Narendra and R<193>kh<193>l, who later on embraced sa<221>ny<193>sa ç
(monastic life) and established the R<193>mak<216><218><207>a Order, ç
formed the core-group of the younger devotees. Balar<193>m Bose (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1842-1890), Gir<200>·- candra Ghosh (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1844-1912), Mahendra- ç
n<193>tha Gupta (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1854-1932)†the famous author of that ç
immortal work The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna†R<193>macandra Datta ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1851-1899) and Surendran<193>th Mitra (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1850-1890) were the most important among the householder disciples.
Durg<193>cara<207> N<193>g (<MS>A.D. <D>1846-1899) more well-known ç
as `N<193>gmah<193>·ay' was another unique personality who combined ç
in himself the highest ideals of both the householder's and the sa<221>ny<193>sin's ç
lives, that came under the influence of this great teacher.
Among these it was given to Gir<200>·-candra Ghosh, a rake who had ç
been resurrected from his miserable state, into a devotee of fiery ç
faith by R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, toboldly and openly proclaim ç
that R<193>mak<216><218><207>a was God Himself whose greatness could ç
not be fathomed even by the great sages like V<193>lm<200>ki and Vy<193>sa!
@SB = 13.	Drilling the Disciples
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a knew very well, the main mission of his ç
advent. It was the redemption of mankind in general and to resusci-tate ç
Hinduism in particular.
The various reform movements that had preceded him, had had only a ç
partial effect on the Hindu society. The °rya Sam<193>j, though itoffered ç
stiff resistanceto the proselytizing activities of the Semitic religions, ç
completely ignored the entire gamut of the growth of Hindu ethos over ç
several millennia, by laying stress only on the Vedas and the Vedic ç
rituals. TheBr<193>hmo Movement on the other hand, Christianised ç
Hinduism to such an extent that it appeared more like Christianity† ç
the religion of the then ruling masters† with a veneer of Hinduism. ç
The Theosophical Movement, in spite of its empathy for Hinduism, had ç
in it weird concepts difficult to digest, especially by the intelli-gentsia. ç
Hence, there was an urgent need to resurrect and exhibit the eternal ç
values of the eternal religion, the San<193>tana-dharma. This R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
did, not by intellectual research nor by alluring oratory, but by ç
living it every moment of his life. He was amazed to find that the ç
great truths, engendered in the ancient Hindu scriptures like the ç
Upani<218>ads and the later addenda based on them like the <193>gamas ç
and the tantras, were still valid, and, worked even now, if only ç
translated seriously and sincerely, into action.
He was convinced that for the rejuvenation of Hinduism, direct spiritual ç
experience through the paths prescribed by it had to be stressed rather ç
than formalism. For this, he needed a band of dedicated young men ç
who would devote their lives not only to realising these truths but ç
also to propagating them.
@SPACE1 = 
The young men like Narendra and others were made of just this stuff. ç
Hence R<193>mak<216><218><207>a spared no efforts in training them ç
vigorously and even commanding them to take up this assignment under ç
the leadership of Narendra (the future Vivek<193>nanda), the genius.
Though this training, or rather the drilling, was quite severe, his ç
infinite love and concern for them made it bearable, or even pleasant.
Since he could easily intuit their inner nature, he would give personal ç
and individual instructions best suited to them. As a result, all ç
of them without exception, made tremendous progress in the realm of ç
the spirit.
As regards the householder-disciples, he was much more considerate. ç
Repetition of the divine name imparted to them and surrendering to ç
the chosen deity were the main instructions given to them.
He also eminently succeeded in emotionally binding them to the younger ç
disciples who would later on become monks.
@SB = 14.	The Curtain Downs
Even the basically tough constitution of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
which had withstood the severest and superhuman austerities, started ç
breaking down under the constant strain of talking, singing and dancing ç
for hours on end. Throat cancer was diagnosed in the latter part of ç
<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1885 and he was shifted to a suitable place in Calcutta ç
for better treatment, first to <185>y<193>mpuk<220>r and later to ç
the K<193>·<200>pur garden house which was a spacious building and ç
had a vast area around it, full of trees and fresh air.
As the illness progressed†in spite of the best medical treatment available†the ç
younger devotees under Narendra's leadership organised round the clock ç
service. S<193>rad<193>dev<200> did the cooking. The householder-devotees ç
defrayed the expenses.
This illness provided R<193>mak<216><218><207>a an opportunity to ç
cement the young disciples into the future monastic Order and the ç
intimate householder-devotees to stand bythem affording necessary ç
support for sustenance.
On the first January 1886, he came down from his room, strolled into ç
the garden and blessed the few householder-devotees who had gathered ç
here, liberally vouchsafing various spiritual experiences like a vision ç
of their chosen deities or ecstatic states, just by a touch or a wish. ç
This day is being observed now as the `Kalpataru Day' (the day of ç
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a becoming like the wish-fulfilling tree of ç
heaven as described in Hindu mythological lore) in all the centres ç
of the R<193>mak<216><218><207>a Order.
That in R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, these devotees were able to actually ç
see their i<218><219>adevat<193>s (chosen deities for contemplation) ç
is further proof of his being an incarnation.
Sometime during this period, R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a distributed ç
gerua cloths (cloths dyed in ochre colour generally worn by Hindu ç
sa<221>ny<193>sins or monks) to the twelve young disciples serving ç
him and made them collect food by begging in the typical fashion of ç
the traditional Hindu monks. After he himself tasted a little of it, ç
the disciples partook of the same. This, for all practical purposes, ç
was the launching of the R<193>mak<216><218><207>a Order of monks.
@SPACE1 = 
Another significant event of this period was the transferring of his ç
spiritual powers by R<193>mak<216><218><207>a to his beloved and chosen ç
disciple Narendra, in the state of sam<193>dhi (superconscious state) ç
and declaring that he would achieve great things in his later life.
Though Narendra by now had been convinced about the avat<193>r-hood ç
of R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a, a doubt did creep into his mind at ç
this time because of this serious illness. As soon as it arose, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
declared in a firm and distinct voice that he who was R<193>ma and ç
K<216><218><207>a earlier, was now R<193>mak<216><218><207>a in this ç
body, though not in the sense of Advaita Ved<193>nta which does not ç
accept any distinction between the individual soul and God.
As the D-day was approaching, which he himself had chosen by consulting ç
thealmanac, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a gave final and detailed instructions ç
to Narendra to keep the flock (the young disciples) together.
He departed on the night of 16th August 1886 at 1.02 A.M. by clearly ç
uttering the name of Mother K<193>l<200> thrice.
The mortal remains were cremated the next day at the K<193>·<200>pur ç
cremation ground. There now stands a small monument at that place.
@SB = 15.	The Fragrant Candles
The lotus blooms, bees swarm it, drink its honey and disappear by ç
the time it closes its petals.
True, the bees have been satiated by honey. But, they cannot give ç
it to others!
A burning candle can give light and light up another candle; but it ç
cannot emit fragrance.
An incense can give fragrance when burned, but it cannot give light!
How nice and wonderful it would be if there were candles that could ç
give light as also spread an aroma around them!
This is exactly what R<193>mak<216><218><207>a did when he trained ç
his disciples and launched them into the world to start a movement ç
of true religion and spirituality, a movement that would aim at raising ç
a human being from the biological to the psychological level and ultimately ç
to the level of the spirit.
Each one of these disciples who constituted the original R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
Order of monks was a light unto himself and to the world. Each one ç
of them was able to spread the R<193>mak<216><218><207>a fragrance ç
in his own way bringing peace and solace to one and all that came ç
to him. The householder disciples of the great Master stood by them ç
like a bulwark.
If today, the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission have been ç
able to spread R<193>mak<216><218><207>a's spiritual message all over ç
the world, it is not a little due to these founding fathers and their ç
worthy disciples and successors.
It is also interesting to note here that today, millions of people ç
all over the world have accepted R<193>mak<216><218><207>a as an incarnation ç
and are worshipping him as such. There are several instances of his ç
appearing in dreams and visions, consoling and protecting persons†irrespective ç
of their religion and nationality†even though they had not even heard ç
of him!
It will not be out of place here togive a brief account of these ç
direct (sa<221>ny<193>sin) disciples†except that of Vivek<193>nanda ç
which needs a more detailed treatment† arranging the names in the ç
English alphabetical order.
@S10N = Sv<193>mi Abhed<193>nanda (<P8W1>A.<|>D.<P255D><|>1866<192>1939)
Author of several exquisite Sanskrit hymns on R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
and S<193>rad<193> Dev<200>† the most popular one being `prak<216>tim ç
param<193>m'†Sv<193>mi Abhed<193>nanda was a rare combination of several ç
talents like intellectual acumen, devotional fervour and yogic introspection. ç
He was a good speaker and a prolific writer.
Known as K<193>l<200>pras<193>d Candra in hispremonastic days, he ç
was born on the 2nd October 1866 in Calcutta to enlightened parents, ç
both of whom were deeply devoted to Mother K<193>l<200>. Even from ç
his boyhood days, he was inclined towards the study of Sanskrit. As ç
he grew up he was drawn to the study of philosophical works, both ç
Eastern and Western. His desire to become a yogi brought him to R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
who immediately recognized him as a disciple of his inner circle. ç
He progressed speedily in the inner life under the guidance of the ç
Master.
After the demise of the Master, K<193>l<200> accepted sa<221>ny<193>sa ç
along with the other disciples and became `Sv<193>mi Abhed<193>-nanda'. ç
He was given to much study and contemplation during the early days ç
of his monastic life earning for himself the nickname `K<193>l<200> ç
Tapasv<200>'.
When Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda wanted a proper assistant to continue ç
the work in the West, he naturally thought of Sv<193>mi Abhed<193>nanda. ç
The latter's very first discourse on Advaita Ved<193>nta delivered ç
at London was an instant success. He later shifted to New York. He ç
toured and lecturedvery extensively in the West (both U.S.A. and ç
Europe) for a quarter of a century. His lectures attracted the cream ç
of Western intellects as also earnest seekers of Truth. He returned ç
to India in 1921 and formed a `Ramakrishna Vedanta Society' in Calcutta ç
to carry on his work in his own way. When he gave up the mortal coil ç
on the 8th September 1939, the era of the direct sa<221>ny<193>sin ç
disciples of the Master came to an end.
@S10N = Sv<193>mi Adbhut<193>nanda (d. <P8W1>A.<|>D. <P255D>1920)
Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda once declared that L<193><219>u (the premonastic ç
name of Sv<193>mi Adbhut<193>nanda) was the greatest miracle of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a. ç
If an orphan servant-boy who had absolutely no knowledge of even the ç
alphabets could rise to such a state of sainthood that scholars of ç
great book-learning would sit at his feet and listen spellbound to ç
his words of wisdom, it was nothing short of a miracle that R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
brought about.Hence the appropriateness of his name (adbhuta = wonder).
The early life of the Sv<193>mi is shrouded in mystery. Born in a ç
remote village of Bihar, and orphaned at a tender age, the boy was ç
later brought to Calcutta by his uncle. Good fortune favoured him ç
by getting him the job of a servant in the house of R<193>mcandra ç
Datta, a great devotee of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a. The holy atmosphere ç
in the house helped unfold his religious temperament. The frequent ç
errands to Dak<218>i<207>e·var brought him into close contact with ç
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a who graciously accepted him as a disciple. ç
Later on, as R<193>mak<216><218><207>a felt the need for an attendant, ç
L<193><219>u started living with him and serving him. Since the guru ç
was all-in-all for him, his service was exceptionally devoted.
@SPACE1 = 
After the demise of the Master, L<193><219>u embraced monastic life ç
and became `Sv<193>miAdbhut<193>nanda'. Though he lived a mendicant's ç
life, he seldom moved away from Dak<218>i<207>e·var, his holiest place ç
of pilgrimage. Through hard austerity and long bouts of meditation, ç
he was able to live constantly in God.
He lived for an unusually long period of nine years at the house of ç
Balar<193>m Bose, another great devotee of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a. ç
It was during this period that many earnest seekers would meet him ç
and get their doubts resolved.
He spent his last days at V<193>r<193><207>as<200> where he breathed ç
his last on April 24, 1920.
@S10N = Sv<193>mi Advait<193>nanda (<P8W1>A.<|>D.<P255D><|>1828<192>1909)
The darkness of a crisis in life often acts like the twilight before ç
dawn leading to the effulgence of the sun. When Gop<193>l Candra Ghosh ç
of Sinthi (Calcutta) lost his wife and was heartbroken, that very ç
grief led him to R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, seeking relief. The contact ç
thus established through a crisis ultimately led to glorious spiritual ç
heights.
Gop<193>ld<193>†as he was endearingly called†was older than even R<193>mak<216><218><207>a. ç
Nevertheless, the attitude of reverence and devotion he cherished ç
towards R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, his guru, was unflinching. It was ç
his good luck that made him instrumental in the birth of the future ç
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a Order of monks by gifting a few pieces of ç
ochre-coloured cloths to R<193>mak<216><218><207>a who personally ç
distributed them among Narendra, R<193>kh<193>l and others including ç
Gop<193>l himself, during his last days at K<193>·<200>pur.
Along with T<193>rak (Sv<193>mi <185>iv<193>nanda), Gop<193>ld<193> ç
was the first to join the Bar<193>nagore monastery after the departure ç
of the Master from this world. The monastic name given to him was ç
`Sv<193>mi Advait<193>nanda.' He spent a few years at the monastery, ç
shifted to V<193>r<193><207>as<200> for about five years and returned ç
to the newly established Ma<219>h at °lambaz<193>r, and later at Bel<220>r.
His advanced age prevented him from taking active part in the missionary ç
activities of the new organization.
His personal cleanliness, neat and methodical ways of doing any work, ç
had been admired even by R<193>mak<216><218><207>a.
The Sv<193>mi passed away on the 28th December 1909 at the ripe old ç
age of eighty-one.
@S10N = Sv<193>mi Akha<207><195><193>nanda (<P8W1>A.<|>D.<P255D> ç
1864<192>1937)
`I do not covet earthly kingdom, or heaven, or even salvation. The ç
only thing I desire is the removal of the miseries of the afflicted! ç
' If these words of Prahl<193>da, the great devotee, could be found ç
truly reflected in anyone's life, it was in thelife of Sv<193>mi ç
Akha<207><195><193>nanda, the third President of the R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
Order. The Sv<193>m<200>, known as Ga<209>g<193>dhar Gha<219>ak before ç
ordination into sa<221>ny<193>sa, was born on the 30th September 1864 ç
in Calcutta. Even in his boyhood-days Ga<209>g<193>dhar was deeply ç
religious and orthodox to the point of being dubbed as `oldish' even ç
by R<193>mak<216><218><207>a himself<|>! As a corrective measure R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a ç
introduced him to Narendran<193>th (Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda) who ç
was, for all outward appearances, very heterodox, but inside him he ç
had nothing but God. This acquaintance matured into a deep and lifelong ç
friendship between them.
After the demise of the Master, Ga<209>g<193>dhar, who took monastic ç
orders and became `Sv<193>mi Akha<207><195><193>nanda,' led the unfettered ç
life of a wandering monk. For three years he roamed in the Him<193>layas ç
and visited Tibet also three times. Because of his experience in the ç
Him<193>layas, Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda took him as his guide in ç
his sojourn there.
Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda's burning words to do something for the ç
poor and illiterate masses, inspired Sv<193>mi Akha<207><195><193>nanda ç
to do some good work for the education of poor children both in Khetri ç
and in Udaipur (in Rajasthan). Finally he started an orphanage at ç
the village of Sargacchi in the Murshidabad district of Bengal to ç
where he had gone to conduct famine relief work. He and the institution ç
grew up with each other.
On the death of Sv<193>mi <185>iv<193>nanda, Sv<193>mi Akha<207><195><193>nanda ç
was elected as the third President of the R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
Order.
The Sv<193>mi had a flair for learning languages, which brought him ç
into intimate contact with the people wherever he went. His childlike ç
simplicity endeared him to one and all. His austerity and scholarship ç
were a source of inspiration for many.
He breathed his last on February 7, 1937.
@S10N = Sv<193>mi Brahm<193>nanda (<P8W1>A.<|>D.<P255D> 1863<192>1922)
Sv<193>mi Brahm<193>nanda, the `Spiritual Son' of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, ç
was the first President of the R<193>mak<216><218><207>a Order. Known ç
as R<193>kh<193>l Candra Ghosh in his premonastic days,he was born ç
at Sikra, a village near Calcutta, on the 21st January 1863, of aristocratic ç
parents. During his highschool days atCalcutta he came into contact ç
with Narendran<193>th (Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda) which developed ç
into an intimate lifelong friendship. Even from his childhood days ç
he was given to devotional moods bordering on mysticism, which naturally ç
led to indifference to studies. His father got him married at an early ç
age to ward off the religious pursuits from his mind and fix him up ç
in the world. Strange to say, this very tie of marriage brought him ç
to R<193>mak<216><218><207>a who at once recognized in him his `Spiritual ç
Son' as per the vision vouchsafed to him by the Divine Mother. Thus ç
started a course of spiritual intimacy and intensive training under ç
the loving care of the guru, which resulted in several exalted mystic ç
moods and spiritual experi-ences. After the passing away of R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a, ç
R<193>kh<193>l, along with Narendra and other brother-disciples, embraced ç
monastic life under the name `Sv<193>mi Brahm<193>nanda.' He spent ç
several years as a wandering monk, visiting places of pilgrimage and ç
practising severe austerities. A little before the return of Sv<193>mi ç
Vivek<193>nanda from the West, he came back to the Bar<193>nagore ç
Ma<219>h and started living there. After his return and establishing ç
the Ramakrishna Mission, Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda made over the responsibility ç
of running the organization, to him, remembering that R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a ç
had once remarked that R<193>kh<193>l had the capacity to rule a kingdom. ç
His uncanny sense in solving even knotty problems and his spiritual ç
eminence of Him<193>layan heights took the organization to new levels ç
of glory and development. It was a long stewardship marked by work ç
and worship remarkably blended together. During his tenure as the ç
Head, he also guided many earnest spiritual seekers by taking them ç
under his protection, thus fulfilling Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda's ç
prophetic remark that he was veritably a spiritual dynamo. He passed ç
away on the 10th April 1922.
@S10N = Sv<193>mi Nira<210>jan<193>nanda (d. <P8W1>A.<|>D.<P255D><|>1904)
Nityanira<210>jan Ghosh, more commonly known as Nira<210>jan, was ç
probably born in the village Rajarhat-Vi<218><207>upur (Bengal), but ç
lived in Calcutta with his uncle. Physically  well-built  and  majestic  in ç
appearance,  he  had  somehow  become associated with a group of spiritualists ç
who had found in him a very good medium. Having heard about the great ç
spiritual power of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, Nira<210>jan came to ç
Dak<218>i<207>e·var one day. During this very first visit, the great ç
Master told him, `My boy! If you think of ghosts and spooks, ghost ç
and spook will you become! But if you think of God, divine will be ç
your life. Which do you prefer?' And this converted him from spiritualism ç
to spiritual life. Though frank and openhearted, he was subject to ç
losing temper and consequently all sense of proportion. R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
took special care to help him overcome this weakness. Nira<210>jan ç
was one of the few who served the Master day and night during his ç
last illness. After his demise he took sa<221>ny<193>sa along with ç
others andbecame `Sv<193>mi Nira<210>jan<193>nanda.' He was mainly ç
instrumental in the monastic disciples getting the major portion of ç
the ashes of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, to be later interred at the ç
new Ma<219>h built by Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>-nanda. He had a deep devotion ç
for the Holy Mother. Though tender at heart, he could be fiercely ç
stern in the face of hypocrisy. He breathed his last on the 9th May ç
1904.
@S10N = Sv<193>mi Prem<193>nanda (<P8W1>A.<|>D.<P255D> 1861<192>1918)
The name `Sv<193>mi Prem<193>nanda' given to B<193>bur<193>m by Sv<193>mi ç
Vivek<193>nanda at the time of accepting the monastic orders, was ç
a true reflection of his basic trait, universal love (prema = love). ç
Born to affluent parents on December 10, 1861, B<193>bur<193>m completed ç
his early schooling in his village of °n<219>pur (Bengal), came to ç
Calcutta for higher education and joined the Metropolitan Institution. ç
There he had the privilege of having Sri `M' (Mahendran<193>th Gupta), ç
the celebrated author of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna as his Headmaster ç
and R<193>kh<193>l (Sv<193>mi Brahm<193>nanda) as his classmate. It ç
was the latter who was instrumental in taking B<193>bur<193>m to R<193>mak<216><218><207>a. ç
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a examined B<193>bur<193>m's features in his ç
own, rather queer, way and was satisfied about hishigh spiritual ç
potentialities. Increased contacts with R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
intensified B<193>bur<193>m's inherent spiritual thirst which had ç
been manifesting itself even from his childhood. After the passing ç
away of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, B<193>bur<193>m, along with his ç
brother-disciples like Narendran<193>th (Sv<193>mi  Vivek<193>nanda)  embraced  the ç
monastic life, becoming `Sv<193>mi Prem<193>-nanda.' He spent most ç
of his life in the monasteries at Bar<193>nagore, °lambaz<193>r and ç
Bel<220>r taking care of worship, internal management and training ç
of the new monastic recruits. His innate motherly love endeared him ç
to one and all. Many a young man was reformed by his golden touch. ç
During his later sojourn in several parts of Bengal, especially in ç
East Bengal (present Bangladesh), he inspired the youth to be useful ç
to the society by voluntary service. Though a man of high spiritual ç
attainments, he was wont to hiding them and was very reticent in giving ç
expression to them. The deadly disease of K<193>l<193> °z<193>r took ç
him away on the 30th July 1918.

It is said that Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda at the time of sa<221>ny<193>sa ç
wanted to take the name `R<193>mak<216><218><207><193>nanda' for himself, ç
but gave it up in favour of <185>a·ibh<220><218>a<207>, who, he thought, ç
deserved it best. And, <185>a·i deserved it eminently by dint of his ç
devoted service to R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, especially during his ç
last days. The way he served R<193>mak<216><218><207>a when he was ç
alive and the way he carried on his worship through the relics afterhis ç
passing away were, to say the least, exemplary.
Born on the 13th July 1863†the same year as Vivek<193>nanda†in an ç
orthodox br<193>hmin family of the Hoogly district of Bengal, <185>a·i ç
got a good education and an excellent training during the early years ç
which laid the foundation for a loftycharacter. His very first visit†along ç
with his cousin <185>arat (Sv<193>mi S<193>rad<193>-nanda)†to R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
forged strong links with him, whom he accepted as the polestar of ç
his life.
During the last illness of the Master, <185>a·i toiled day and night ç
to serve him and to look to his comforts. After his demise, when the ç
relics were gathered and established in the shrine of the maiden monastery ç
at Bar<193>nagore, it was <185>a·i who took upon himself the responsibility ç
of worshipping it as also take care of his monastic brothers who had ç
been fired by an intense spirit of renunciation. No mother would have ç
served her children with greater feeling and care than <185>a·i cared ç
for them.
@SPACE1 = 
At the behest of Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda, <185>a·i†now Sv<193>mi ç
R<193>mak<216><218><207><193>nanda†came down to Madras (now Chennai) ç
to start a monastery there. By his austere life, devoted service and ç
immense scholarship, he was able to put the monastery on a solid foundation, ç
though he had often to pass through fiery ordeals. It was he who kindled ç
the interest of the people in the then princely State of Mysore, in ç
the teachings of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a and eventually start a ç
Ma<219>h at Bangalore also.
The Sv<193>mi was a combination of intellectual scholarship of the ç
highest level and devotion of the deepest type. In spite of all his ç
stern external discipline, he possessed a soft and motherly heart.
The hard incessant work he did to consolidate the work of the Ma<219>h ç
at Madras broke even his massive frame. He left the mortal coil on ç
the 21st August 1911.
@S10N = Sv<193>mi S<193>rad<193>nanda (<P8W1>A.<|>D.<P255D> 1865<192>1927)
While in ecstasy R<193>mak<216><218><207>a's beha-viour would often ç
be mysterious. One day in such a mood, he sat on the lap of a young ç
man, <185>arat Candra by name, and remarked, `I was testing how much ç
weight he could bear.' This <185>arat Candra who was later known as ç
`Sv<193>mi S<193>rad<193>nanda' successfully bore the burden of running ç
the Ramakrishna Math and Mission as its (General) Secretary for nearly ç
three decades.
<185>arat Candra Cakravarti (b. 23rd December 1865) was born at Calcutta ç
in a rich and orthodox br<193>hmin family. He and <185>a·i, who later ç
became Sv<193>mi R<193>mak<216><218><207><193>nanda, were not only ç
cousins and  family  friends  but  also  studied together at the Metropolitan ç
College of Calcutta.
The first contact of the two cousins withR<193>mak<216><218><207>a†during ç
October 1883† was a turning point in their lives. Friendship with ç
Narendran<193>th (Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>-nanda) gave a further fillip ç
to their spiritual and monastic aspirations.
<185>arat, who was an adept in serving the sick, both by temperament ç
and by experience, was one of the few important disciples of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
who nursed himduring his fatal illness. After his passing away, <185>arat ç
too joined the select band of monastics under the leadership of Narendra ç
and became `Sv<193>mi S<193>rad<193>-nanda.'
Like his other monastic brothers, Sv<193>mi S<193>rad<193>nanda also ç
spent a few years as an itinerant monk practising severe austerities. ç
However, when Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>-nanda called him for continuing ç
his work in the West, S<193>rad<193>nanda went to London first and ç
later to New York for the same. While he was proving to be a great ç
success in the West, especially due to his spiritual attainments, ç
he was recalled to India in 1898 by Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda to take ç
over the executive responsibility of the Rama-krishna Math and Mission ç
as its (General) Secretary in which capacity he served till his last ç
day.
The way he served S<193>rad<193> Dev<200>, the Holy Mother, was a ç
model par excellence for anyone to emulate. In order to builda ç
residence for her at Calcutta which would also house the office of ç
the Udbodhan, the Bengali Monthly of the R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
Order, he laboured hard. To repay the debts he had incurred in doing ç
so, he wrote the now monumental Bengali work <185>r<200> R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a ç
L<200>l<193>prasa<209>ga  (Sri Ramakrishna, the Great Master).
@SPACE1 = 
The Sv<193>mi was as learned as he was spiritual. His courtesy and ç
gentleness were so overwhelming that even the rudest of men wouldmelt ç
into submission. Equani-mity and coolheadedness, even under very trying ç
circumstances, were other remar-kable characteristics of his.
Soon after successfully convening the Ramakrishna Mission Convention ç
at Bel<220>r Ma<219>h in 1926, he took ill and shuffled off the mortal ç
coil on the 19th August 1927.
@S10N = Sv<193>mi <185>iv<193>nanda (<P8W1>A.<|>D.<P255D> 1854<192>1934)
Sv<193>mi <185>iv<193>nanda, the second President of the R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
Order, was popularly known as `Mah<193>puru<218> Mah<193>r<193>j.'
Born probably in 1854 at B<193>r<193>sat of West Bengal, in a respectable ç
and deeply religious family, T<193>rak†that was his original name†got ç
a good education, both secular and spiritual. When he was working ç
in Calcutta in an English firm, he got an opportunity of seeing R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
about whom he had already heard. Later, when he met R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
at Dak<218>i<207>e·var, the latter was pleasantly surprised to learn ç
that he was the son of R<193>mkan<193>i Gho<218><193>l, his old acquaintance. ç
Needless to say that T<193>rak had the full approval of his father ç
for becoming a disciple of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a.
T<193>rak was the first person to jointhe monastery at Bar<193>nagore ç
after the demise of the Master, and was christened `Sv<193>mi <185>iv<193>nanda' ç
while receiving the monastic orders. Though T<193>rak had been married, ç
he had successfully kept up the vow of brahmacarya (celibacy). This ç
made Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda remark in later days thathe was a ç
`Mah<193>puru<218>.' This name stuck and he became known as `Mah<193>puru<218> ç
Mah<193>r<193>j.' Like his brother-disciples, he also spent a few ç
years as an itinerant monk. But he had to settle down at the monastery ç
in 1897 after the triumphant return of Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda from ç
the West. For some time he was in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) also, preaching ç
Ved<193>nta at the behest of Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda. He also took ç
a leading part in the first plague relief work of the Ramakrishna ç
Mission in 1899. It was he who started the °·rama at V<193>r<193><207>as<200>.
But the most memorable part of his life was during his stewardship ç
of the Ramakrishna Organizations as the President from 1922 to 1934, ç
when he blessed a large number of people with initiation and brought ç
spiritual solace and comfort to thousands of devotees. He passed awayon ç
the 20th February 1934 after a protracted illness which never alienated ç
him from his Lord, whose presence he was constantly aware of. He was ç
one of the finest examples of the fact that the beauty and sublimity ç
of the inner life of a holy man can never be described in words but ç
can only be tangibly felt.
@S10N = Sv<193>mi Subodh<193>nanda (<P8W1>A.<|>D.<P255D> 1867<192>1932)
At the behest of Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda, but most reluctantly, ç
Sv<193>mi Subodh<193>-nanda rose to speak before a gathering of monks ç
and novices of the Ma<219>h. And lo! There was an earth-quake! (It ç
was the earthquake of 1897.) It was really an `earth-shaking' speech!
Whether the speech was `earth-shaking' or not, the Sv<193>mi could ç
certainly help even the lowliest in spirits, to shake off his  dejection.  He  was  a  wonderful ç
combination of compassion, love, childlike simplicity and profound ç
spiritual wisdom.
His premonastic name was Subodh Candra Ghosh. He was born in Calcutta ç
on the 8th November 1867. His parents were deeply religious by nature ç
which automatically left its influence on the son also.
Coming to know of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a through a Bengali book ç
of his teachings, Subodh lost no time in meeting the Saint of Dak<218>i<207>e·var. ç
Even during the first two visits, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a guaged ç
the spiritual potential of the boy and put him into a deep meditation ç
by mystic methods.
Subodh  joined  the  Bar<193>nagore monastery along with the other ç
disciples of the Master and got the name `Sv<193>mi Subodh<193>nanda' ç
after ordination. Because of his simple and childlike nature, he was ç
endearingly called `Khoka Mah<193>r<193>j' (khoka= child) by his ç
monastic brothers. After much austerities and itinerant life, the ç
Sv<193>mi settled down to a life of service to the suffering humanity. ç
He was very actively associated with many of the relief works of the ç
Ramakrishna Mission. He was extremely liberal in the matter of initiation ç
also, especially towards the weaker sections of the society, whom ç
he tried to help in all possible ways.
The Sv<193>mi passed away on the 2nd December 1932.

1865<192>1914)
The depression brought about by the loss of a gold watch led the young ç
S<193>rad<193>prasanna to Dak<218>i<207>e·var, seeking peace. Master ç
Mah<193>·aya, the celebrated author of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna ç
who was his teacher, led him to his future guru. The first visit itself ç
forged strong links between them. Fearing that his religious inclination ç
and frequent visits to the Saint of Dak<218>i<207>e·var might ultimately ç
induce him to become a monk, his relatives tried hard to change his ç
mind, taking recourse to, in the process, religious rites and charms. ç
But nothing worked.And, S<193>rad<193>prasanna became `Sv<193>mi ç
Trigu<207><193>-t<200>t<193>nanda.'
The Sv<193>mi had a strong constitution and was a dare-devil. During ç
his itinerant days he had often been on the brink of disaster and ç
was miraculously saved. It is said that he once underwent surgery ç
for fistula without anaesthetics.
He never cared for his personal comforts but was ever eager to serve ç
others. The famous relief work he organized at Dinajpur (now in Bangladesh) ç
bears testimony to this.
At the behest of Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda, Sv<193>mi  Trigu<207><193>t<200>t<193>nanda  started  the ç
Udbodhan, the Bengali Monthly of the R<193>mak<216><218><207>a Order, ç
and assiduously built it up.
When Sv<193>mi Tur<200>y<193>nanda returned to India from San Francisco, ç
it was Trigu<207><193>t<200>t<193>nanda who was entrusted with the ç
responsibility of organizing the Ved<193>nta work there. It was he ç
who built the first Hindu temple in the West.
The great life came to an abrupt end as a result of a mad man's act ç
of throwing a bomb. He breathed his last on the 10th January 1914.
@S10N = Sv<193>mi Tur<200>y<193>nanda (<P8W1>A.<|>D.<P255D> 1863<192>1922)
A few people there are, who appear to live in this world, but do not ç
really belong here. Sv<193>mi Tur<200>y<193>nanda was one of them. ç
Born in a religious family, of br<193>hma<207>a parents, on the 3rd ç
January 1863 (just nine days prior to the advent of Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda), ç
Harin<193>th Ca<219><219>op<193>-dhy<193>ya†that was his premonastic ç
name† was given to much orthodox observances even in his younger days. ç
An innate desire for liberation in this very life, kindled by the ç
study of Ved<193>ntic works brought him to R<193>mak<216><218><207>a. ç
The Master through his deep spiritual insight and all-encompassing ç
love, quickly won his heart. Not only that, he soon discovered and ç
destroyed two unhealthy trends in his personality† abhorrence of womankind ç
and excessive reliance on self-effort.
After accepting the monastic robes and vows, Harin<193>th became `Sv<193>mi ç
Tur<200>y<193>-nanda.' His orthodox mental make-up made him undertake ç
long and arduous journeys as an itinerant monk, and practise severe ç
austerities as also study of the scriptures. Though he had great love ç
and respect for Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda, he was at first averse ç
to active missionary work. But Sv<193>m<200>j<200>'s love melted his ç
heart. He accompanied Sv<193>m<200>j<200> to the United States and ç
worked there for about three years. The Shanti Ashrama in California ç
was practically his creation.
After returning to India he spent his days mostly in austerity and ç
in training the younger generation of monks. His burning spirit of ç
renunciation, deep faith in the Divine Mother, and insight into theintricacies ç
of the scriptures left an indelible impression on everyone that came ç
into contact with him. His fortitude and the control he could exercise ç
over his body were astonishing.
He left the body on the 21st July 1922.

1868<192>1938)
@SPACE = 
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a one day challenged a young man to wrestle ç
with him. The tall and hefty youth put him down in no time. And the ç
wonder of wonders, the young man soon felt a power entering from R<193>mak<216><218><207>a's ç
body into his own, making him completely powerless! That was howHariprasanna ç
had one of his early encounters with the Master.
Born on the 28th October 1868 in a respectable br<193>hma<207>a family ç
at Belgharia (Calcutta), Hariprasanna Ca<219><219>op<193>dhy<193>ya ç
(the pre-monastic name of Sv<193>mi Vij<210><193>n<193>-nanda) received ç
a good education from his parents. He became an engineer and rose ç
to the position of District Engineer in the erstwhile State of United ç
Provinces, before renouncing the world.
From his very first visit, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a spotted him out ç
as one belonging to the inner circle and a future monk. He took particular ç
care to instill in him the ideal of brahmacarya or celibacy. Hisvisits ç
to Dak<218>i<207>e·var and contact with the Master laid a firm foundation ç
for his spiritual life.
When the Master passed away, Hariprasanna who was still a student ç
at Patna (in Bihar), had a strange vision in which he saw R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
as if in flesh and blood, standing before him.
Since he had lost his father early and had to support his mother, ç
he was obliged to take to government service, but kept in touch with ç
the disciples of the Master, especially Narendran<193>th (Sv<193>mi ç
Vivek<193>nanda). Later†in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1896, to be more precise†he ç
gave up the world and joined the Ma<219>h then at °lambaz<193>r, andbecame ç
`Sv<193>mi Vij<210><193>n<193>nanda' after ordination.
@SPACE1 = 
Since he was an engineer with good experience in building construction, ç
he was entrusted by Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda himself with the task ç
of building the Ma<219>h campus as also preparing suitable plans for ç
a memorial temple of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a. So he prepared it ç
in consultation with a noted European architect of Calcutta and Sv<193>m<200>j<200> ç
approved of the same. Due to the sudden demise of Sv<193>m<200>j<200> ç
and lack of funds, the project had to wait for a long time to be taken ç
up. It was completed and dedicated by Sv<193>mi Vij<210><193>n<193>nanda ç
himself on the 14th of January 1938.
A group of young men in Allahabad had formed themselves into an association ç
called `Brahmav<193>din Club' with a view to uplifting themselves ç
morally and spiritually. They had done so under the inspiration of ç
a devotee of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a. This devotee had left Allahabad ç
in 1900. As luck would have it, Sv<193>mi Vij<210><193>n<193>nanda ç
arrived at Allahabad in the same year as a wandering monk. The young ç
men who were delighted to have a disciple of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
amongst them requested the Sv<193>mi to live in the rented premises ç
of their Club and guide them. The Sv<193>mi agreed and lived there ç
for nearly ten years, spending most of his time in austerity and study. ç
He later on established a permanent branch of the Ramakrishna Math ç
at Allahabad in 1910.
The Sv<193>mi was a great scholar, not only in Sanskrit and religio-philosophical ç
works but also in astronomy and astrology.
@SPACE1 = 
He was elected the President of the R<193>mak<216><218><207>a Order ç
in 1937 after the demise of Sv<193>mi Akha<207><195><193>nanda. He ç
strove hard to complete the construction of the temple of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
at Bel<220>r Ma<219>h, which he successfully did and dedicated in ç
January 1938 as already indicated. He then retur-ned to Allahabad ç
and passed away on the 25th April the same year. The body was consigned ç
to the sacred waters of the Trive<207><200>, at the confluence of ç
the rivers Ga<209>g<193> and Yamun<193>, and the invisible Sarasvat<200>.

Though counted among the disciples of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a and ç
guided by him, Sv<193>mi Yog<193>nanda was the first initiated disciple ç
of S<193>rad<193> Dev<200>, popularly known as the `Holy Mother'. ç
Like the Mother whom he served meticulously with matchless devotion, ç
his life was very unobtrusive for all outward appearances but very ç
deep in inner mystic experiences, of which he sometimes gave a hint ç
or two. Born in 1861 in an orthodox br<193>hma<207>a family which ç
was in indigent circumstances but had once been aristocratic and rich, ç
Yog<200>ndra†the premonastic name of the Sv<193>m<200>†was by nature ç
indrawn, gentle and shy. The desire to pluck a nice flower in the ç
Dak<218>i<207>e·var garden brought him face to face with R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
whom Yogin mistook for a gardener working there! He got the flower ç
all right, but in the process, himself became a `flower plant' to ç
be tended by a great gardener of lives. Though married, the world ç
could never drag his mind down to worldliness. Just as pure gold cannot ç
be shaped into ornaments but has got to be alloyed with a small quantity ç
of other metals, R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a had to `alloy' him with ç
a bit of harshness to counter his too gentle a personality that could ç
not last in this mundane world. But the disciple was not a goody goody ç
simpleton. He could exercise his highly critical discernment even ç
against his own guru or leader (Sv<193>mi Vivek<193>nanda) when he ç
thought it necessary. He was a good organizer. He had successfully ç
attracted and inspired many a young man to the monastic life. He was ç
extraordinarily devoted to the Holy Mother whom he served till the ç
last day of his life. His congenitally frail constitution could not ç
stand the rigours he chose to impose upon himself resulting in a rather ç
premature death on March 28, 1899.
@SB = 16.	Philosophy of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a
@S10 = Introduction
Man is often described as a rational animal. Once the animal in him ç
is reasonably satisfied by the provision of basic biological and some ç
psychological needs, the rational part gets an opportunity to evolve ç
to higher levels. Philosophy, including metaphysics, is one of the ç
highest aspects of this evolution.
The Indian philosophical systems have developed not only as a result ç
of intellectual speculations but also of mystical intuition. Hence ç
the name `dar·ana' (lit., `seeing'), usually applied to them. The ç
topics most commonly discussed by these dar·anas are generally four: ç
the world and its creation or evolution; the existence, nature and ç
attributes of the Absolute or God; the nature of man; and the goal ç
of human life.
Different standpoints and differing views on these topics of discussion ç
have naturally led to a variety of schools. These schools are broadly ç
divided into two classes: the <193>stika and the n<193>stika. The ç
former accept the authority of the Vedas whereas the latter do not. ç
The Ved<193>nta Dar·ana belongs to the former class and has gained ç
a pre-eminent place in it due to its judicious combination of reasoning ç
and acceptance of the authority of the Vedas as also due to its long, ç
unbroken tradition.
The word `Ved<193>nta' means the `end or essence of the Vedas.' The ç
Upani<218>ads, the Brahmas<220>tras and the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> ç
(collectively known as the prasth<193>natraya), as also all other ç
allied literature based on them, form the sources of Ved<193>nta. ç
Differing interpretations of the prasth<193>natraya, especially of ç
the Brahma-s<220>tras, have given rise to different schools of Ved<193>nta, ç
of which Advaita, Vi·i<218><219><193>dvaita and Dvaita are well-known.
@S10 = Advaita of <185>a<209>kara
Among these three schools, again it is the Advaita which has gained ç
greater currency and is more widely known.
According  to  <185>a<209>kara,  the  chief expounder of this school, ç
the ultimate Truth is one and one only, and it is Brahman. This Brahman ç
is Sat-Cit-°nanda (`Existence-Knowledge-Bliss-Absolute') and is without ç
form (nir<193>k<193>ra) and without attributes (nirgu<207>a). The ç
world in which we live, move and have our being, is unreal since it ç
is only an appearance in Brahman, like that of a snake in a rope, ç
due to ignorance or illusion. However, as long as this ignorance or ç
illusion is not transcended and Brahman is not realized as It is, ç
this world of appearance, which is the ground of our experience, is ç
given a tentative and empirical reality. When this empirical reality ç
is admitted for the world, its creation or evolution, its sustenance, ç
and its destruction or involution, have also to be admitted. Looked ç
at from this angle and conceding Brahman as the ground of evolution ç
and involution of the world, It becomes ®·vara or God, the supreme ç
Ruler of creation. This ®·vara creates, sustains and destroys the ç
world out of his power of m<193>y<193>.
As regard the individual souls, <185>a<209>kara posits that they are ç
really identical with Brahman, their separate identity and bondage ç
in the world being due to the ignorance (avidy<193>) of their real ç
nature. This ignorance is beginningless (an<193>di) but can be ended ç
through knowledge (j<210><193>na) of their real nature as °tman or ç
Self identical with Brahman or Absolute. Since it is ignorance (avidy<193> ç
or aj<210><193>na) that has caused bondage for the individual soul, ç
<185>a<209>kara maintains that knowledge (vidy<193> or j<210><193>na) ç
alone can give liberation, though he admits that selfless action (ni<218>k<193>ma ç
karma) and devotion to God (bhakti) can be useful preliminary disciplines.In ç
the state of liberation, the individual Self merges in Brahman, completely ç
losing its identity.
@S10 = R<193>mak<216><218><207>a's Views
@S8ITAL = BRAHMAN
@EMERGENCY = Now let us see how R<193>mak<216><218><207>a's philosophy ç
compares with that of <185>a<209>kara. At the very outset, it has ç
to be made clear that R<193>mak<216><218><207>a never propagated a ç
system of philosophy of his own. He experienced the Truth directly ç
and then spoke out of the fulness of that experience. Hence, we have ç
to piece together his teachings on these aspects of philosophy given ç
at random in his conversations.
Like  <185>a<209>kara,  R<193>mak<216><218><207>a  also accepts Brahman ç
as the highest and the only reality. He also accepts It as nirgu<207>a ç
and nir<193>k<193>ra in Its aspect as the Absolute. But, unlike <185>a<209>kara, ç
he does not accept God (®·vara), the aspect of Brahman with form (s<193>k<193>ra) ç
and with attributes (sagu<207>a), as either illusory or as a reality ç
of a lower order. To him, God is both formless and possessed of form. ç
Not only that, He is beyond both these too! Says he: `God is formless, ç
and God is possessed of form too. And He is also that which transcends ç
both form and formlessness. He aloneknows what all He is.' (Sayings ç
of Sri Ramakrishna, 871).
@SPACE1 = 
He calls the Absolute as Brahman, in Its eternal (nitya) aspect, i.e., ç
when It is at rest and inactive. The same in Its sportive (l<200>l<193>) ç
aspect, when involved in theprocess of creation, preservation and ç
destruction, he calls <185>akti or K<193>l<200>, the same as ®·vara ç
or God. So, according to him, Brahman and <185>akti are one and inseparable. ç
`The distinction between Brahman and <185>akti is really a distinction ç
without a difference. Brahman and <185>akti are one (abhinna), just ç
as fire and its burning power are one. Brahman and <185>akti are one, ç
just as milk and the whiteness of milk are one. Brahman and <185>akti ç
are one, just as a gem and its brightness are one. You cannot conceive ç
of the one without the other, or make a difference between them.' ç
(ibid, 857.) `God the Absolute and God the Personal are one and the ç
same. Belief in the one implies belief in the other. Fire cannot be ç
thought of apart from its burning power, nor can its burning power ç
be thought of apart from it. Again, the sun's rays cannot be thought ç
of apart from the sun, nor the sun, apart from its rays. You cannot ç
think of the whiteness of milk apart from its milky whiteness. Thus ç
the Absolute cannot be thought of apart from the idea of God with ç
attributes, i.e., Personal God and vice versa.' (ibid, 856.) `The ç
Primordial Power and Supreme Brahman are identical†it is like the ç
snake and its wriggling motion.' (The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, ç
1947 edn., p.263)
@S8ITAL = M°Y°
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a accepts m<193>y<193> as the veil that keeps ç
God hidden from our sight. He compares it to a small patch of cloud ç
that can hide the big sun from our view, or like the weeds that cover ç
placid water. He also holds, like the S<193><209>khyas, that as soon ç
as m<193>y<193> is discovered, it disappears. But he is a little more ç
considerate towards this m<193>y<193> than the advaitins, because ç
he accepts that it has two aspects, the vidy<193>- m<193>y<193> and ç
the avidy<193>-m<193>y<193>. The former helps a bound soul to get ç
liberation by giving him discrimination and non-attachment. It is ç
the latter, manifested as lust, lucre and egoism, that really binds ç
him.
Again, this explanation which leads to the corollary that a spiritual ç
aspirant should take recourse to vidy<193>-m<193>y<193> to nullify ç
the effects of avidy<193>-m<193>y<193>, even as one thorn (needle) ç
is used to remove another thorn and then both are thrown away, adds ç
a new dimension to the philosophy of spiritual practice (s<193>dhan<193>). ç
By ingeniously avoiding the need to propitiate a Personal God to remove ç
this m<193>y<193>, the purely Advaitic standpoint is maintained.
As regards the locus of m<193>y<193>, there is no unanimity among ç
the traditional advaitic schools. But R<193>mak<216><218><207>a solves ç
the problem convincingly by saying that it is located in Brahman, ç
but acts on the individual souls (j<200>vas), like the poison of a ç
snake which is contained in its mouth and yet does not affect it in ç
any way, but acts on those bitten by it. He thus absolves Brahman ç
of any imperfection or limitation due to m<193>y<193>.
@S8ITAL = CREATION
Coming to creation, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a gives it a much greater ç
degree of reality than <185>a<209>kara. He calls it the l<200>l<193> ç
aspect of Brahman and hence real, though not eternal. It is like ice-crystals ç
appearing on water and again dissolving back in water. The ice-crystals ç
are as real as water, but do not endure permanently.
A person ascending the staircase to reach the roof of a building denies ç
at first any `roofness' to the stairs. But he discovers after reaching ç
the roof that the stairs are also made of the same material as the ç
roof. In the same way, though a man of wisdom (j<210><193>ni) may ç
deny the world as not Brahman, when he becomes a man of `supreme wisdom' ç
(vij<210><193>ni), through more complete realization, he accepts that ç
the world is also Brahman, since nothing exists apart from Brahman. ç
This theory gives us a greater insight with the help of which we can ç
understand better, the activities of a j<200>vanmukta, one who is ç
liberated even while living.
@S8ITAL = ®<185>VARA OR GOD
In <185>a<209>kara's Advaita, Brahman the Absolute is not very responsive ç
to human emotions or prayers. The ®·vara we bankon is either unreal ç
or has a precarious existence. But according to R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a, ç
®·vara who is Brahman in Its l<200>l<193>- aspect, is real and responsive, ç
and hence the entire gamut of devotional practices (bhakti-s<193>dhan<193>) ç
acquires validity and leads to fulfilment. Instead of being a secondary  s<193>dhan<193>,  as  in  traditional ç
advaita, bhakti is a primary s<193>dhan<193> placed on an equal footing ç
with j<210><193>na; and this is achieved within the broad framework ç
of Advaita which both accept as the final truth.
Closely connected with this topic is the concept of the avat<193>ra ç
or incarnation of God. <185>a<209>kara, constrained by the extreme ç
stance of advaita which he is obliged to adopt, is very apologetic ç
about the whole doctrine (vide his commentary on the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> ç
4.6-9). R<193>mak<216><218><207>a however has no such constraints ç
since he accepts both the nitya and the l<200>l<193> aspects of Brahman ç
as equally real and valid. Once the l<200>l<193>-aspect is accepted ç
as real, there should be no difficulty at all in according reality ç
to the avat<193>ra of God also. God being omniscient and omnipotent, ç
can do anything he likes. None can put any limitation on his power. ç
If it is his will, he can be born as a human being and sport through ç
it. In fact, he does sportthrough the human body to bring enlightenment ç
to the bound souls, out of his infinite compassion for them. And again, ç
since the incarnation is God Himself, seeing him is equivalent to ç
seeing God. To touch the river Ga<209>g<193>, it is not necessary ç
to touch the entire stretch of water from the Gomukh (the birth-place ç
of the river) to the Ga<209>g<193>s<193>gar (the place where the river ç
joins the sea). It is enough if it is touched at Dak<218>i<207>e·var!
@S8ITAL = IMMANENCE OF GOD
For <185>a<209>kara the world is only an illusory appearance in Brahman, ç
like silver in nacre. Brahman thus being the substratum of the world, ç
appearance cannot be, strictly speaking, immanent in it. Immanence ç
implies a much greater degree of reality for the substance in which ç
immanence of the other is recognized. The Upani<218>ads clearly speak ç
of divine immanence in the world and the living beings (vide Taittir<200>ya ç
Upani<218>ad 2.6; Aitareya Upani<218>ad 1.3.12; Ch<193>ndogya ç
Upani<218>ad 6.3.2). R<193>mak<216><218><207>a teaches not only of ç
divine immanence in all beings and things but also of its manifestation ç
in different degrees. Says he: `Every object is N<193>r<193>ya<207>a ç
(i.e., God). Man is N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, the animal is N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, ç
the sage is N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, the knave also is N<193>r<193>ya<207>a. ç
All that exists is N<193>r<193>ya<207>a. The Deity (N<193>r<193>ya<207>a) ç
sports in various aspects. All things are his diverse forms and the ç
manifestations of his glory.' (Sayings, 890.) `God is in all men, ç
but all men are not in God; that is why they suffer.' (Sayings, ç
889.) `The manifestation of <185>akti (the Divine Power) varies in ç
varying centres of activity; for variety is the law, not sameness. ç
God is immanent in all creatures; he is even in the ant. The difference ç
is in manifestation only.' (Sayings, 892.)
@S8ITAL = J®VA OR INDIVIDUAL SOUL
Coming to the nature of the j<200>va or man, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
admits that in his essential nature he is God Himself: `The soul enchained ç
is man, but when free from the chain (m<193>y<193>), it is the Lord.' ç
(Sayings, 20) `What is the relation between the j<200>v<193>tman ç
and the Param<193>tman? As a current of water seems to be divided ç
into two when a plank of wood is placed against it edgewise, so the ç
Indivisible appears divided into two, the j<200>v<193>tman and the ç
Param<193>tman, due to the limitation of m<193>y<193>.' (Sayings, ç
21) `Water and a bubble on it are one and the same. The bubble has ç
its birth in the water, floats on it, and is ultimately resolved into ç
it. So also the j<200>v<193>tman and the Param<193>tman are one and ç
the same, the difference between them being only one of degree. For, ç
one is finite and limited while the other is infinite; one is dependent ç
while the other is independent.' (Sayings, 22.)
@S8ITAL = CAUSE OF HIS BONDAGE
What then is it that causes his bondage? R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
attributes it to egoism, brought about by the avidy<193>-m<193>y<193>. ç
On a deeper analysis of this `I,' it will be found to be non-existent ç
even as nothing is leftover when we go on peeling an onion. And yet, ç
it can create no end of troubles. Not only that, it is extremely difficult ç
to get rid of! How then can we get rid of it? Classifying the ego ç
into two groups, the ripe-ego and the unripe-ego, R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a ç
advises us to cultivate the ripe-ego to counter the unripe one: `If ç
you find that you cannot drive off this feeling of ``I,'' then let ç
it remain as the ``servant I.'' There is not much to fear from the ç
ego which is centred in the thought, ``Iam the servant of God, I ç
am his devotee.'' Sweets cause dyspepsia, but not sugar-candy which ç
is an exception. The ``servant I,'' the ``I'' of a devotee, the ``I'' ç
of a child<192> each of these is like a line drawn with a stick on ç
the surface of water; this ``I'' does not last long.' (ibid, 121.)
In this connection he gives the unique example as to how the liberated ç
souls continue to live in this world and teach others even after their ç
egoism has been wiped out: `As a piece of rope, when burnt, retains ç
its form, but cannot serve to bind, so is the ego which is burnt by ç
the fire of supreme knowledge.' (ibid, 132.)
@S8ITAL = FOUR TYPES OF J®VAS
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, though conceding that all the j<200>vas, ç
in the ultimate analysis, are equal, yet classifies them into four ç
groups: the baddha (bound), the mumuk<218>u (struggling for liberation), ç
the mukta (emancipated) and the nityasiddha (ever-free).
Those of the last group are born toteach mankind. The first group ç
is so deeply engrossed in the world of senses that it is least interested ç
in the life of the spirit. The last two groups have already reached ç
the goal of their lives. Hence it is the second group that needs special ç
attention.
@S8ITAL = THE GOAL OF LIFE
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a says that the goal of life is God-realization. ç
All our miseries will end, all our problems will be solved once for ç
all, by realizing God. Following the ancient tradition, he advises ç
the aspirants to seek a competent spiritual teacher (guru) first and ç
then practise disciplines according to his directions. R<193>mak<216><218><207>a's ç
teachings contain a veritable mine of information and instructions ç
on practical spiritual life. Unlike the traditional philo-sophies ç
or religions, he is not at all dogmatic about the path leading to ç
the goal. Just as the K<193>ligh<193><219> temple can be reached through ç
several roads of Calcutta, God also can be realized through several ç
spiritual paths and disciplines. In his philosophy of s<193>dhan<193>, ç
j<210><193>na, bhakti, yoga and karma<192>all have a place. One can ç
practise them either singly or in combination. What is needed is vy<193>kulat<193>, ç
great earnestness or intense longing. In fact, this approach of his ç
can accommodate in its fold notonly all the spiritual disciplines ç
of Hinduism, but also those of other religions. He goes to the extent ç
of according a place even to the abominable practices of some t<193>ntrik ç
schools, calling them as `backdoors,' though he does not advocate ç
or recommend them.
@S8ITAL = J<178>°NA OR BHAKTI?
As regards the controversy among the various schools about j<210><193>na ç
or bhakti beingthe direct path to liberation, R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a ç
advocates devotion tempered by knowledge (j<210><193>na-mi·rita-bhakti) ç
as most suitable for this age. This standpoint avoids the extremes ç
and prevents the aspirant from becoming dry or sentimental, the dangers ç
to which he is generally exposed if he follows only one of them to ç
the exclusion of the other.
What happens to a person when he realizes God? Here, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
follows the traditional description given in the scriptures. The man ç
of realization experiences unalloyed bliss within and sees the Divine ç
everywhere. Outwardly he may not exhibit any signs of his inner joy ç
and may even behave like an abnormal person. But one thing is certain: ç
He remains unaffected by the vicissitudes of life which affect others ç
intensely. He lives in God and works for the good of others, seeing ç
God in them.
@S8ITAL = <%-2>CONTINUANCE OF BODY AFTER REALIZATION<%0>
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a says that normally a person who goes into ç
nirvikalpa sam<193>dhi (the highest state of superconsciousness) remains ç
in that state for twenty-one days and then passes away. However, a ç
few who are destined to teach mankind, return to the ordinary plane ç
of consciousness by keeping a trace of egoism without which corporeal ç
existence is impossible.
About pr<193>rabdha-karma (the result of past deeds, that have borne ç
fruit in this life) R<193>mak<216><218><207>a accepts it as inevitable ç
but assures us that a greater part of its effects can be offset by ç
the power of God's name (vide Teachings of Sri Ramakrishna, 913).
@SPACE = 
@S8ITAL = PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL
@SPACE = 
Concerning the problem of good and evil which has been debated much ç
in philosophy, R<193>mak<216><218><207>a says that the very act of ç
creation presupposes imperfection. Just as pure gold cannot be made ç
into ornaments unless it is mixedwith traces of baser metals, the ç
world cannot come into existence without m<193>y<193>. The simultaneous ç
existence of good and evil is to be counteracted through good as far ç
as possible. But the ultimate solution is to transcend both good and ç
evil by rising to supreme spiritual heights where everything is levelled ç
in God. Then neither good nor evil is recognized, just as it is impossible ç
to notice the difference in the heights of tall trees or clusters ç
of grass when one is flying high in the sky.
@SPACE = 
@S8ITAL = CAUSE OF DISAGREEMENT
@SPACE = 
Finally, a word about why there is so much disagreement and difference ç
among the various philosophical systems and religions. R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
tackles this question from two standpoints: the subjective and the ç
objective. Through the well-known story of the blind men and the elephant, ç
he tells us that when people get an incomplete or imperfect view of ç
God and preach it as the whole truth, conflicts are bound to appear. ç
This is fromthe subjective standpoint. From the objective standpoint, ç
he says that God is so great that none can comprehend him fully. He ç
alone knows what all he is. Brahman or God is the one thing that has ç
not become `ucchi<218><219>a' (food tasted and leftover) since none ç
has till now fully described him. Any attempt to size him up with ç
our limited intellect and describe him through our limited speech ç
will be as futile as the efforts of the salt-doll that wanted to gauge ç
the depths of the sea! Hence, even when people who have had genuine ç
and complete spiritual experience try to describe him (who is really ç
indescribable), their descriptions are bound to fall far short of ç
the ideal and are also apt to be different from one another.
@S10 = Conclusion
In conclusion we can safely assert that R<193>mak<216><218><207>a's ç
experiences and utterances, though similar in many respects to the ç
traditional Ved<193>nta, have much more in them that can form the ç
subject matter for a fascinating study, unravelling new vistas of ç
Ved<193>nta. After all, this is how San<193>tana Dharma has grown ç
over the millennia!
