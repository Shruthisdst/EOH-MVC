@NID = hymns, known as Rak<218>oghna-mantras, are chanted at<|>the ç
<|>appropriate places in sacrifices, while consecrating a newly-built ç
house, to prevent abortion in a woman who has conceived and so on.
The first group of 15 mantras is all addressed to Agni as Rak<218>oh<193> ç
(destroyer of demons). He is compared to a king going on invasion ç
for conquest, and requested to destroy the r<193>k<218>asas or demons.
The second group of 25 mantras is addressed to Indra and Soma, as ç
also Agni and Maruts. Here also the prayers are addressed for the ç
total annihilation of r<193>k<218>asas and asuras (demons) by pushing ç
them into the nether worlds from where there is no return.
The third group of 25 mantras is addressed to Agn<200> Rak<218>oh<193> ç
with a request to burn up all the evil spirits who are trying to disturb ç
the Vedic sacrifice.
The fourth group of 9 mantras also is addressed to Agn<200> Rak<218>oh<193> ç
and praises him. He is then requested to destroy the female fiends ç
called Y<193>tudh<193>n<200>s.
The last group of 6 mantras contains a special prayer indirectly addressed ç
to Agni, to destroy all the diseases in a pregnant woman so that abortion ç
or miscarriage is prevented.

There are several aspects of the Divine Mother (<185>akti or P<193>rvat<200>) ç

Raktac<193>mu<207><195><193> is sometimes known as Yoge·var<200> also.
In her formless aspect, she is the power pervading the whole world.
Her form is described thus: She is red in colour, wears yellow garments ç
as also bejewelled ornaments and a garland of severed human heads. ç
The crescent moon adorns her crest.
In her four hands she holds a sugarcane bow, arrow, discus and a lotus.
She is invoked for destroying one's enemies.

R<193>ma and K<216><218><207>a are the two eyes of Hindu religion, ç
philosophy, culture and ethos.
V<193>lm<200>ki's R<193>m<193>ya<207>a and Vy<193>sa's Bh<193>gavata ç
are the two foundational epics or treatises which have given birth ç
to innumerable literary works, with religio-philosophical import, ç
both in Sanskrit and in the various vernaculars of India (and even ç
in the foreign languages of South- East Asia).
One such work which has occupied almost the same place in the hearts ç
of millions of Hindus of North India, as that of V<193>lm<200>ki, ç
is the R<193>macarita-m<193>nasa (also spelt as `R<193>mcaritm<193>nas') ç
of Tulas<200>-d<193>sa <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1532-1623. Perhaps, it will not ç
be an exaggeration to state that in the Hindi speaking belts of North ç
India, it is equally or even more revered than the work of V<193>lm<200>ki.
Historically speaking, Tulas<200>d<193>sa lived in troubled times. ç
It was, according to him, only the path of bhakti or devotion, that ç
was simple to understand and easy to follow, that could restore true ç
religion in the hearts of all. Hence, the whole purpose of his work ç
was to lead the common people away from the various misleading paths ç
that were masquerading as true religion and re-establish bhakti asthe ç
supreme spiritual s<193>dhana or discipline.
Since his mouth spoke out of the fulness of the heart, filled to the ç
brim with devotion to God (as R<193>ma), and the hand just recorded ç
what his heart dictated, an exquisitely beautiful religio-literary ç
work of eternal value was effortlessly created.
The work is extremely popular due to three major factors: the universal ç
human appeal of his conception of bhakti; propounding the ethical ç
values and spiritual truths through the popular story of R<193>ma; ç
and, the unparalleled poetic genius.
Though based mainly on the R<193>m<193>-ya<207>a of V<193>lm<200>ki, ç
Tulas<200>d<193>sa has also drawn heavily from another well-known ç
work,  the  Adhy<193>tma  R<193>m<193>ya<207>a  (See <MS>ADHY°TMA ç
R°M°YAØA.<D>) a work of the 15th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>, considered ç
sometimes as a part of the Brahm<193><207><195>a Pur<193><207>a. ç
(See <MS>BRAHM°Ø£A PUR°ØA<D> also.)
The other two works from which he seems to have borrowed some incidents ç
are: the Han<220>man-n<193><219>aka (also called Mah<193>n<193><219>aka) ç
and the Prasanna R<193>ghava, a drama in seven acts, of Jayadeva ç
(12th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>).
The whole work is in the Avadh<200> dialect of Hind<200>, using mainly ç
two kinds of metres: 1) doh<193> (a couplet of four quarters in which ç
the first and the third have 13 m<193>tr<193>s or syllabic instants; ç
and, the second and the fourth, 11 each). 2)caup<193><200> (similar ç
to doh<193> but with 16 m<193>tr<193>s in each quarter).
The doh<193>s (which are of primary importance) are distributed as ç
follows, in the seven k<193><207><195>as or books, the names of which ç
are identical with those of V<193>lm<200>ki's (except the sixth which ç
is known as La<209>k<193>k<193><207><195>a instead of Yuddhak<193><207><195>a):
@SPACE1 = 
1. B<193>lak<193><207><195>a (361); 2. Ayodhy<193>k<193><207><195>a ç

(121); 7. Uttarak<193><207><195>a (130).
Each doh<193> is followed by several caup<193><200>s, the total number ç
of which exceeds five thousand.
Though  Tulas<200>d<193>sa  has  closely followed the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
of V<193>lm<200>ki, he has also wrought many changes. In fact, the ç
first part of the B<193>lak<193><207><195>a has several such changes ç
and innovations. A few of these may be mentioned here: incidents in ç
R<193>ma's childhood resembling those of K<216><218><207>a given in ç
the Bh<193>gavata; R<193>ma and S<200>t<193> seeing each other in ç
the garden of Mithil<193> and being mutually attracted; the breaking ç
of the bow of <185>iva in svaya<221>vara, before a large assembly ç
of kings; arrival of Para·ur<193>ma there, immediately after the breaking ç
of the bow, and his subjugation by R<193>ma.
@SPACE1 = 
Apart from these, other interpolations in the same k<193><207><195>a ç
are: long introductory passages  including  prayers,  dialogues between ç
the sages Y<193>j<210>avalkya and Bharadv<193>ja, a long discourse ç
on the story of <185>iva, dialogue between <185>iva and P<193>rvat<200> ç
and the stories of Vi<218><207>u's earlier incarnations.
Some more variations may also be noted.
They are: glorification of Bharata as a great devotee of R<193>ma; ç
disappearance of S<200>t<193> into the fire before the arrival of ç
the illusory deer (m<193>y<193>m<216>ga) and a shadow S<200>t<193> ç
(or M<193>y<193>s<200>t<193>) emerging out of it (who will be abducted ç
by R<193>va<207>a, the king of demons); meeting of Hanum<193>n and ç
Vibh<200><218>a<207>a after the former's arrival at La<209>k<193> ç
and the latter's help in locating S<200>t<193>; advices given by Ma<207><195>odar<200>, ç
Kumbhakar<207>a and M<193>lyav<193>n to R<193>va<207>a since they ç
had recognised R<193>ma as Vi<218><207>u himself; and, the conversation ç
between R<193>va<207>a and A<209>gada as well as the one between Trija<219><193> ç
and S<200>t<193>.
It is interesting to note that the Uttarak<193><207><195>a of R<193>macaritam<193>nasa ç
has two parts, the first part giving a description of R<193>ma's coronation ç
and that of his rule (R<193>mar<193>jya); and, the second part describing ç
the evils of Kaliyuga as also the need for d<193>syabhakti (devotion ç
to God like that of a servant towards his master) which alone can ç
lead to salvation. This second part is in the form of a dialogue between ç
the great crow K<193>kabhu·u<207><195>i and Garu<195>a the eagle-devotee ç
and servant of Lord Vi<218><207>u.
Scholars of R<193>macaritam<193>nasa sometimes discover three layers ç
or three stages of development in the work, which is not very important ç
from the standpoint of the devotee who is interested only in drawing ç
inspiration for his life.
Tulas<200>d<193>sa was an eminent teacher and propagator of the cult ç
of bhakti or devotion to God. He utilised R<193>ma's story as a very ç
effective means of spreading it. His cult of bhakti as reflected in ç
this immortal work has certain special features. They are: insistence ç
on moral conduct which is the prerequisite for practising bhakti; ç
easy availability of the way of devotion (to God) to all, irrespective ç
of their caste or status in the society; emphasising the need for ç
serving the society as per one's capacity and not looking upon the ç
life of the wandering monks with any admiration or favour.
@SPACE1 = 
Though Tulas<200>d<193>sa sometimes gives allegorical meanings also ç
in his story of R<193>ma, there is no doubt as to where his heart ç
really lies!†Brahman the Absolute comes down in the human form of ç
R<193>ma, out  of  infinite  compassion  to  save mankind!
By any standards, this magnum opus of Tulas<200>d<193>sa can hold ç
its head high in the class of literary epics of the world, whether ç
ancient or modern.

Bhadr<193>calam in the Khammam district of Andhra Pradesh, situated ç
on the bank of the sacred river God<193>var<200> is a famous place ç
of pilgrimage. The town is blessed by a beautiful temple dedicated ç
to <185>r<200> R<193>ma.
Gopanna, an educated and cultured man from a good family, was, at ç
that time, the collector of the district, the king or the chieftain ç
being a Muslim, T<193>n<200><218><193> by name.
When Pokala Dammakka, a poor lady, requested him to build a nice temple ç
for the images of R<193>ma, S<200>t<193> and Lak<218>ma<207>a which ç
she had recovered from an anthill, Gopanna built it with the State ç
funds in his charge. Enraged by this, T<193>n<200><218>a is said to ç
have imprisoned him. However, <185>r<200> R<193>ma saved him miraculously. ç
This brought about a total conversion in him and he dedicated the ç
rest of his life to spiritual pursuits. Since then, he came to be ç
known as Bhadr<193>cala R<193>mad<193>sa. According to some versions ç
Kab<200>rdas (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1440-1518) gave him this name.
He  was  well-versed  in  several languages but composed a number ç
of devotional songs in praise of R<193>ma in the Telugu language, ç

Even Ty<193>gar<193>ja (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1767-1848) the great musician ç

Guru R<193>md<193>s was the fourth of the ten Gurus of Sikhism.
He was the son of Harid<193>s, a shopkeeper, and An<220>p Dev<200> ç
who was also known as Day<193> Kaur. They belonged to the Khatr<200> ç
caste.
He was born in Chuna Mandi in Lahore district (now in Pakistan). He ç
was given the name Je<219>h<193>.
He lost both the parents when he was just seven years and was brought ç
up by his grandmother in her village Basarke.
He lived by selling cooked beans in the market place.
At the age of twelve, he shifted to Goindv<193>l, a new habitation ç
founded by Guru Amard<193>s (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1479-1574). Very soon he ç
attracted the attention of the Guru whom he joined and started serving ç
him with great sincerity and devotion. The Guru, being pleased by ç
it, gave him his daughter B<200>b<200> Bh<193>n<200> in marriage. ç
The couple stayed at Goindv<193>l itself so that they could serve ç
the Guru.
Gradually Je<219>h<193> came to be known as R<193>md<193>s.
The couple had three sons: Pr<200>ticand, Mah<193>dev and Arjandev.
Once, Guru Amard<193>s sent him to Lahore to meet the Mughal Emperor ç
Akbar (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1542-1605) who was camping there, to clear some ç
wrong notions about the teachings of the Guru. He fulfilled this assignment ç
admirably.
Before passing away Guru Amard<193>s had chosen R<193>md<193>s as ç
his successor and had instructed him to construct a pool in the land ç
specially acquired for that purpose. It was 40 kms. (25 miles) to ç
the northwest of Goindv<193>l. Gradually a town also came up around ç
the pool. This is the now famous city of Amritsar with its pool round ç
the Golden Temple.
Guru R<193>md<193>s had to take a lot of trouble to complete the work ç
due to lack of funds. However he finally succeeded in the same.
Another contribution of the Guru was the establishment of `Ma<210>j<200>s' ç
or preaching centres. The Sikh brotherhood was divided into 22 ma<210>j<200>s. ç
They had special couches on which pious Sikh teachers would sit and ç
preach the tenets of Sikhism.
Guru R<193>md<193>s was a great poet. The Guru Grantha S<193>hib ç
contains 638 hymns of his in 30 r<193>gas (musical tunes). They are ç
full of the praise of God and his name as also a s<193>dhaka's yearning ç
for God.
He passed away in 1581 after anointing his last son Arjandev, since ç
he was the most devoted and faithful disciple.

The utterance by the priest of the word `s<193>vadh<193>n' (`beware!') ç

of the boy N<193>r<193>ya<207>a to such fiery heights of renunciation ç
that he leaped out of the marriage hall like a leopard and ran away ç
never to be caught in the web of worldly life!
It was this boy N<193>r<193>ya<207>a who later on shone in the firmament ç
of Hindu saints as `Samartha' R<193>mad<193>sa (or R<193>md<193>s), ç
inspiring the king <185>iv<193>j<200> (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1627-1680) to ç
protect the religion and society of the Hindus.
R<193>mad<193>sa was born in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1608, as the second son ç
of S<220>ry<193>j<200> Pant and R<193><207><220>b<193><200>, on the ç

an incarnation of god Vi<218><207>u, took birth as a human being.
He was well-educated by his parents.
Given to deep introspection on spiritual values, he devoted twelve ç
years to tapas or austerities at a place called <187><193>ka<202><200> ç
on the bank of the sacred river God<193>var<200> near N<193>sik, a ç
famous place of pilgrimage.
Later, he toured all over India for another twelve years, studying ç
the situation in the country and also utilising the time for study ç
as well as composing religious treatises.
The last few years were spent in vigorously propagating Hinduism among ç
the masses, rousing their pride in their religion, culture and motherland, ç
and bringing about unity among them, thereby earning the title `Samartha' ç
(`the capable one') spontaneously from them all.
It was during this period that the king <185>iv<193>j<200> became ç
his disciple and drew a lot of inspiration from him.
Being a great devotee of R<193>ma andan ardent admirer of M<193>ruti ç
(or Hanum<193>n), Samartha R<193>mad<193>sa built a number of temples ç
for M<193>ruti in various towns.
He had four disciples all of whom were highly evolved souls. They ç
were:
Ra<209>gan<193>tha Sv<193>mi of Niga<195>i; Jayar<193>ma Sv<193>mi ç
of Pa<195>ag<193>v; °nandam<220>rti of  Brahman<193><202>a;  and  Ke·avam<220>rti  of ç
Hyderabad.
@SPACE1 = 
The  group  of  these  five  saints together came to be known as `Ramad<193>sa ç
Pa<210>c<193>yatana'.
The magnum opus of this saint is the famous D<193>sabodha written ç
in the Mar<193><219>hi language. It is in twenty da·akas (small chapters ç

He passed away in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1681 when his disciples were singing ç
devotional songs, with the name `R<193>ma' on his lips.
The ma<219>has (religious centres or monasteries) established by him ç

Apart from the D<193>sabodha, his other works are: Man<193>ce <185>loka, ç

It is full of the usual teachings on the Advaita Ved<193>nta as propounded ç

The following are some of the topics dealt with:
Lak<218>ma<207>a's surrender to R<193>ma and his request for spiritual ç
wisdom by which he can cross over transmigratory existence; need  to  purify  one's  mind  by  the ç
performance of one's duties as per the var<207>a and the <193>·rama; ç
aj<210><193>na being the root cause of bondage, it has to be eliminated ç
only by j<210><193>na (or <193>tmaj<210><193>na); defects accruing ç
to Vedic rituals; hence, the need to renounce karma or actions altogether; ç
to get j<210><193>na one has to approach a competent guru and get ç

Right from the age of the Upani<218>ads, the Hindu society had sheltered ç
and protected the sa<221>ny<193>sins from the problems and worries ç
of the world, and had taken care of them so well that they could pursue ç
their chosen path towards perfection unhindered.
However, the barbaric invasions from outside by the Mohammedans (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1000) and the wily manoeuvres as also the stick and carrot policy ç
of the English (since <MS>A.D.<D>1745) gradually undermined the ç
Hindu society to such an extent that it badly needed resuscitation ç
at the hands of people totally dedicated to the Hindu cause. Though ç
the various reform-movements like the Brahma Sam<193>j and the °rya ç
Sam<193>j contributed their bit to the revival and strengthening of ç
the Hindu society, their approach fell short of the requirements, ç
since they had ignored the all-comprehensive evolution of Hinduism ç
over the past millenniums and were in too great a hurry to reform ç
according to their own favourite theories.
Hence there had arisen a great need to dehypnotise the society from ç
adopting partial or alien means, and to resurrect it by utilising ç
the age-old, time-tested, methods of j<210><193>na (spiritual wisdom) ç
and tapas (austerity).

@SPACE = 
This is exactly what R<193>mak<216><218><207>a (<MS>A.D.<D>1836-1886)†more ç
well-known as <185>r<200>R<193>mak<216><218><207>a Paramaha<221>sa ç
and worshipped by millions of his devotees as an incarnation of God†did ç
during his rather short life of fifty years. He first practised vigorously ç
all the spiritual disciplines of the various facets of Hinduism and ç
came to the conclusion that they led to the same mystical experience ç
of Brahman/°tman as described in the Upani<218>ads and allied scriptures. ç
An extension of his efforts towards some alien religions also corroborated ç
the same experience.
It is this universal experience that made him declare, `As many faiths, ç
so many paths!'
Though equipped with this magni-ficent weapon of j<210><193>na (highest ç
spiritual wisdom) gained through tapas (single minded austerities), ç
R<193>mak<216><218><207>a knew very well that the task of regeneration ç
of the San<193>tanadharma (the Eternal Religion or Hinduism) and uplifting ç
this country†the Bh<193>ratavar<218>a or Bh<193>rata, the homeland ç
of spiritual wisdom for aeons†was a task that would extend beyond ç
the normal span of human life and would need the wholehearted cooperation ç
of a well-knit band of dedicated disciples.

monastic robes by R<193>mak<216><218><207>a himself† that formed the ç
core of a new monastic order that bears his name now.
They were sixteen in number and were the founders of this order. After ç
taking formal monastic vows through appropriate  rituals  they,  under  the ç
guidance of Narendran<193>th or Vivek<193>nanda (<MS>A.D.<D> 1863-1902), ç

@SB = The Motto and the Emblem
Any organisation, especially the one that bears the name of an epoch-making ç
person, needs a motto to guide it and anemblem that constantly reminds ç
and inspires. Realising this, Vivek<193>nanda placed before it the ç
motto: <193>tmano mok<218><193>rtha<221> jagaddhit<193>ya ca (`For ç
the liberation of the Self and service to the society'). He also designed ç
a charming butdistinctive emblem that effectively reflected this ç
motto. It consists of an elegant swan against the backdrop of the ç
rising sun, surrounded by wavy waters from which has arisen a beautiful ç
lotus flower along with a couple of leaves. This whole picture is ç
encircled by a hooded serpent.
Whereas the motto adds a social dimension to the hitherto, purely ç
personal, aspect of a self-centred s<193>dhana, the emblem†which graphically ç
describes a balanced combination or harmony of all the four yogas†enriches ç
that s<193>dhan<193> by making it more comprehensive.
@SB = The Bifurcation
The basic philosophy of life put before the Ramakrishna Order by Vivek<193>nanda ç
automatically led to a bifurcation of its activities into two important, ç
but parallel, areas. The <193>tmamok<218>a aspect resulted in the ç
establishment of the Ramakrishna Math, an organisation catering predominantly ç
to the spiritual needs of the monks of the order as also its votaries. ç
The jagaddhita aspect on the other hand, gave rise to another, a sister ç
organisation, concentrating solely on public service activities.
@SB = Legal Formalities
Though the Ramakrishna Order of monks was started in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1886 itself with its first monastery at Baranagore in Calcutta (now ç
Kolkata), in a dilapidated house, it was shifted to its own campus ç
in Belur, only in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1899, primarily due to the untiring ç
efforts of Vivek<193>nanda. For some time (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1895-1899) ç
it had been housed in the Alambazaar area of Calcutta also.
The Ramakrishna Math was legally registered as a trust in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1901 and the Ramakrishna Mission in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1909.
The Ramakrishna Mission Association which Vivek<193>nanda himself ç
had formally established on the 1st of May 1897, later on went out ç
of existence, once the other two institutions were given a legal shape.
Some of the aims and objects contemplated in the original Association ç
were as follows:
Preaching the truths taught by R<193>ma-k<216><218><207>a, based on ç
his life and experiences; to bring about fellowship among the followers ç
of different religious; to train men to become competent to teach ç
spiritual knowledge as well as secular sciences for the welfare of ç
the masses; to encourage arts and industries; to establish ma<219>has ç
and <193>·ramas (monasteries) in different parts of India for training ç
sa<221>ny<193>sins; to send trained sa<221>ny<193>sins to foreign ç
countries to bring about a better understanding between them and India; ç
to totally eschew politics; any other spiritual and humanitarian activities ç
in consonance with these ideals.
@SPACE1 = 
The fairly fast evolution of the order into two distinct fields of ç
work†spiritual ministry and social service†made its two wings grow ç
into two parallel organisations. Hence it is necessary to consider ç
them here in greater detail.
@SB = The Ramakrishna Math
@SPACE = 
The Ramakrishna Math is a purely monastic organisation, totally dedicated ç
to the twin ideals of ty<193>ga (renouncing everything  for  the  sake  of  spiritual ç
enlightenment) and sev<193> (service to living beings as worship of ç
God Himself).
Young men eligible for joining the monastic order as per the prescribed ç
rules of admission (which can be obtained from any centre of the Ramakrishna ç
Order) are vigorously trained by competent senior monks over a period ç
of nearly ten years after which they are initiated into sa<221>ny<193>sa ç
(monastic life) if found fit.
Insistence on meditation, study of scriptures and austerities in personal ç
life, and, on service activities as worship of God through human beings ç
in social life, will help these novices to be shaped into ideal monks ç
in course of time.
Unlike the old monastic orders, theRamakrishna Monastic Movement ç
has certain unique features. They may be listed as follows:
@SPACE = 
@S10 = A.	Non-sectarian
@SPACE = 
Though rooted firmly in the ancient Hindu monastic ideals of chastity ç
and absence of possessions, it has avoided identification with any ç
particular sect or group or even tradition. It embraces the whole ç
gamut of religio-spiritual development of the entire Hindu race over ç
the last five millennia or more. Not only that, it has provided a ç
place in itself for the people of alien religions and cultures too, ç
provided they are prepared to follow the basic monastic disciplines ç
as exemplified in the lives of Ramakrishna-Vivekananda. In fact, the ç
word `alien' is itself alien to the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda culture!
@S10 = B.	Austerity, Learning and Missionary Zeal
<185>a<209>kara, the earliest pioneer of orga-nized Hindu monasticism, ç
insisted that his disciples, who were abbots of his monasteries, keep ç
alive the spirit of tapas (austerity) and j<210><193>na (learning) ç
in their personal lives and undertake prav<193>sa (tours) for the ç
sake of prac<193>ra (dissemination of dharma or righteousness) for ç
public good. Vivek<193>nanda who realized the wisdom of this healthy ç
convention set up by <185>a<209>kara, has ordained that it be followed ç
in his monastic order too. The Ramakrishna Order is sincerely trying ç
to keep up this glorious tradition.
@S10 = C.	Group Life and Work Ethic
But, unlike the old Hindu monasticism which insisted upon a lonely ç
life, the new monastic movement advocates living in a group, thus ç
forging a Sa<209>gha (organisation). This itself has several advantages, ç
the greatest being the strengthening of one another's spiritual vibrations, ç
and the rounding off of one's angularities. Is not community life ç
itself a great discipline?
Its philosophy of service, of serving the j<200>va (the individual ç
soul) as <185>iva (God), has elevated the act of service†which would ç
have stagnated, at best, at the level of social service†to the sublime ç
levels of spiritual practice. This automatically helps the members ç
of the Sa<209>gha in their personal spiritual evolution too.
Its insistence on work ethic, especially on high quality work, of ç
which punctuality and punctiliousness are hallmarks, has set a model ç
to the people of our country. If followed properly, it can bring the ç
Kingdom of Heaven to this earth.
Its active canvassing for the total development of the human society ç
in particular, by adopting all healthy means at our disposal, including ç
science and technology as also sound and time-tested economic principles, ç
is another unique feature that distinguishes it from the old monastic ç
systems which kept aloof from the social life in all its aspects, ç
though deriving all benefits from the society!
@S10 = D.	Attitude towards Social Reform
It is true that this monastic movement does not directly involve itself ç
in social reform activities. But, by quietly working for man-making ç
and character-building, by inculcating the right values and attitudes ç
in the minds of men, it is actually helping the society to carry out ç
`root and branch reform' as Vivek<193>nanda put it.
@S10 = E.	Attitude towards Politics
However, Vivek<193>nanda the prophet of modern India, with an uncanny ç
vision of the future, forbade his organization strictly from taking ç
part in any political movement or activity. Why? Because the monk ç
is a world-citizen, nay, a man of God! (And, world-citizens do not ç
dabble in politics, whereas Godmen have no politics at all.) Even ç
though this decision of his was not relished by some of the participants ç
of the early years of freedom movement, later history has proved that ç
he was absolutely right. Not only that, almost all the great national ç
leaders were inspired by his speeches and writings.
Some facts may now be adduced here to give an idea of the work that ç
is being done by the Ramakrishna Math institutions:
<MS>NATURE OF WORK<|>:<D> ritualistic worship of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a, ç
the presiding deity; personal interviews to aspirants giving the necessary ç
spiritual guidance; celebration of all important Hindu festivals as ç
also the birthdays of the great religious leaders of Hinduism; publication ç
of Hindu religious works and journals; preaching of religio- spiritual ç
subjects often related to or based on the life and teachings of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a ç
as also his monastic disciples; running of libraries of religio-philosophical ç
literature; special programmes for the youth to supplement their education ç
with moral and spiritual values and so on.
<MS>CENTRES<|>:<D> There were 53 centres of the Math including 18 in ç
foreign countries in April 2003.
@SPACE = 
@SB = The Ramakrishna Mission
@SPACE = 
Unlike the Ramakrishna Math, the Ramakrishna Mission is a public institution ç
admitting lay members too, who subscribe to its philosophy and policies. ç
The individual centres, though run by themonastic members, generally ç
have a Managing Committee with non-monastic lay devotees also. The ç
work of these centres is spread over the following fields:
Running of schools, colleges and hostels for students; starting and ç
managing medical institutions like dispensaries, hospitals and medical ç
camps; rural welfare activities  including  integrated  rural development ç
schemes; relief and rehabilitation measures during periods of natural ç
or manmade calamities like famines, floods, earthquakes, riots, fire-disasters, ç
cyclones and so on.
<MS>CENTRES<|>:<D> There were in all in April 2003, 59 centres of the ç
Mission including 8 in foreign lands.
In addition to these, there were 25 combined Math and Mission centres, ç
of which 6 were outside India.
The foreign countries where these centres  are  located  are:  Argentina, ç
Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Fiji, France,  Japan,  Malaysia,  Mauritius, ç
Netherlands, Russia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, United Kingdom ç
and United States of America.
@SB = Administration
The Math is managed by the Trustees who are all senior monks of the ç
Order and the Mission by a Governing Body whose members are the same ç
as the Trustees, the distinction made being purely for legal purposes.
After ascertaining the opinions of the senior monks of the Order, ç
the Trustees elect from among themselves a President, one to three ç
Vice-presidents, a General Secretary and four Assistant Secretaries.
The President†also called the `Sa<209>ghaguru'†is the supreme Head ç
of the whole organisation and the sole authority for giving sa<221>ny<193>sa ç
or administering the vows of monastic life.
He and the Vice-presidents are also empowered to grant mantrad<200>k<218><193> ç
(initiation into spiritual life) to devotees aspiring for it.
The  General  Secretary  is  the administrative head of the organisation. ç
However,  his  power  is  limited  to implementing the decisions taken ç
by the Trustees/Members of the Governing Body, though he has the freedom ç
to act in matters of day-to-day administration. Theassistant secretaries ç
work under his guidance.
The individual centres of the Math are managed by the presidents and ç
of the Mission, by the secretaries, duly appointed by the Trustees/Members ç
of the Governing Body. These again, are expected to carry on their ç
work with the assistance of the monastic members allotted to their ç
centres as also volunteers and paid-workers.
The funds needed for running the various institutions are raised by ç
public donations and government grants wherever possible. Fees and ç
charges may also be collected from well-to-do persons, for the services ç
rendered, especially in educational and medical centres. Sale of religious ç
books and allied literature as<|>also various agricultural and rural ç
products may also be another source of income.
@SPACE = 
@SB = Spreading the Message
@SPACE = 
The main purpose of the Rama-krishna-Vivekananda Movement†as it is ç
designated today†is to spread the central message of R<193>mak<216><218><207>a-Vivek<193>nanda, ç
as expressed through the motto of the Rama-krishna Order.
Apart from its various centres which are relentlessly working towards ç
this goal, a large number of institutions have been started by the ç
devotees, friends and admirers of the Order on their own. These institutions ç
which are generally called `Private Centres', and are not legally ç
affiliated to the Headquarters of the order, are being run under the ç
guidance of the monks of the order, following the same pattern of ç
activities.
The process of legally bringing such centres under the general umbrella ç
of protection and policy of the Ramakrishna Math started in <MS>A.<|>D. ç
<D>1981 and is slowlybutsatisfactorily progressing. This umbrella ç
organisation has been named `<W1%-2>Ramakrishna-Vivekananda<D%0>-Bhavaprachara ç
Parishat' and is being formed in each of the States of India. This ç
has brought in greater cohesiveness in the working of such private ç
centres and also generated deeper faith in the minds of the public ç
who are assisting in their working.
Each of these centres, as a policy, is organising an annual conference ç
of all the devotees of that State. This is naturally bringing them ç
together and making them feel that they belong to one spiritual family.

@SPACE1 = 
@SPACE = 
The centres of the Ramakrishna Order in foreign lands fall into two ç
broad categories. Those countries where the social situation is similar ç
to that of Indialike Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Fiji or Mauritius, the ç
nature of service activities is also similar. In other countries, ç
especi-ally America, Canada and of Europe, the work is confined mostly ç
to the preaching of Ved<193>nta, publication of books and journals ç
and personal guidance in spiritual matters.
It is gratifying to note that persons of these western countries also ç
are showing a lot of interest in R<193>mak<216><218><207>a-Vivek<193>- ç
nanda Literature and are even opting for monastic life in the Order.
