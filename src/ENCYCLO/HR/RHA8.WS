She was married to the sage Jamadagni. She bore him five sons, of ç
whom Para·ur<193>ma was the youngest.
Once, suspecting her fidelity, Jamadagni asked his sons one by one, ç
to behead her. None obeyed him except Para·ur<193>ma who promptly ç
beheaded not only Re<207>uk<193> but also the elder brothers, as per ç
the command of his father. Pleased with his implicit obedience, Jamadagni ç

Re<207>uk<193>c<193>rya†also known by other names such as Reva<207>asiddha ç

the places dear to <185>iva or dedicated to <185>iva like K<193><210>c<200>pura ç

@SB = 1.	Introduction
@SPACE = 
The Veda is the original seed from which the huge banyan tree of Hinduism ç
has evolved. It has four aspects, of which the <184>gveda is the ç
first.
As per the hoary tradition, believed in by the Hindu orthodoxy, it ç
was the sage K<216><218><207>a-dvaip<193>yana who gathered all the ç
extant Vedic mantras of his times and divided theminto four groups, ç
thereby acquiring the honorific, `Vedavy<193>sa,' or `Vy<193>sa'. ç
This division was necessitated by the practical needs felt in the ç
performance of a sacrifice. All the mantras used by the priest hot<193> ç
(= `one who calls upon') to invite the various deities to a sacrifice, ç
were collected together and called the <184>gveda. Each of its mantras ç
is known as a `<216>c' or `<216>k'.
Being the most ancient and the basicwork, it has, naturally, influenced ç
the other three Vedas as also all their sub-divisions.

@SB = 2.	Date of the <184>gveda
@SPACE = 
The task of fixing a definite date or period for the <184>gveda†or, ç
for that matter, for any of the ancient Hindu scriptures†is as arduous ç
as mapping the movement of a bird after it has settled down in its ç

as follows:

However, most of these scholars have based their research findings ç
wholly or primarily on a few assumptions like the evolution of the ç
language of the <184>gveda, certain astronomical data (which may ç
not have been proved beyond all doubts), noticeable changes in socio-political ç
systems and so on. Hence none of these dates can be averred to be ç
true, beyond all reasonable doubts.
As for the orthodox traditions, the Vedas are not books, but a body ç
of knowledge revealed by the Creator at the beginning of each cycle ç
of creation.
Suffice it to say that a serious and devoted study of the Book is ç
more profitable than such dry polemical discussions which lead us ç
nowhere.
@SB = 3.	Methods of Division
Ancient Hindu tradition has divided the <184>gveda in two different ç
ways. The first is the A<218><219>aka Method and the second, the Ma<207><195>ala ç
Method. The former has been designed to facilitate easy memorisation, ç
by apportioning more or less equal number of mantras to each section. ç
In the latter method, the subject is more important.
The following tables give the details of both the methods:

The Vedic mantras used to be handed down by oral tradition. What the ç
teacher would chant, the student had to attentively listen and repeat. ç
Hence the Vedas have come to be known as `<185>ruti' (`what is heard') ç
also.
The Vedic <216><218>is (sages) had evolved a wonderful system of orally ç
teaching and learning these mantras* so that they could bepreserved ç
very correctly, especially the svaras or intonations, and transmitted ç
to the posterity. As a result, even today, we can come across pundits ç
who are capable of reciting the entire <184>gveda faultlessly!
@SB = 4.	<185><193>kh<193>s or Branches
Since the Vedic mantras were continually revealed to the great sages ç
in their mystical states and since they had to be kept in memory for ç
transmitting them orally to the next generation, a saturation point ç
was fast approaching, endangering the storing and transmission of ç
Vedic wisdom itself. Realising this, K<216><218><207>a-dvaip<193>yana ç
or Vedavy<193>sa divided the extant material into four groups and ç
taught them to his four chief disciples: Paila,   Vai·amp<193>yana,   Jaimini   and ç
Sumantu.
This was the first division of the Vedic mantras into four groups ç
that have come to be recognised as the, now well-known, four Vedas: ç
<184>gveda, Yajurveda, S<193>maveda and Atharvaveda.
However, since each of these four disciples had their own disciples ç
too, some minor alterations and readjustments had to be made by them ç
while teaching the Veda they had learnt from their teacher, Vedavy<193>sa. ç
This was done mostly by rearrangement of the mantras to suit their ç
local or ritualistic modes. Such modified forms came to be known as ç
·<193>kh<193>s.
Though the <184>gveda is said to have had 21 ·<193>kh<193>s, only ç
five have survived. They are: <185><193>kala, B<193><218>kala, °·val<193>yana, ç
<185><193><209>kh<193>yana and M<193><207><195><220>keya.
Obviously these have derived their nomenclatures from the sages of ç
those names such as <185><193>kala and B<193><218>kala.
These five ·<193>kh<193>s got further sub- divided by the same process. ç
The Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a (3.4.21, 22) declares that the <216><218>i ç
<185><193>kala created five more ·<193>kh<193>s and gave them to his ç
five disciples†Mudgala, G<193>lava, V<193>tsya, <185><193>l<200>ya ç
and <185>ai·ir<200>ya.
This process was adopted by the teachers of the other three Vedas ç
also.
@SB = 5.	Internal Divisions
Each of the four Vedas has again been subdivided internally into two ç
parts: Mantra and Br<193>hma<207>a.
More often, this division is raised to four, adding two more sections, ç
the °ra<207>yaka and the Upani<218>ad.
The Mantra section is more commonly called the Sa<221>hit<193>. In ç
fact, the very word `Veda' is used to indicate the Sa<221>hit<193> ç
part only. Thus, <184>gveda means the <184>gveda-sa<221>hit<193> ç
only, the other three being known by their special names.
The following are the names of these three sections of the <184>gveda ç
as available today:

@SB = 6.	<184><218>is or Sages
The word <216><218>i has been derived from the root <216><218> which ç
has two meanings: movement and knowledge.
When the sages were performing severe austerities to please ®·vara ç
or God and get spiritual wisdom, he appeared before them†this indicates ç
movement on his part†and gave that knowledge which they were seeking, ç
in the form of Vedic mantras. Hence they became `<216><218>is,' sages ç
to whom God Himself came and granted that knowledge.
According to the ancient Hindu tradi-tion, no Vedic mantra should ç
be recited without first uttering the name of the <216><218>i to whom ç
it was revealed, the chandas or the metre in which it is composed, ç
and the deity or god to whom it is addressed.
The number of the <216><218>is of the <184>gveda is very large. ç
There are nearly thirty women among them, such as Gho<218><193>, Godh<193>, ç
Vi·vav<193>r<193>, Ap<193>l<193>, Juh<220>, Saram<193>, Roma·<193> ç
and so on.
A <216><218>i need not always be the mantra- dra<218><219><193>, the ç
original seer of the mantra. Others also†such as the one who re- discovered ç
a mantra,one who expounded its meaning and significance, one who ç
used it first in a Vedic sacrifice and so on†may deserve that title.
The ancient commentators and compilers of subsidiary Vedic treatises ç
sometimes classify these <216><218>is into various groups. They are:
1)<+>·atarcins (those to whom a hundred <216>ks or more were revealed); ç
m<193>dhyamas (the middlings who got less <216>ks); k<218>udras<220>ktas ç
(propagators of small s<220>ktas); mah<193>s<220>ktas (propagators ç
of longer or bigger or more important s<220>ktas).
@SPACE1 = 
2)<+>mahar<218>is (the great <216><218>is); <216><218>is (sages of ç
second grade, mostly the sons of the mahar<218>is); <216><218><200>kas ç
(sons of the <216><218>is); ·rutar<218>is (famous <216><218>is).
Several kulas (va<221>·as or lineages) of Vedic <216><218>is have ç
been noted, especially in the pur<193><207>as. The originators of ç
these kulasare: Bh<216>gu, A<209>giras, Ka·yapa, Atri, Vasi<218><219>ha, ç
Vi·v<193>mitra, and Agastya.
Many great sages who became very well-known in later literature, were ç
the descendants of these seven. Some of them are: Jamadagni, Dadhya<209> ç
°tharva<207>a, Cyavana,  <184><218>abha,  V<193>madeva,  Garga, Raibhya, ç
Par<193>·ara, Vy<193>sa and Devar<193>ta.
@SB = 7.	Devat<193>s or Deities
As per the tradition of chanting the Vedic mantras†especially the ç
ones from the <184>gveda†a knowledge of the <216><218>i (sage), ç
the devat<193> (deity or god) and the chandas (metre), is absolutely ç
necessary.
Most of the s<220>ktas of the <184>gveda are hymns of prayer addressed ç
to the various deities.
These deities are generally enumerated as thirty-three: eight Vasus, ç
eleven Rudras, twelve °dityas, Indra and Praj<193>pati. Quite a few ç
other deities too find an important place. They are: Agni, A·vins, ç
Soma, S<220>rya, Varu<207>a, V<193>yu, Vi<218><207>u, Vi·vedevas and ç
Yama.
There are also several female deities like U<218>as, R<193>tri, V<193>c, ç
Sarasvat<200> and P<216>thv<200>.
It is interesting to note that many inanimate objects like grinding ç
stone, qualities like faith and emotions like anger have also been ç
deified and described.
Who are these devas or deities? Theyare conscious entities with their ç
ownindividualities having the powers to supervise certain aspects ç
of the various functions of the universe.
These devas are usually classified into three groups depending on ç
their areas of operation.
For instance the devas of p<216>thv<200> or earth are: Agni, P<216>thv<200> ç
and B<216>haspati.
Those operating in the antarik<218>a orintermediary space are: Indra, ç
V<193>yu, Parjanya, Rudra and the Maruts.
The devat<193>s stationed in the dyaus (heavenly region) are: Varu<207>a, ç
Mitra, Savit<216>, S<220>rya, P<220><218>an, °dityas, Vi·vedevas, ç
U<218>as and A·vin<200>devat<193>s.
There are statements in the <184>gveda itself that Truth (or God) ç
is one and all these devat<193>s are its various aspects (vide 1.164.46; ç
7.58.2; 10.114.5).
@SB = 8.	Literary Grace
The <184>gveda is not only the oldest scripture in the world, but ç
also literary masterpiece.
The entire work is in verses of various metres. Though the total number ç
of metres used is fifteen, only seven are more common. Of these again, ç
only three† tri<218><219>ubh, g<193>yatr<200> and jagat<200>†have ç
been used extensively.
The selection of appropriate words and the ease with which they have ç
been used are really admirable. Since large compound words have been ç
totally avoided, the verses are easy to comprehend.
Description of the physical beauty of the Maruts (5.54.11) and the ç
goddess U<218>as (1.92.4) is quite enchanting. Another verse on the ç
same goddess (1.92.10) also reveals her `cruel' nature since she `cuts ç
away' the lives of human beings even as the daughter of a hunter cuts ç
off the wingsof a captured bird so that it can fly no more!
The seven verses in the second ma<207><195>ala  (2.39.2-7)  describe  the  twin ç
deities, the °·vins, in great detail with several similes like two ç
great charioteers or two beautiful women (who are always together) ç
or the two wheels of a chariot. The prayer addressed to them is for ç
long life, strength and protection.
There are several Sa<221>v<193>das<220>ktas, s<220>ktas dealing ç
with the conversations between Pur<220>rava and <188>rva·<200> (10.95), ç
Yama and Yam<200> (10.10), Agastya and Lop<193>mudr<193> (1.179), ç
Vi·v<193>mitra and Nad<200>s (rivers, 3.33) as also Agni and the gods(10.51). ç
There is also an interesting soliloquy of a gambler unburdening his ç
piteous condition (10.34).
The   <188>rva·<200>-Pur<220>rava   sa<221>v<193>da reveals the deep ç
mutual love and attachment in a married couple.
The Yama-yam<200>-sa<221>v<193>da reflects the glory of mature spiritual ç
wisdom and its victory over carnal passions. The Agastya-Lop<193>mudr<193>-sa<221>v<193>da ç
depicts the duty ofa householder to have worthy offspring. In the ç
Vi·v<193>mitra-nad<200>-sa<221>v<193>da, Vi·v<193>mitra who is travelling ç
with the king Sud<193>sa and others prays to the river Vip<193><219> ç
and <185>utudr<200> (Beas and Sutlej) to make way by lessening their ç
flow. The rivers, being pleased with his prayer oblige him. In the ç
Agni-devat<193>-sa<221>v<193>da, the gods discover Agni hiding in ç
waters and pray to him to return, to take up once again his duties ç
of carrying the havis (oblations) to them.
@SPACE1 = 
There are also several other s<220>ktas wherein sentiments such as ç
heroism, or beauties of nature, or humility and devotion to God, or ç
war-scenes have been described. All these may be considered as precursors ç
to the later theories about the navarasas (nine sentiments) found ç
in the works now known as Ala<209>k<193>ra·<193>stra.
@SB = 9.	Commentaries
The Sanskrit language of the Vedas in general and of the <184>gveda ç
in particular, is highly archaic and arcane. Without the help of ancient ç
commentaries it is difficult to decipher them.
@EMERGENCY = The Nigha<207><219>u (a Vedic dictionary ofhoary antiquity) ç
and its commentary, (the Nirukta of Y<193>ska (800 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>), ç
are the earliest sources of interpretation of the Vedic names and ç
concepts.
It is of interest to note that even the Nirukta refers to some very ç
ancient schools of Vedic interpretation such as adhi- daivatapaddhati ç
(a system that recognises the presiding deity behind even physical ç
objects), <193>khy<193>na-samayapaddhati (enquiring into the historical ç
aspects and fixing periods of time, taking the <193>khy<193>nas or ç
stories as the basis), y<193>j<210>ikapaddhati (interpretation according ç
to the needs of a yaj<210>a or sacrifice), naid<193>napaddhati (attempts ç
to discover a basic or permanent meaning behind the Vedic words) and ç
vaiy<193>kara<207>apaddhati (the school of interpretation according ç
to grammar).
The earliest commentary on the <184>gveda available now is that ç
of Skanda-sv<193>mi (circa <MS>A.D.<D> 630). He belonged to the de·a ç
or the country Valabh<200>. His fatherwas Bhart<216>dhruva. His disciple ç
was Harisv<193>mi who has written a commentary on the <185>atapatha ç
Br<193>hma<207>a of the <185>ukla Yajurveda.
His commentary as available now is incomplete.
Ve<209>ka<219>am<193>dhava (11th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) is another ç
author whose commentary on the whole of the <184>gveda is available. ç
He belonged to the Kau·ikagotra (lineage) and was the son of Ve<209>ka<219><193>rya ç
and Sundar<200>. His commentary is very brief. It has been printed ç
also.
Madhv<193>c<193>rya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1238-1317), also known as °nandat<200>rtha, ç
has written anice commentary in verses on the first forty s<220>ktas ç
only. It is generally known as the <184>gbh<193><218>ya. Jayat<200>rtha ç
(14th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) has  written  a  gloss  on  it  called ç
Sambandhad<200>pik<193>.
This commentary of Madhv<193>c<193>rya deals with the mantras from ç
three different angles and tries to show that the entire Veda teaches ç
about N<193>r<193>ya<207>a.
@SPACE1 = 
The greatest of all the commentators on the <184>gveda is S<193>ya<207><193>c<193>rya ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1315-1387) who has the unique distinction of having ç
composed bh<193><218>yas or commentaries on all the four Vedas. He ç
was the second son of M<193>ya<207>a and <185>r<200>mat<200>, and ç
belonged to the Bh<193>radv<193>jagotra. The renowned monk Vidy<193>ra<207>ya ç
(the founder of the famous Vijayanagara empire) was his elder brother, ç
and Bhogan<193>tha (another great scholar) was the younger one.
All the three brothers had served the empire as prime-ministers and ç
ministers.
He has composed commentaries notonly on the Sa<221>hit<193>s of the ç
Vedas but also on the Br<193>hma<207>as and the °ra<207>yakas.
For a correct understanding of the Vedas a thorough knowledge of the ç
six Ved<193><209>gas  as also  the  P<220>rvam<200>m<193><221>s<193> ç
system based on the S<220>tras of Jaimini (along with the bh<193><218>ya ç
of <185>abarasv<193>min [circa 100 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>]) is absolutely necessary. ç
To be brought up in the samprad<193>ya (ancient and continuous tradition, ç
handed down from the guru to the disciple) is equally important. S<193>ya<207>a ç
had the advantage of both. Hence his commentaries should be considered ç
as the most authoritative in every sense of the term.
During the 18th and the 19th centuries, quite a few European scholars ç
like Bloomfield (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1855-1928), Grassman (<MS>A.D.<D> ç
1809-1877), Kaegi (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1849-1925), Keith (<MS>A.<|>D. <D>1879-1944), ç
Ludwig (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1832-1912),  Max  M<F20M>Å<F255D>ller  (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1823-1900), Macdonell (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1854-1930), Muir (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1810-1882), and Wilson (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1786-1860) have contributed ç
to Vedic studies. Out of these, the work of Max M<F20M>Å<F255D>ller who translated ç
and published the entire <184>gveda with S<193>ya<207>a's Commentary ç
in 6volumes, during the period 1849 to 1873, needs special mention. ç
The works of Bloomfield and Wilson as also of Macdonell and Keith ç
have been very useful to the students of Vedic studies.
However, the conclusions drawn by these European scholars are often ç
off themark, since they were not grounded in what the Hindus call, ç
`samprad<193>ya,' theall-important ancient tradition, transmitted ç
meticulously from generation to generation.
There are also enough grounds of suspicion to conclude that these ç
scholars were motivated more to prove the superi-ority of Christianity ç
over Hinduism thanto study, understand and interpret the Vedas.
@SB = 10.	Philosophy of the <184>gveda
The greatness of Hinduism, like the basic flow of a great river, lies ç
in the fact that its value system at the core has remained intact ç
in spite of centuries of vicissitudes, wrought about by external aggressions ç
or internal upheavals. If Ved<193>nta is the pinnacle of all the Hindu ç
philosophical systems, the <184>gveda is its mother-root. Almost ç
all the ideas found later, in the Upani<218>ads and allied scriptures, ç
are already there in the <184>gveda in a seed form, though not in ç
one place.
True it is that the <184>gveda praises several gods like Agni, Indra, ç
Maruts and others, the number of mantras devoted to Indra and Agni ç
being<|>the maximum. However, they are not, like the Greek gods, separate ç
and independent individuals in conflict with one another. That they ç
are all different aspects or facets of one and the same Supreme Being, ç
is also declared in several places (vide 1.164.46; 7.58.2; 10.114.5).
There is a clear reference to God the Supreme in several places even ç
though different appellations have been used. They are, for instance: ç
°tm<193> (= Self; 1.115.1), Ch<193>y<193> (=<|>light; 5.44.6); Deva ç
(=Being of light; 10.121); Hira<207>yagarbha (= Golden Egg; 10.221.1); ç
Ka (=Praj<193>pati; 10.121); Pit<193> (= Father; 10.81.1); Puru<218>a ç
(= Being; 10.90.2); Savit<193> (= Sun; Creator; 3.62.10); Tva<218><219><193> ç
(= one who shapes; 3.55.19); Vena (10.123); Vidh<193>t<193> (= Giver; ç
10.82.3); Vi·vakarm<193> (= Creator of the world; 10.82.2).
Also, Indra, Agni and Varu<207>a have often been praised as the Supreme ç
Lord.
@SPACE1 = 
That God alone existed before creation and that he is the creator, ç
protector and ruler of this world is clearly mentioned in several ç
mantras (10.221.1-4; 10.82.1-6; 10.129).
As regards the mode of creation, what is described in the three famous ç
s<220>ktas† the Hira<207>yagarbha-s<220>kta (10.221.1-4), the Puru<218>a-s<220>kta ç
(10.90) and the N<193>sad<200>ya-s<220>kta (10.129)†is almost the ç
same as the one found in the Upani<218>ads.
God, who alone existed before creation, is the creator, sustainer ç
and destroyer of the world. He does it as per his own free will. He ç
is both the up<193>d<193>na or the material cause and the nimitta ç
or the efficient cause. He is not only immanent in the world (because ç
he has created it out of himself), but also transcendent. Hence, he ç
himself is everything he has created (vide 10.81.1; 10.5.7; 10.82.1).
@SPACE1 = 
The <184>gveda also describes the several infinitely good and great ç
qualities of God like omnipotence <%-2>(3.59.1;<|>1.24.6),<%0> rulership<|>(8.93.11), ç
omniscience (6.51.2), transcendence (6.47.15), extraordinary brilliance ç
(8.81.51), having a cosmic form (1.13.10), being the inner controller ç
(1.67.34), incomparability (6.21.10) and so on. He is the greatest ç
friend and protector of his devotees (1.75.4; 6.7.7). He is very generous ç
and fulfils all their desires (10.80.1). He is supremely adorable ç
(2.35.12).
The question that is normally discussed in the Ved<193>nta system, ç
viz., the identity or otherwise of the j<200>va (individual soul) ç
withBrahman (God), is not raised or even mentioned in the <184>gveda. ç
However, the desire to attain the world of the immortal gods, expressed ç
in10.16, shows that these sages believed in an eternal soul and an ç
eternal world (Pit<216>loka, the world of manes; 10.14).
The aim of life is to attain God (6.31.4). What keeps the human beings ç
away from him is p<193>pa or sin, evil ways of living. Hence one should ç
pray to him for forgiveness (1.24.14), for being freed from sins and ç
be guided on the path of righteousness (8.45.34; 5.82.5).
The spiritual disciplines that lead the aspirants to him are: faith ç
in him as the only support of life (8.45.20); prayer to him for being ç
guided in the path of truth (10.133.6); prayer for spiritual wisdom ç
before old-age comes (1.71.10); prayer for serving the Lord always ç
(6.45.9); appeal for eternal protection (8.1.13; 8.61.17); devotion ç
as the best means (8.70.3); intense longing to see him (6.3.4).
The concept of mok<218>a or liberation as described in the Upani<218>ads ç
is not found here in that form. Breaking up of the physical body†after ç
death†and its being merged in the five elements (earth, water, fire, ç
air and ether) thereby freeing the j<200>va (soul) has been mentioned. ç
The deity Agni leads the j<200>va by the path of the gods to the world ç
of pit<216>s (manes) ruled by Yama, wherein he lives happily.
@SB = 11.	Society of the <184>gvedic Times
The society of those times, as seen through the eyes of the <184>gveda, ç
was a virile and dynamic society. Its basic spirit was <216>ta, the ç
cosmic law and order, reflected in social and personal life, which ç
gave rise to the later concept of dharma. This naturally made the ç
people forge a strong relationship with the Vedic gods like Indra, ç
Agni, Varu<207>a and others, especially through the religious system ç
of yaj<210>as, which was widely practised.
@SPACE1 = 
However, there is no evidence to assume that temples and image worship ç
as we have today, ever existed then. Based on one mantra (1.80.9) ç
some scholars are inclined to think that group prayers might have ç
existed.
The sages of the <184>gveda had realised the importance of life ç
here and now and that it afforded man a great opportunity for a glorious ç
life after death, if led properly. They never despised life. Hence ç
they prayed for a strong body, pure sense-organs and long life (1.8.98; ç
3.53.18; 2.21.6). At the same time they also recognised the importance ç
of moral and ethical values in personal and social life (9.73.1; 9.73.6; ç
8.31.13).
An important aspect of life in this world is earning wealth by right ç
means and sharing the good things of life with others, especially ç
the less fortunate ones, through d<193>na or giving gifts (5.24.2; ç
2.21.6; 3.14.6). In fact d<193>na was valued highly and hence hailed ç
profusely (10.107.2; 10.117.3,<|>4).
Marriage was considered as a sa<221>sk<193>ra or sacrament and a woman ç
had an honourable place in the family, not only as wife but also as ç
mother (10.85.27, 44). The Viv<193>has<220>kta (10.85) gives an ç
idea of the Vedic concept of marriage.
It appears that a woman, under certain circumstances, had the freedom ç
to choose her husband (10.27.12); and, a widow (probably childless) ç
could remarry, the groom being the younger brother of her husband ç
(10.40.2).
Even by the time of the <184>gveda, sahagamana (a widow dying on ç
the funeral pyre of her dead husband) had become a symbolical ritual.
Monogamy and polygamy were both common.
Father was the head of the family. Couples generally hankered for ç
male offsprings though daughters were not looked down upon.
@SPACE1 = 
Both cremation and burial existed as the modes of disposal of the ç
dead.
Other aspects of the life of the people may now be considered. The ç
Vedic society had attained a high degree of civilisation and culture, ç
contrary to the opinions expressed by the Western writers of the colonial ç
era.
People lived in villages and towns, often protected by forts (1.114.1; ç
7.3.7). Though agriculture and dairy farming were the main occupations, ç
other vocations like carpentry (9.112.1), smithy (9.112.2), medical ç
profession (9.112.1), weaving (6.9.2), building ships (10.101.2) and ç
leather work (7.63.1) were also practised.
Good methods of irrigation were known to the farmers (3.45.3; 7.49.2).
As regards food, clothing, jewels, decorative materials, weapons of ç
war, animals like cows, horses and elephants, quite a high standard ç
had been achieved. Drinking of the soma juice in sacrifices was highly ç
eulogised. Eating of meat was quite common. Music and dance were well- ç
known means of entertainment (10.18.3).
References to drinking wine and gambling, to thieves and robbers as ç
also a few diseases are also there, from which protection was sought, ç
from the gods.
Great kings and heroes, and also their valiant deeds, especially in ç
battles and wars, find mention in quite a few places.
The division of the society into thefour var<207>as†br<193>hma<207>as, ç
k<218>attriyas, vai·yas and ·<220>dras†had come to stay. The br<193>hma<207>as ç
wielded great influence on the whole society by their intellectual ç
and spiritual power.
@SPACE1 = 
On the whole it can be easily conceded that the <184>gvedic society ç
was in no way undeveloped or barbaric. On the other hand, it had attained ç
a high degree of civilisation and culture.
