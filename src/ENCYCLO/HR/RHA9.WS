@SB = 12.	Epilogue
The <184>gveda is not only the basic scripture of Hinduism, but ç
also an authentic†though brief, and often poetic†record of all aspects ç
of the life of the people of its times. It is not only a holy book ç
but also a holistic replica of the contemporary society.
@NT = <184>gvidh<193>na
The vidh<193>nas are a class of Vedic literature which describe the ç
ritualistic use of the Vedic mantras for securing the objects of desire ç
or fulfilling one's wishes.
The <184>gvidh<193>na of <185>aunaka (circa 500 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>) is ç
the earliest of such works. It is a metrical work composed in the ç
anu<218><219>ubh and the tri<218><219>ubh metres.
Apart from the <184>gvidh<193>na, <185>aunaka has been credited ç
with the authorship of nine more works, all the ten being collectively ç
called <185>aunakasm<216>ti. (See also <MS>ANUKRAMAØ®.<D>)
There are five adhy<193>yas or chapters, the last one, the smallest, ç
being the phala·ruti (eulogy of the work). The verses in the adhy<193>yas ç
are divided into vargas, of four or five verses each. There are, in ç
all, 744 verses, grouped into 139 vargas.
The various mantras of the <184>gveda are used mostly in Vedic sacrifices. ç
Very often, their meanings fit in well with the rites wherein they ç
are used.
However, in the <184>gvidh<193>na, these <216>ks or mantras are ç
employed for various purposes like magical rites or charms or for ç
effecting supernatural results. In this respect, this work is akin ç
to the tantra literature and hence may be considered as its precursor.
The contents of this work, may, very briefly, be summarised as follows:
Fourfold objects of desire, viz., <193>yus (longevity), svarga (heaven), ç
dravi<207>a (wealth), s<220>nu (son); various k<216>cchras orpenances ç
(See <MS>K<184>CCHRA.<D>); magical charms or rites for pacification, ç
prosperity, progeny, long life, heaven, wealth, destruction of sins ç
committed, freedom from diseases, destruction of enemies, securing ç
intelligence and supernormal vision and so on.
The methods prescribed include japa (repetition of Vedic mantras), ç
homa (offering oblations into duly consecrated fire), p<220>j<193> ç
(ritualistic worship of Vi<218><207>u), stotra (chanting of hymns), ç
tapas (austerities) and yoga (art of meditation).
A few samples of the use of the <216>ks may now be given:
For prosperity (1.66); pacification of planetary influences (2.62); ç
mental peace (3.45); long life (1.50.13); attaining heaven (1.84.16-18); ç
for getting wealth (3.53); for progeny (7.46); for graceful speech ç
(8.101.6); for knowledge (1.114).
The language of the work seems to be pre-P<193><207>inian.
Some of the earlier authorities quoted in the work are: <184><218>ya·<216><209>ga, ç
Ku·ika, N<193>rada, Manu and Vi<218><207>ukum<193>ra.

There is only one commentary on this work, the <184>gvidh<193>napadapa<210>cik<193>, ç
by one M<193>t<216>s<220>nu. That he was a native of Northern India ç
and had also composed a work on Ved<193>nta, Subodhapa<210>cik<193>, ç
is all that is known about him.
M<193>t<216>s<220>nu never fails to give the references to the Vedic ç
passages referred to in the text.

@NT = <216><207>a
@N1 = (`debt')
<184><207>as or debts are of two kinds: laukika (worldly) and alaukika ç
(otherworldly). (For the latter, see <MS><184>ØATRAYA.<D>)
When a person takes loans from others, he has to repay it as per the ç
contract. If he cannot, he should repay by working for the creditor ç
without taking any remuneration. If he dies without repaying it, his ç
son or grandson should do so on his behalf.
@NT = <216><207>atraya
@N1 = (`three debts')
The idea of <216><207>atraya, the three debts under which every human ç
being is born, has been hinted at, even in the <184>gveda (8.32.16; ç
6.61.1). However it is more explicit in the later Vedic literature ç
like the Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> (6.3.10.5) and the <185>atapatha ç
Br<193>hma<207>a (1.7.2.11).
These <216><207>as are: deva-<216><207>a (debt to gods); pit<216>-<216><207>a ç
(debt to the manes) and <216><218>i-<216><207>a (debt to the sages).
The first is repaid by the performance of yaj<210>as or Vedic sacrifices; ç
the second by begetting sons and doing ·r<193>ddhas or obsequial ceremonies, ç
and the third by sv<193>dhy<193>ya (study of the Vedas) and tapas ç
(practising austerities).
Deva-<216><207>a may be repaid by worship of gods, fasting and other ç
types of auste-rities also, if one is unable to perform yaj<210>as.
Sometimes two more <216><207>as are added, as follows: br<193>hma<207>a-<216><207>a ç
(repaid by giving gifts to br<193>hma<207>as since they perform many ç
religious rites for us); <193>tma-<216><207>a (debt to the j<200>v<193>tman, ç
repaid by taking care of the body-mind complex properly).
The Mah<193>bh<193>rata (°diparva 120. 17-20) mentions an interesting ç
aspect of debt, <193>n<216>·a<221>sya (not being cruel to other living ç
beings), since we can live here only by the goodwill of others.

@NT = Rohi<207><200>
Rohi<207><200> was the first wife of Vasudeva and the mother of Balar<193>ma, ç
elder brother of K<216><218><207>a. In their earlier life they were ç
Suras<193> and Ka·yapa. They were reborn due to a curse of the god ç
Varu<207>a.
Rohi<207><200> was also the name of a cow†a daughter of K<193>madhenu, ç
the celestial cow†who gave birth to all the cows of the world.
One of the twenty-seven daughters of Dak<218>a married to Candra (Moon), ç
Rohi<207><200> was his dearest wife.
As a nak<218>atra or star-constellation (the 4th in the list of 27) ç
Rohi<207><200> comprises the stars alpha, theta, gamma, delta and ç
epsilon Tauri.
In Hindu astrology, it is an auspicious star suitable for the performance ç
of caula (first haircut for a male child), upanayana (investiture ç
with the sacred thread), viv<193>ha (marriage) and so on.

Romap<193>da†also known as Lomap<193>da †was a king of Candrava<221>·a ç
or lunar dynasty. He was a good friend of Da·aratha, the king of Ayodhy<193>. ç
He is said to have adopted <185><193>nt<193>, the daughter of Da·aratha ç
as his daughter and later, married her to the sage <184><218>ya·<216><209>ga.
Once there was a terrible famine in his kingdom. He then managed to ç
bring the sage to his capital. As soon as the sage entered his kingdom ç
there was heavy rain (vide R<193>m<193>ya<207>a 1.9.11; Bh<193>gavata ç
9.23).

<184><218>abha was the son of king N<193>bhi and queen Merudev<200>.
He was a great king. He had a hundred sons from his queen Jayant<200>. ç
He made over the kingdom to Bharata, his eldest son, and retired to ç
the forest to perform austerities in the <193>·rama (hermi-tage) of ç
the sage Pulaha.
The mountain peak on which he did austerities was called <184><218>abhak<220><219>a. ç
Due to his curse†since he did not want any noise to disturb him†the ç
whole place became lonely and silent.
He gained many yogic powers by his tapas (austerity). After attaining ç
the goal of his life, he gave up his body in the forest fire.

@NT = <216><218>i
@N1 = (`a man of wisdom)
@SPACE = 
Derived from the verbal root <216><218> (`to know'), the word <216><218>i ç
means any person who has attained expertise and proficiency in any ç
field of knowledge. Hence, a <216><218>i need not be a person of religious, ç
philosophical or spiritual bent of mind. In this sense, an expert ç
in any field of knowledge, like Caraka, Su·ruta or Bh<193>skar<193>c<193>rya, ç
can be called a <216><218>i.
However, in a more restricted sense, only a person of spiritual wisdom, ç
who has transcended sa<221>s<193>ra or transmigratory existence, can ç
be termed a <216><218>i. Being a man of perfect chastity, with tremendous ç
self-control and deeply devoted to truth, he is also capable of blessing ç
the good and cursing the wicked.
<184><218>is could have been born in all castes and classes, because ç
they attained that state by dint of their self-effort.
@SPACE1 = 
The general belief is that the number of <216><218>is may be around ç
48,000!
Sometimes, the <216><218>is are classified into several groups. For ç
instance, the group of seven famous sages is known as Saptar<218>is. ç
The Saptar<218>is of the present age are: Vi·v<193>mitra,  Jamadagni,  Bharadv<193>ja, ç
Gautama, Atri, Vasi<218><219>ha and Ka·yapa.
Another mode of classification is: devar<218>i, brahmar<218>i, r<193>jar<218>i, ç
mahar<218>i, paramar<218>i, ·rutar<218>i and k<193><207><195>ar<218>i.
A sage honoured even by the devas or gods is a devar<218>i. One who ç
has realised Brahman or is an expert in the Vedas is a brahmar<218>i. ç
A r<193>ja or a king who has attained high spiritual states is a r<193>jar<218>i. ç
A mahar<218>i is one who is considered as very great. Paramar<218>i ç
is one who has realised Param<193>tman or God. A ·rutar<218>i is one ç
about whom many have heard, i.e., who is famous. A sage to whom a ç
k<193><207><195>a or a section of the Veda has been revealed, is a ç
k<193><207><195>ar<218>i.
Apart from the saptar<218>is mentioned earlier, the following are ç
a few of the several great <216><218>is mentioned in the Hindu scriptures: ç
N<193>rada, Ka<207>va, Garga, V<193>lm<200>ki, Vy<193>sa, <185>uka, ç
Agastya, V<193>madeva, A<218><219><193>vakra, Bh<216>gu, Loma·a, Durv<193>sas, ç
Dhaumya, Sanaka, M<193>rka<207><195>eya and Maudgalya.
@NT = <216><218>ik<193>
@N1 = (`a woman <216><218>i or sage')
The word <216><218>i means a person of intuitive knowledge and wisdom, ç
especially a seer of Vedic hymn. Contrary to the general notion, a ç
<216><218>i need not be a man only. There are as many as 27 <216><218>is ç
mentioned in the <184>gveda itself who were women (vide B<216>haddevat<193> ç
2.82-84).
These 27 <216><218>is, called <216><218>ik<193>s, have been classified ç
into three groups of nine persons each.
The <216><218>ik<193>s of the first group are: Gho<218><193>, Godh<193>, ç
Vi·vav<193>r<193>, Ap<193>l<193>, Upani<218>at, Ni<218>at, Brahmaj<193>y<193>-juh<193>, ç
Agastyasvas<193> and Aditi.
The following are the <216><218>ik<193>s of the second group: Indr<193><207><200>, ç
Indram<193>t<193>, Saram<193>, Roma·<193>, Urva·<200>, Lop<193>mudr<193>, ç
Nadya<199> (= river deities), Yam<200> and <185><193>·vat<200>.
The third group comprises the following nine who have been specially ç
designated as Brahmav<193>din<200>s: <185>r<200><199>, L<193>k<218><193>, ç
S<193>rpar<193>j<210><200>, V<193>k, <185>raddh<193>, Medh<193>, Dak<218>i<207><193>, ç
R<193>tr<200>, and S<220>ry<193>s<193>vitr<200>.
The <216><218>ik<193>s of the first group have just sung hymns of ç
praise of the gods. The second group <216><218>ik<193>s have conversed ç
with prominent <216><218>is (sages) and gods. The <216><218>ik<193>s ç
of the third group have identified themselves with the deities and ç
hence have praised themselves through the hymns. Thus they are not ç
only the <216><218>is but also the devat<193>s (deities to whom the ç
prayer is addressed.
@NT = <184><218>ipa<210>cam<200>-vrata
The <184><218>ipa<210>cam<200>-vrata is dedicated to honouring the ç
Saptar<218>is or the seven sages who are highly revered figures in ç
our tradition. They are Ka·yapa, Atri, Bhara-dv<193>ja, Vi·v<193>mitra, ç
Gotama, Jamadagni and Vasi<218><219>ha. (According to another tradi-tion, ç
they are: Mar<200>ci, Atri, A<209>giras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and ç
Vasi<218><219>ha.) They have laid us under a deep debt by revealing ç
spiritual knowledge and wisdom through the Vedic mantras.
The vrata can be performed by men of all the var<207>as (for all practical ç
purposes, castes). Worship can be offered to the images of the sages. ç
Subsisting on vegetables and observing celibacy are very important ç
in this vrata. Freedom from sins and troubles and increase of good ç
fortune are the promised results. Women observing this vrata are promised ç
good bodily form, beauty, happiness and pro-geny. It may be observed ç
for seven years (i.e. seven <184><218>ipa<210>cam<200>s consecutively). ç
The seven images along with the seven kala·as should be donated to ç
seven br<193>hma<207>as.
Though meant for all, it has somehow become a vrata observed mostly ç
by women.

If strange are the stories given in the Hindu epics and the pur<193><207>as, ç
stranger still are the powers of the people mentioned there.
One such was the great sage <184><218>ya·<216><209>ga. He was the ç
son of the sage Vibh<193><207><195>aka and had two horns like those ç
of a deer!
Once, the king Romap<193>da of A<209>gade·a displeased the br<193>hma<207>as ç
of his country who migrated en masse to other countries. Consequently ç
there were no rains in A<209>gade·a and a severe famine set in. On ç
the advice of some wise elders, he managed to bring <184><218>ya·<216><209>ga ç
to his country. As soon as the great sage stepped on the soil of A<209>gade·a, ç
it rained heavily and the people were saved of starvation.
Romap<193>da gave his foster daughter <185><193>nt<193> (considered ç
as the daughter of Da·aratha and adopted by Romap<193>da) in marriage ç
to the young sage to show his gratitude.
<184><218>ya·<216><209>ga was the chief priest who conducted the Putrak<193>me<218><219>i ç
sacrifice for Da·aratha.
The present town of <185><216><209>ger<200> in Karnataka State, is ç
said to be the placewhere <184><218>ya·<216><209>ga had his hermitage. ç
According to another version it was on the bank of the river Kosi ç
in the Bhagalpur district of Bihar.
<184><218>ya·<216><209>ga is also the name of a writer of dharma·<193>stra ç
quoted by a few well-known works like the Mit<193>k<218>ar<193> ç
and Sm<216>ticandrik<193>. However, his work has not been obtained ç

The Yogas<220>tras of Pata<210>jali (200 <MS>B.C.<D>) is the most ç
systematic and basic work of Hindu psychology which deals with the ç
characteristics of a healthy or even a supernormal mind.
While dealing with sam<193>dhi or the superconscious state of mind, ç
Pata<210>jali has used this word `<216>tambharapraj<210><193>' (1.48).
When the mind of the yogi (one whois practising meditation as per ç
the directions given by Pata<210>jali) is rid of the impurities of ç
rajas and tamas, it learns to flow unhindered, culminating in the ç
experience of the puru<218>a or the <193>tman (the Self).
When such a mind is directed towards any object, it can give a direct ç
and clear knowledge of that object untainted and unhindered. Hence ç
it is called <216>tambhara-praj<210><193> (a knowledge that is full ç
of the true nature of that object). The sam<193>dhi state in which ç
this occurs is called `dharmamegha-sam<193>dhi'.

<184>tu means a season. The twelve months of the year are divided ç
into six <216>tus: vasanta (spring), gr<200><218>ma (summer), var<218>a ç

@N1 = (`the terrible')
Rudra is a Vedic deity. He has been eulogised in only three s<220>ktas ç
of the <184>gveda out of which two are more explicit (1.114.1-11; ç
2.33.1-15). His name appears 75 times. He is also called `<185>iva' ç
18 times.
The various definitions of the word Rudra are: one who roars or thunders; ç
one who makes his enemies weep; one who destroys the sa<221>s<193>ra ç
(transmigratory existence)  of  his  devotees;  one  who destroys ç
aj<210><193>na or nescience.
Rudra's beauteous form has been described in various mantras. He is ç
strong with powerful arms. He has a long ja<219><193> or hair. He ç
is very handsome. His bodydecorated with many ornaments of gold, ç
especially a matchless necklace, is brilliant. He is holding a vajr<193>yudha ç
(thunderbolt) as also a strong bow and arrows.
When necessary he can also assume a fierce form. Riding in a chariot, ç
he charges at our enemies if only we pray to him.
Rudra is also full of mercy and a great protector of his votaries.
Being closely associated with forests and mountains, he is also the ç
king of medicines and hence a healer of all diseases.
When supplicated, he destroys sins and grants happiness.
The Rudrapra·na of the Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> (4.5) gives ç
a long and beautiful description of Rudra.
The  <185>vet<193>·vatara  Upani<218>ad  (3.2) describes him as ç
the creator and ruler of the universe.
The Mah<193>bh<193>rata (Anu·<193>sanaparva ch. 14) as also quite ç
a few pur<193><207>as declare Rudra as that form of <185>iva who destroys ç
the universe at the end of a cycle of creation.
In Vedic literature, sometimes eleven Rudras are mentioned. They may ç
be minor deities representing the ten pr<193><207>as (vital- airs) ç
and the mind (See <MS><185>IVA<D> for details.)
In later literature (vide Padma-pur<193><207>a, Svargakha<207><195>a, ç
ch. 8), eight names of Rudra are mentioned, which are actually the ç
eight aspects of Rudra-<185>iva.
All the Rudras have their female counterparts or consorts like Rudr<193><207><200> ç
(Rudra), Bhav<193>n<200> (Bhava), <185>arv<193><207><200> (<185>arva), ç
<185>iv<193>n<200> (<185>iva), Mah<193>dev<200> (Mah<193>deva) and ç
so on.
The eight Rudras or eleven Rudras, when considered as aspects of Rudra-<185>iva, ç
are described in detail, along with their garments and weapons, in ç
iconographical works  like  R<220>pama<207><195>ana  and  Vi·va- ç
karma·ilpa.
Rudra is also regarded as having created bh<220>tas (demons), pretas ç
(disembodied spirits), pi·<193>cakas (goblins) and k<220><218>m<193><207><195>as ç

upon Mah<193>deva and to that meditation may Rudra impel us'.]
The mantra previous to this (1.22) is also, sometimes, called by the ç
same name since the second and the third lines of this are similar ç
to the Rudrag<193>yatr<200>.
This mantra also, like the other g<193>yatr<200>mantras, is used for ç
meditation and japa.
The  Prapa<210>cas<193>ratantra  (27.41) attributed to <185>a<209>kar<193>c<193>rya ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 788-820) gives a dhy<193>na·loka (verse describing ç
the form of the deity for meditation) beginning with the words `bibhrad-dorbhi<199>' ç
and ending with `kalottu<209>gamauli<199>' for this Rudra-g<193>yatr<200>. ç
It describes Rudra as holding an axe and a deer in two hands and the ç
other two showing the abhaya and thevarada mudr<193>s (handposes ç
expressing protection and granting boons). He is sitting on a lotus, ç
wearing the tiger-skin. His body is well-decorated. He has five faces ç
(each with three eyes) and is shining like a mountain of precious ç
stones.
@NT = Rudrag<200>t<193>
@EMERGENCY = The Bhagavadg<200>t<193>, the finest jewel among  the  secondary  scriptures  of ç
Hinduism†generally called the sm<216>tis† has been responsible, though ç
indirectly, for the appearance of several g<200>t<193>s in the later ç
religious literature.
@EMERGENCY = The  Rudrag<200>t<193>  is  one  of  the minor g<200>t<193>s ç
that occur in the Bh<193>gavata (4.24.33-79).
Pr<193>c<200>nabarhi was a great king. He had ten sons, all of whom ç
were known as Pracetas. He commanded them to beget worthy sons after ç
performing severe austerities. As they were proceeding, searching ç
for a suitable place, they saw Rudra, the great god, emerging out ç
of a vast and beautiful lake.
@EMERGENCY = The Pracetas then went towards him and offered their ç
obeisance with great devotion. Pleased with this, god Rudra taught ç
them a wonderful hymn by which they were advised to pray to Bhagav<193>n ç
V<193>sudeva.
@EMERGENCY = It is this part comprising 47 ·lokas or verses that has ç
come to be known as the Rudrag<200>t<193>.
@EMERGENCY = The following is a brief summary of the same:
Victory unto the Supreme Lord who protects the knowers of the <193>tman ç
(the Self). He is everything and everybody. He is the creator and ç
controller of the world. He manifests himself through the four vy<220>has ç
or emanations. (See <MS>VY<188>HAS.<D>) It is he who is in the form ç
of the deity Soma (the food of gods), the lord of yaj<210>as (sacrifices) ç
as also the Vir<193><219>puru<218>a (Cosmic Being). He, it is, who ç
is karma (action) as well as its fruits. He is Rudra as also Brahm<193>. ç
He is the origin of speech.
O Lord! Grant us the vision of your extremely elegant form.
(The next eight verses [45-52] give a highly poetical description ç
of the well-known K<216><218><207>a-V<193>sudeva form to facilitate ç
meditation.)
One who wants to purify himself should meditate on this form.
He is easy of attainment for those who are deeply devoted to him.
One who has succeeded in pleasing him does not desire for anything ç
else. None, including Yama (the god of death), can exercise any control ç
over such a devotee. The company of such devotees is far superior ç
even to svarga (heaven) or mok<218>a (liberation).
Hence none should waste his time and life, but worship him, the origin ç
of the world as also its destroyer as k<193>la or time.
Anyone who sings or chants this Rudrag<200>t<193>, especially in ç
the early hours of morning, will be liberated from all bonds.
@NT = rudr<193>k<218>a
@N1 = (`Rudra's eye')
The rudr<193>k<218>a is the berry of the tree or the shrub Elaeocarpus ç
ganitrus, used to prepare <185>aiva rosaries.
When Rudra (<185>iva) performed austerities for a thousand years with ç
open eyes the tears that rolled out of his eyes (= ak<218>i) fell ç
on the earth and grew into fine trees producing these berries. Hence ç
the name rudr<193>k<218>a (or rudr<193>k<218>i).
It is well-known that Rudra/<185>iva has three eyes. From the eye ç
representing S<220>rya<|>or the sun, 12 varieties of rudr<193>k<218>as, ç
dark-brown in colour, were produced. From the second eye representing ç
Candra or the moon, 16 varieties of white rudr<193>k<218>as were created. ç
From the third eye representing Agni or the fire, 10 varieties of ç
dark rudr<193>k<218>as were evolved.
Thus 38 varieties of rudr<193>k<218>as are stated to be in existence.
As regards the wearing of the rudr<193>k<218>as (strung with a cotton ç
or silk thread) on the body, different colours arerecommended for ç
different var<207>as as follows:
@NID = <+>white ones for br<193>hma<207>as;
@NID = <+>red or brown ones for k<218>attriyas;
@NID = <+>yellow or mixed coloured ones for vai·yas;
@NID = <+>and, dark or black ones for the ·<220>dras.
@SPACE1 = 
A rudr<193>k<218>a bead may be of different sizes†big, medium or small.
Also, its mukhas or faces may vary from one to fourteen. wearing of ç
the different varieties on the body is said to produce different results.
For instance, wearing a necklace of rudr<193>k<218>as with one mukha ç
or six mukhas can free a person from the sin of brahmahaty<193> (killing ç
of a br<193>hma<207>a); of ten mukhas, can get rid of the trouble ç
created by evil spirits; of twelve mukhas, can vouchsafe freedom from ç
diseases and enemies and so on.
Performing japa (repetition of the divine name) with a rosary of rudr<193>k<218>as ç
duly consecrated is considered extremely auspicious. However, one ç
should not wear this on the body.
Rudr<193>k<218>as strung with cotton or silk thread can be worn on ç
different parts of the body, like the two arms, wrists, on the tuft ç
of hair, in the neck, in the ears and on the chest. The number of ç
beads on each has also been specified.

@NT = Rudr<193>k<218>a J<193>b<193>la Upani<218>ad
@EMERGENCY = This is a minor Upani<218>ad assigned to the S<193>maveda. ç
There are 49 sections comprising  anu<218><219>ubh  verses  as  also ç
passages in prose.
@EMERGENCY = It is in the form of a long dialogue between K<193>l<193>gni-rudra ç
and sages like Bhusu<207><195>a, Sanatkum<193>ra, Ja<195>abharata, ç
Datt<193>treya,  K<193>ty<193>yana,  Vasi<218><219>ha  and others. ç
The topics dealt with may be summarised briefly as follows: (the numbers ç
in the brackets indicate the verses or sections.)
Origin of rudr<193>k<218>a trees and beads (1-5); results of wearing ç
the beads or doing japa with them (6 and 7); varieties of the rudr<193>k<218>a ç
beads (8-16); methods of wearing the beads on the various parts of ç
the bodyalong with the appropriate mantras (17-25); rudr<193>k<218>as ç
with one to fourteen faces and the results of wearing them (26-42); ç
things to be given up or avoided by one who wears the beads (43); ç
eulogy of wearing rudr<193>k<218>a on various occasions (44,45); greatness ç
of rudr<193>k<218>a (46-48); eulogy of studying this Upani<218>ad ç
(49).
@EMERGENCY = The Upani<218>ad makes a special mention that one who ç
wears the rudr<193>k<218>as must avoid eating meat, onion and garlic; ç
nor should he consume liquor.
@EMERGENCY = Another point stressed is that even if one does not wear ç
it always, he can wear it on special days like eclipses, during the ç
ayanas or equinoxes and sa<209>kr<193>ntis (passage of the sun into ç
the next zodiacal sign), full-moon and new-moon days.

@NT = Rudrapra·na
The Rudrapra·na is the fifth pra·na (section) of the fourth k<193><207><195>a ç
(chapter) of the Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> or the K<216><218><207>a ç
Yajurveda. It is also known as the Rudra or the Rudr<193>dhy<193>ya ç
or the Namaka. It has eleven anuv<193>kas or long stanzas.
God Rudra, as his very name indicates, is a terrible deity, armed ç
with a bow, arrows and a sword. If he is pacified with appropriate ç
prayers, he will shower his mercy on the supplicant and fulfil his ç
desires. This is the gist of the first anuv<193>ka.
The next eight anuv<193>kas (2 to 9) describe the various forms and ç
aspects of Rudra, along with an obeisance (nama<199>) attached to ç
each of the names. (Hence the name Namaka.)
Some of these aspects are: Hira<207>ya-b<193>hu (golden-armed); Babhlu·a ç
(seated on the bull Nandi); Harike·a (with dark hair); Sthapati (master); ç
Niceru (one who moves constantly); A·vapati (leader of monks); G<216>tsapati ç
(leader of intelligent persons); Bhava  (origin  of  all  beings);  Rudra ç
(remover of all miseries); <185>arva (destroyer of sins); Pa·upati ç
(lord of beings bound in sa<221>s<193>ra), Sahasr<193>k<218>a (one ç
with a thousand eyes); M<200><195>hu<218><219>ama (giver of rains); ç
Sa<221>v<216>dhvan (glorious one); Agriya (primeval being); °·u (all-pervading); ç
<185>lokya (established in Vedic mantras); Dh<216><218><207>u (adept ç
in protecting); V<193>stavya (one who resides in wealth); Soma (one ç
who is with his consort Um<193>); T<193>mra (who is red like the rising ç
sun); Hant<216> (destroyer of enemies); T<193>ra (one who helps the ç
j<200>vas to transcend sa<221>s<193>ra); <185>ambhu, <185>a<209>kara ç
(producer of happiness); <185>iva (the auspicious one); T<200>rthya ç
(purifier); Kapardin (one with matted hair).
@SPACE1 = 
The tenth anuv<193>ka is a long prayer asking for the following boons: ç
freedom from misery and fear for all the members of the family and ç
the livestock; a life of happiness for all, both in this world and ç
in the next; withdrawal of (his) fierce form and granting a vision ç
of (his) benign form; urging one's organ of speech to praise Rudra.
The  last†the  eleventh†anuv<193>ka describes the innumerable forms ç
that Rudra takes, and obeisance is offered.
Before starting a Vedic sacrifice, a vedi or a platform of bricks ç
had to be built. After keeping the last brick in place, it used to ç
be bathed in milk†called `abhi<218>eka'†with the mantras of this Rudrapra·na.
There is a time-honoured tradition that the Rudra or Namaka and ç
Camaka (Taittir<200>ya Sa<221>hit<193> 4.7) are to be chanted ç
daily along with the Puru<218>as<220>kta.
There are several methods of chanting the Rudrapra·na (and Camaka) ç
ceremonially. One such method prescribed by the sage <185><193>t<193>tapa ç
is as follows:
a) Rudra: Chant the Namaka (Rudra) once, followed by the first ç
anuv<193>ka of Camaka. This is repeated a second time and so on, ç
each time adding the next anuv<193>ka of the camaka, the total chanting ç
being eleven times. This is called a `Rudra'.
b) Rudraik<193>da·in<200>: If eleven persons chant the Rudra (as ç
stated above) eleven times or one person recites it 121 times, it ç
becomes `Rudraik<193>da·in<200>'.
c)<+>Mah<193>rudra: This is achieved if eleven persons recite the ç
Rudra eleven times a day for eleven days.
@SPACE1 = 
Alternatively, if 121 persons chant it eleven times or 1331 persons ç
chant it once, in a day, it becomes `Mah<193>rudra'.
d) Atirudra: If eleven persons chant it 11 times per day for 121 ç
days, it becomes `Atirudra'.
The same will be the result if 1331 persons chant it eleven times ç
in a day (just for one day), or, 114,641 persons recite it once, in ç
a day.
Generally, Mah<193>rudra and Atirudra are performed to ward off calamities ç
for the society or the country.

@NT = Rudrapray<193>ga
@SPACE1 = 
There are plenty of places of pilgrimage in the lower and upper regions ç
of the Him<193>layan ranges. Rudrapray<193>ga is one of them. It is ç
in the Tehri-Garhwal district of Uttaranchal.
It is situated at the confluence of the rivers Alakanand<193> and ç
Mand<193>kin<200>, the tributaries of Ga<209>g<193>. It is in the ç
middle of the route that leads to Badar<200>n<193>tha and Ked<193>ran<193>tha. ç
In fact, it is from here that the two roads get separated.
There is a nice temple of Rudran<193>tha-<185>iva here, at the place ç
where the sage N<193>rada is stated to have performed severe austerities ç
to please him. <185>iva is said to have given him a thorough knowledge ç
of the science and art of music.
The place is 135 kms. (84 miles) from the well-known pilgrim centre ç
H<216><218><200>ke·a (Rishikesh).

@NT = Rudray<193>mala
@SPACE1 = 
The y<193>malas are a group of t<193>ntrik literature. (See <MS>TANTRAS.<D>) ç
They represent the secret dialogues between a deity and his spouse ç
(y<193>mala = pair).
Out of the eight y<193>malas, the Rudray<193>mala is the third.
The printed texts contain 66 chapters and 6000 verses, mostly in the ç
anu<218><219>ubh metre, though the references to this workin treatises ç
like the Dhanad<193>pura-·cara<207>a-vidhi, put the number at 1,25,000 ç
verses.
It praises the Atharvaveda profusely.
Apart from dealing with the mysterious Ku<207><195>alin<200> and the ç
yogic practices connected with it, quite a few elements of the v<193>m<193>c<193>ra ç
schools like the pa<210>camak<193>ras also find a prominent place.
In this work the guru's place is supreme.

@NT = Rukm<193><209>gada
Great devotees of God have often been subjected to severe tests. But, ç
by the very grace of God Himself, they have also come out successful. ç
King Rukm<193><209>gada is one such glorious example.
An ardent devotee of Vi<218><207>u, the king Rukm<193><209>gada was ç
fastidious in the observance of ek<193>da·<200> (eleventh day after ç
full- moon or new-moon) as a vrata (religious vow) consisting of total ç
fasting and worship of God Vi<218><207>u.
Once, as ill-luck would have it, he fell in love with a beautiful ç
woman, Mohin<200> by name, promising her to do whatever she wanted.
On an ek<193>da·<200> day when Rukm<193><209>-gada was fasting, she ç
demanded that either he should break his fast or kill his son Dharm<193><209>gada ç
(son of the chief queen Sandhy<193>val<200>). Rukm<193><209>gada was ç
not willing to do the first and was hesitant to do the second, when ç
his son voluntarily offered to sacrifice himself. Just as he was about ç
to behead his son, Vi<218><207>u appeared on the scene and took away ç
the whole family to Vaiku<207><219>ha, his celestial abode.
Mohin<200> had been specially sent by Brahm<193>, the creator, to ç
subject the king Rukm<193><209>gada to this test.
The  ek<193>da·<200>  day  on  which  this happened is observed even ç
today as Vaiku<207><219>ha Ek<193>da·<200> (eleventh day of the bright ç
fortnight in the month of M<193>rga·ira, usually in December).
@NT = Rukmi<207><200>
Whenever  God  Vi<218><207>u  incarnated himself on this earth, his ç
consort Lak<218>m<200> too would do so as his spouse. In his incarnation ç
as K<216><218><207>a, Lak<218>m<200> came down as Rukmi<207><200>.
Rukmi<207><200> was the daughter of Bh<200><218>maka, the king of ç
Vidarbha. Though she wanted to marry K<216><218><207>a only, her elder ç
brother Rukmi was opposing it vehemently. So she sent a secret message ç
through a trusted br<193>hma<207>a to K<216><218><207>a, who successfully ç
managed to abduct her and later marry her.
Pradyumna was her son and C<193>rumat<200>, her daughter.
She immolated herself in a fire after the demise of K<216><218><207>a.

R<220>pagosv<193>m<200>, his elder brother San<193>tanagosv<193>m<200> ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1481-1558) and J<200>vagosv<193>m<200> (d. <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1609) were the three jewels of Bengal Vai<218><207>avism, a movement ç
started by <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a Caitanya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1486-1533) ç
on devotion to K<216><218><207>a as the sole means of redemption.
Hailing from South India, he and San<193>tanagosv<193>m<200> went ç
to Bengal and were working as very high state officials under Hussain ç
Sh<193>h, the then ruler of Bengal. They were called Dab<200>r Kh<193>s ç
and S<193>kar Mallik. Whether these terms meant the designations of ç
the positions they occupied or that they had become Muslims with these ç
names, is not clear.
When <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a Caitanya, about whom the brothers ç
had heard much andhad been completely fascinated by him, visited ç
them, they renounced the world and became his ardent disciples. They ç
then went to and settled down at V<216>nd<193>ban (now in Uttar Pradesh) ç
as per his directions.
R<220>pagosv<193>m<200> was a great scholar and has left 31 treatises ç
on bhakti or devotion. Out of them the following works may be considered ç
as more important: Bhaktiras<193>m<216>tasindhu, Lalitam<193>dhava, ç
Ujjvala-n<200>lama<207>i and Vidagdham<193>dhava.
