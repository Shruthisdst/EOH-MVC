@NID = R<193>va<207>a in the courtroom of his palace, admonished him ç
severely and advised himto return S<200>t<193> honourably to R<193>ma ç
or be prepared to face decimation at his hands. Due to R<193>va<207>a's ç
wrath, when Hanum<193>n's tail was set on fire by his aides, the v<193>nara ç
hero destroyed the cityby that very fire. He then triumphantly returned ç
to R<193>ma and Sugr<200>va who immediately started on an invasion ç
of La<209>k<193>.
During the war, Hanum<193>n's heroic exploits were many. Even the ç
mighty R<193>va<207>a could not stand the intensity of his blows!
After the death of R<193>va<207>a at the hands of R<193>ma and the ç
formal coronation of Vibh<200><218>a<207>a as the king of La<209>k<193>, ç
S<200>t<193> had to be given the good tidings. This privilege was ç
naturally conferred on Hanum<193>n who did it so successfully and ç
gracefully that S<200>t<193> was all praise for him. Out of his intensity ç
of devotion to S<200>t<193> and his sensitivity to her intolerable ç
suffering under the r<193>k<218>as<200>s (demonesses) Hanum<193>n ç
offered to punish them severely. The offer, however, was rejected ç
outright by S<200>t<193>, the compassionate mother of all.
Along with Vibh<200><218>a<207>a and Sugr<200>va, Hanum<193>n also ç
went to Ayodhy<193> to attend the coronation ceremony of R<193>ma. ç
When the Pu<218>paka-vim<193>na, the divine aircraft, alighted in ç
the hermitage of the sage Bharadv<193>ja, it was again Hanum<193>n's ç
prerogative to act as the messenger of R<193>ma to Bharata, then living ç
at Nandi-gr<193>ma. In this he endeared himself to Bharata almost ç
instantaneously.
@SPACE1 = 
After the coronation, R<193>ma gave a priceless necklace to S<200>t<193> ç
giving her the freedom to grant it to anyone she deemed fit. Again, ç
it was none other than Hanum<193>n who received the gift.
Since Hanum<193>n decided to stay back in this world as long as R<193>ma's ç
legendary story was recited and listened to, R<193>ma blessed him ç
before he left for his heavenly abode.
Though coming from the Ki<218>kindh<193> culture, considered to be ç
a little lower than that of Ayodhy<193>, Hanum<193>n standsas the ç
brightest example of human excellence.
@S10 = VIBH®<186>AØA
Vibh<200><218>a<207>a is one of the dazzling gems not only among the ç
r<193>k<218>asas but also among the other votaries of R<193>ma. Bh<200><218>ma ç
and Dro<207>a of the Mah<193>bh<193>rata, though they knew that ç
Duryodhana was morally wrong in usurping the kingdom of the P<193><207><195>avas, ç
ultimately sided with him. True, they advised him and even admonished ç
him. But, to them, obligation to a person  became  more  important  than ç
commitment to dharma! Vidura was a little better. He not only severely ç
admonished Duryodhana and his tribe but also stayed away from participating ç
in the iniquitous war. But Vibh<200><218>a<207>a of the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
made history by deserting the camp of the wicked and fighting against ç
it from the camp of the good and the noble. No doubt he had an ambition ç
for becoming the king of La<209>k<193> as R<193>ma himself has admitted. ç
But, coming from the royal race, he could not abdicate his claim to ç
the throne and responsibility to the kingdom since it involved saving ç
La<209>k<193> ultimately, from ignominy.
Being s<193>ttvika by nature, goodness and devotion to dharma were ç
natural to him. Even when he practised severe austerities along with ç
R<193>va<207>a and Kumbhakar<207>a,  and  Brahm<193>  appeared before ç
him to bless him, he asked only for his mind being firmly established ç
in dharma! Brahm<193>, pleased with him, granted him the additional ç
boon of being immortal even here.
<185>urpa<207>akh<193> too and later on R<193>va<207>a himself, concede ç
his righteousness and goodness.
In R<193>va<207>a's caucus of sycophants he was the first to boldly ç
declare R<193>va<207>a's abduction of S<200>t<193> as utterly wrong ç
and sinful and to exhort him in various ways to send her back to R<193>ma ç
with all honourdue to her and to R<193>ma. In this battle for righteousness ç
he had many an encounter with R<193>va<207>a's aids and even with ç
Indrajit, his own young nephew. Yet, he successfully stuck to his ç
guns and silenced them all.
But for the utter humiliation and insult heaped upon him by R<193>va<207>a ç
in his insolence, Vibh<200><218>a<207>a might have continued to live ç
in La<209>k<193>, persevering in his efforts to bring back sanity ç
into his behaviour. But that was not to be.
When he finally decided to cross over to R<193>ma's side, he never ç
hesitated, since he knew in his heart of hearts, that R<193>ma would ç
neither punish him nor desert him. His innate faith in R<193>ma's ç
greatness and nobility was his forte.
The first thing that R<193>ma did was to symbolically crown him as ç
the monarch of La<209>k<193>. This automatically enhanced Vibh<200><218>a<207>a's ç
faith in him.
@SPACE1 = 
Since Vibh<200><218>a<207>a's surrender and R<193>ma's acceptance ç
were both complete and perfect, Vibh<200><218>a<207>a spared no effort ç
in helping R<193>ma to overcome all the obstacles created by the r<193>k<218>asas, ç
especially the ones centred in m<193>y<193> or delusory powers. His ç
help to R<193>ma, particularly during the beheading of the M<193>y<193>-S<200>t<193> ç
(illusory S<200>t<193>) was timely and invaluable.
After R<193>va<207>a's death, Vibh<200><218>a<207>a at first refused ç
to perform the last rites for him. Being admonished by R<193>ma and ç
realizing his duty, he completed it as per the dictates of the scriptures. ç
The lifelong bonds of brotherly affection then made him break down ç
with sorrow and lamentation. However, he quickly overcame the same ç
and regained his usual composure.
He too attended R<193>ma's coronation at Ayodhy<193>, enjoying his ç
loving hospitality.
When R<193>ma finally departed from this world, he commanded Vibh<200><218>a<207>a ç
to return to his kingdom and rule over his subjects by dharma. Vibh<200><218>a<207>a ç
was not allowed to open his mouth and protest, because La<209>k<193> ç
needed his benign rule!
@S10 = R°VAØA
Even the strongest of chains breaks at its weakest link with little ç
effort. Even the mightiest of men gets liquidated by his own mortal ç
sins. R<193>va<207>a the `loka-r<193>va<207>a,' who `shook the worlds' ç
once, is the supreme example of this eternal principle. He had great ç
physical strength, was handsome and stately in appearance, possessed ç
vast knowledge of the Vedas and was an expert in the use of weapons ç
and in waging wars.
However, his uncontrollable lust, as also his arrogance, brought about ç
his utter ruination.
Endowed with natural strength and prowess, and boosted further by ç
the boons he had secured from Brahm<193>, the creator, he was a terror ç
to the whole world. There was no warrior whom he had not vanquished ç
or killed, no sage whom he had not humiliated, no woman whom he had ç
not molested during his nefarious invasions and victory marches. He ç
was shrewd enough to forge friendly ties with those who were a match ç
to him so that his evil deeds could go on unhindered. K<193>rtav<200>rya ç
and V<193>li belonged to this category.
But neither mercury nor sin can be digested that easily! The tears ç
of the chaste women and the anguished cries of the holy hermits along ç
with their curses weighed heavily upon him, finally bringing him down.
S<200>t<193> proved to be his nemesis. From the day she was brought ç
to La<209>k<193>, its fate was sealed. Odious omens started to appear ç
in abundance foreboding evil to the whole society and its king. Not ç
only Vibh<200><218>a<207>a, even the trusted lieutenants of R<193>va<207>a, ç
had noticed them with dismay and had warned him of the impending disaster ç
if the remedial measure of returning S<200>t<193> was not implemented ç
immediately.
But the die had been cast. Being a prisoner of inordinate lust and ç
an aggressive ego, R<193>va<207>a could never get out of his self-created ç
and self-nurtured predicament.
@SPACE1 = 
He never hesitated to sacrifice the lives of his trusted generals, ç
his near and dear relatives, even his own brother and sons, for bolstering ç
his position. The very fact that he got Kumbhakar<207>a woken up before ç
the allotted period of six months, even though he knew well that, ç
that would mean his sure death, is proof enough for this.
In his fight against R<193>ma and his army, R<193>va<207>a employed ç
every means, fair or foul, to defeat or destroy the enemies. When ç
nothing worked and his own forces were steadily getting decimated, ç
R<193>va<207>a realized that he was now paying through his nose, for ç
all his sins and misdeeds. But it was too late. In desperation he ç
even tried to behead the poor S<200>t<193>, since she was `responsible' ç
for all his ills! Timely intervention by the saner elements around ç
him saved her life.
R<193>va<207>a had been worsted in his battle against R<193>ma earlier, ç
who had mercifully let him off the hook. But, when the final battle ç
ensued, there was no escaping. He fought bravely and bitterly, but ç
was brought down by the infallible missile (Brahm<193>stra) bearing ç
the name of the very person who had endowed him with many boons and ç
powers!
R<193>va<207>a stands today as the supreme example of the tragedy ç
that can strike anyone who misuses and abuses his talents and powers, ç
against the good and the noble, against the innocent and the holy.
@S10 = KUMBHAKARØA
Endowed with a mountainous body and an appetite of astronomical magnitude, ç
Kumbhakar<207>a possessed a simple heart and an intellect tempered ç
with a sense of justice. When his very existence in the waking state†he ç
used to eat up the living beings by scores at a time to satisfy his ç
ravenous appetite†became a disaster for the world, the gods successfully ç
worked out a stratagem with the assistance of Sarasvat<200> (the goddess ç
of speech) and the concurrence of Brahm<193>, the Creator, to put ç
him to sleep most of the time. He would wake up once, that too just ç
for a day, after a sleeping bout of six months. This saved the lives ç
of millions of beings and salvaged the honour of the Creator himself.
Kumbhakar<207>a was present in the second advisory council called ç
by R<193>va<207>a. He boldly admonished him and even gave a discourse ç
on the duties of a king! However, his own nature soon overtook this ç
streak of wisdom in him and he promised R<193>va<207>a to `set right' ç
everything by his own prowess. He then went to sleep.
Within nine days after this, tragedy after tragedy struck R<193>va<207>a ç
and he lost a good number of his sons and generals. So, he was obliged ç
to wake up Kumbha-kar<207>a from his phenomenal sleep, even though ç
he knew of its disastrous consequences, since rousing Kumbhakar<207>a ç
half way through his sleep would mean his certain death.
This time also Kumbhakar<207>a was amazingly frank and gave the same ç
advice. R<193>va<207>a frowned upon him. Seeing that he was in no ç
mood to listen to words of sanity and wisdom, Kumbhakar<207>a confessed ç
to having given that advice as a matter of duty but agreed to do his ç
bidding. R<193>va<207>a, of course, commanded him to fight.
Kumbhakar<207>a landed on the battlefield  like  an  avalanche  and  started ç
destroying the v<193>naras by catching them and eating them up. He ç
almost succeeded in  capturing  Sugr<200>va  but  the  latter managed  to  escape  after  successfully ç
amputating his earlobes and nose bridge.
@SPACE1 = 
As he was rushing towards R<193>ma, Vibh<200><218>a<207>a accosted ç
him. Kumbhakar<207>a's heart melted out of love and compassion for ç
him and advised him to make himself scarce lest he might be killed. ç
Kumbha-kar<207>a however appreciated and approved Vibh<200><218>a<207>a's ç
decision to join R<193>ma and blessed that the r<193>k<218>asa race ç
be saved by him.
Kumbhakar<207>a was finally mowed down by the powerful arrows of R<193>ma.
Verily, he strikes us more like a tragic hero. By siding with the ç
unrighteous conduct of his elder brother, though out of brotherly ç
love, he sacrificed himself. It was, however, in vain.
@S10 = V°LI
V<193>li was the son of <184>k<218>arajas, born by the grace of Indra. ç
Sugr<200>va was his younger brother. He was the king of Ki<218>kindh<193>.
He was extremely strong and had even routed R<193>va<207>a once when ç
he had dared to battle with him. 
V<193>li had been blessed by Indra with a golden necklace that would ç
add not only grace but also strength to him.
Though V<193>li and Sugr<200>va lived together in peace and harmony ç
with mutual love and affection, fate brought about a deep chasm between ç
them which persisted primarily due to V<193>li's intransigent and ç
vengeful nature.
Once V<193>li, accompanied by Sugr<200>va, went in hot pursuit after ç
a demon M<193>y<193>vi by name who had challenged him. When the enemy ç
entered a cave, V<193>li kept Sugr<200>va at the entrance as guard ç
and went inside. He did not return even after a long time. When blood ç
flowed out of the cave, and Sugr<200>va heard the noises of the r<193>k<218>asas, ç
he apprehended that V<193>li might have died. To prevent them from ç
escaping, Sugr<200>va blocked the mouth of the cave with a boulder ç
and returned to Ki<218>kindh<193> with great sorrow. The ministers ç
crowned him as the king. Sometime later, V<193>li returned after killing ç
M<193>y<193>vi and was furious to see Sugr<200>va on the throne. Though ç
Sugr<200>va surrendered and explained what had happened†that it was ç
a genuine case of misunderstanding†the suspicious and vindictive V<193>li ç
ruthlessly drove him out. He also usurped Rum<193>, Sugr<200>va's ç
wife, in spite of the pleadings and the sensible advice of T<193>r<193>, ç
his own queen. He thus incurred a great sin equivalent to incest, ç
for which he had to pay with his life at the hands of R<193>ma.
While accusing R<193>ma for having killed him in this manner he had ç
said that he himself could have recovered S<200>t<193> for him. R<193>ma ç
who knew better, had chosen Sugr<200>va as his ally rather than V<193>li, ç
because the former was a dharm<193>tma, a righteous person and the ç
latter was not. V<193>li being lewd by nature and a committed friend ç
of R<193>va<207>a, the consequences for R<193>ma would not have been ç
very pleasant.
Either due to R<193>ma's greatness or due to a streak of goodness ç
in V<193>li's own personality, V<193>li realized his mistake, accepted ç
R<193>ma's explanation, asked for his forgiveness and died a peaceful ç
death.
@S10 = S®T°
S<200>t<193>, the immaculate, the ideal of Indian womanhood for ages, ç
was the adopted daughter of S<200>radhvaja-Janaka, `Janaka' being ç
the surname of the family. She was found by him in the ground while ç
ploughing it, as a part of sacrificial rites. Hence she was also called ç
Bh<220>mij<193> or the daughter of Mother Earth. Keeping her divine ç
origin in mind, Janaka had pledged to give her in marriage only to ç
him who would string the <185>ivadhanus (the great bow of Lord <185>iva) ç
that was in the possession of his family. Many a warrior-prince had ç
tried his handat it but none had succeeded. R<193>ma did. And, the ç
marriage was performed with due <F20W1>Ç<F255D>clat. S<200>t<193> lived happily ç
with R<193>ma for quite a few years in Ayodhy<193>.
When R<193>ma gave up the kingdom, chose to retire to the forest, ç
S<200>t<193> automatically followed him. That was how she had been ç
trained by her parents in her svadharma.
@SPACE1 = 
S<200>t<193> was an ideal match for R<193>ma whether in physical beauty ç
or education and culture or wisdom or steady faithfulness. Though ç
she was obedient and ever ready to serve him, she freely expressed ç
her opinion†what she thought was right† when the occasion demanded. ç
When R<193>ma gave word to the sages of Da<207><195>aka forest that ç
he would destroy the demons of the forest, she protested gently saying ç
that the demons had done him no harm and reminded him that he had ç
come tothe forest like a hermit! However, when R<193>ma replied to ç
her objections she accepted the same gracefully.
The appearance of the golden deer at Pa<210>cava<219><200> was a turning ç
point in her and in R<193>ma's life. The extraordinary beauty of the ç
golden deer was so enchanting that she fell a prey to it in spite ç
of the timely warning given by the shrewd Lak<218>ma<207>a. Though ç
R<193>ma too was carried away by its beauty, he was more eager to ç
satisfy the desire of S<200>t<193> who had sacrificed everything for ç
his sake and had never asked for a thing. The consequences were of ç
course disastrous. When S<200>t<193> heard the distressed voice of ç
`M<193>r<200>ca-R<193>ma,' she was so unnerved†as women under such ç
situations do†that she goaded Lak<218>ma<207>a to go to R<193>ma's ç
rescue. But, Lak<218>ma<207>a the wise one, did not want to stir out, ç
leaving her unprotected. Then she openly accused him of the vilest ç
of intentions, and even threatened to commit suicide if he did not ç
go! Poor Lak<218>ma<207>a chose the lesser evil and departed. All ç
the same he did not escape from severe admonition by R<193>ma.
When R<193>va<207>a appeared on the scene in the guise of a monk, ç
she, in her innocence, treated him with all the respect due to a monk. ç
When he made his intentions known and then abducted her, she was shocked. ç
She then realized her fatal mistake and repented for having accused ç
and taunted Lak<218>ma<207>a. But it was too late!
While being carried away and when she noticed some persons sitting ç
on a hill, she had the presence of mind to drop some of her ornaments ç
amidst them. This, later on, helped R<193>ma and Sugr<200>va to locate ç
the abductor's place.
@SPACE1 = 
While in R<193>va<207>a's captivity she lived a very austere life. ç
She ruthlessly spurned all his advances and treated him like straw. ç
She was bold enough to advise him on dharma and forcefully suggest ç
that she be returned to R<193>ma with due honour. She even threatened ç
to burn him up by the very power of her chastity but held herself ç
since she did not have R<193>ma's permission, nor did she want R<193>ma's ç
prowess to go waste.
Her mind, all the while, was dwelling on R<193>ma and R<193>ma alone.
Once Hanum<193>n appeared on the scene and she got the news of R<193>ma, ç
her spirits got buoyed up.
Her refusal to go with Hanum<193>n back to R<193>ma, bespeaks volumes ç
of her sense of honour and propriety.
Her prayer to Agni, the fire-god, to protect Hanum<193>n when his ç
tail had been set on fire, and her refusal to permit Hanum<193>n to ç
punish the wicked r<193>k<218>as<200>s reveals her motherly love and ç
compassion.
After R<193>ma killed R<193>va<207>a and crowned Vibh<200><218>a<207>a ç
as the king of La<207>k<193>, S<200>t<193> was brought to R<193>ma ç
at his bidding. But when R<193>ma spoke very harshly and disparagingly, ç
she gave a spirited reply and chose to die by entering into fire rather ç
than suffer ignominy. No sooner did she enter the fire, than she was ç
brought out unscathed, endowed with even greater beauty and grace, ç
by Agni himself. After this fire-ordeal, when R<193>ma accepted her, ç
her joy knew no bounds.
@SPACE1 = 
Following the coronation of R<193>ma sheenjoyed peace and bliss. ç
However, when R<193>ma banished her to the forest even though she ç
was pregnant†being shaken by the insinuations of the people of Ayodhy<193>†she ç
took it in its stride, appreciating  R<193>ma's  standpoint  and reaction.
The sage V<193>lm<200>ki who sheltered her and nurtured her children, ç
was eager to reunite her with R<193>ma. However, R<193>ma's insistence ç
on her proving her purity once again in public, brought the curtain ç
down on her life once for all. She gracefully chose to leave the world ç
rather than face the humiliation of proving her innocence and purity, ç
time and again. But, even in her final moments, her only concern was ç
R<193>ma, her lord.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = KAUSALY°
@SPACE = 
V<193>lm<200>ki does not give any information about Kausaly<193>'s ç
antecedents. Though she was the chief queen of Da·aratha, he had ignored ç
her, due to his infatuation with Kaikey<200> and the fear of incurring ç
her wrath. Having been deprived of his love, she lived more like a ç
recluse or a nun, sustaining herself on the meagre funds granted to ç
her. She used to spend a substantial part of this on the maintenance ç
of Vedic students in a part of her palace. She was often harassed ç
by the servants and others of Kaikey<200>'s household.
On hearing that R<193>ma would be coronated as Yuvar<193>ja, she started ç
ceremonial worship and giving gifts in a big way. When R<193>ma broke ç
the tragic news, she was naturally affected like any mother. Her great ç
disappointment made her speak very harsh words to Da·aratha wounding ç
him deeply. However, his remorse and pitiable remarks begging for ç
pardon, madeher retract and apologize. She even remonstrated with ç
R<193>ma saying that as his mother, her command†`Do not go to the ç
forest!'†should get precedence over his father's! When R<193>ma gave ç
convincing reasons  she  accepted  the  same  and cooperated.
On the arrival of Bharata who was eager to make amends for all the ç
havoc perpetrated by his mother, she spoke harshly at first, wounding ç
his tender heart further. But, when she discovered his magnanimity, ç
she immediately responded and treated him with the same affection ç
that she showered on R<193>ma.
How she greeted R<193>ma, when he returned to Ayodhy<193>, can better ç
be guessed than described.
She was a simple woman with a golden heart who suffered much in life ç
but maintained her nobility and dignity throughout.
@S10 = SUMITR°
Sumitr<193>, the second wife of Da·aratha, was superior even to Kausaly<193> ç
in her equanimity, nobility and recognition of the divinity of R<193>ma. ç
She did not weep and wail when Lak<218>ma<207>a decided to accompany ç
R<193>ma to the forest. On the other hand she profusely blessed him, ç
advising him to treat R<193>ma and S<200>t<193> as his parents Da·aratha ç
and Sumitr<193>. If Kausaly<193>, even Sit<193>, found occasions to ç
vent their bitterness against Kaikey<200>, it was Sumitr<193> alone ç
who never did it. She bore all the hardships and ignominies, created ç
by Kaikey<200>'s jealousies, with stoic heroism. That is why Da·aratha ç
called her as `tapasvin<200>,' a hermitess. She solidly stood by Kausaly<193>, ç
giving solace and comfort by her timely advice. By her words and deeds, ç
she stands out as a remarkable woman.
@S10 = KAIKEY®
Kaikey<200> presents herself to us as an enigmatic personality. However, ç
piecing together all the information we can gather about her, we can ç
solve the riddle to a great extent.
She was the daughter of a woman† the queen of A·vapati, of Kekaya ç
kingdom †who had been banished by her husband for her ill-humored ç
nature. She had inherited her mother's temperament, who had not cared ç
even for the life of her husband! If physical beauty had equipped ç
Kaikey<200> with the power to ensnare Da·aratha, her impetuous nature ç
had made it worse. All the persons in the palace, as also Vasi<218><219>ha ç
the royal preceptor, Sumantra the chief minister and Siddh<193>rtha ç
(another minister), knew it and had taken her to task severely on ç
various occasions. Even Bharata did not have many kind words to spare ç
for her!
Bharata and <185>atrughna seem to have lived with A·vapati most of ç
the time. This loss of the company of her dear son had, perhaps, been ç
compensated by her by immersing herself in the pleasures of the palace ç
and harassing her co-wives.
One thing however was certain: She loved R<193>ma as she loved Bharata ç
and was all praise for his noble qualities. Whether she too had a ç
better side in her personality or whether R<193>ma's sterling qualities ç
could penetrate even her irascibility is left to one's discretion ç
to judge.
@SPACE1 = 
But for the Manthar<193> factor, her reaction on hearing the news ç
of R<193>ma's prospective coronation might have been pleasant. It ç
was Manthar<193> who stoked the fires of her innate jealousy towards ç
Kausaly<193>, the chief queen, which ultimately developed into a conflagration ç
resulting in all the havoc.
Da·aratha loved her intensely. But his love and attachment for R<193>ma ç
were even more intense. Had he not been trapped by his own words and ç
the boons he had granted earlier, he might have dismissed her demands ç
and even disowned her unceremoniously. All his entreaties and piteous ç
lamentations had no effect on her. Any woman, and a favoured wife ç
at that, would not have been that bad. Extremely harsh accusations ç
or harsher invectives, even by Sumantra and Vasi<218><219>ha, fell ç
on deaf ears.
All that she did, was for her dear son Bharata. But she had not, obviously, ç
expected his adverse reactions. When Bharata too joined the chorus ç
of criticism against her and decided to bring back R<193>ma, she must ç
have repented for her hasty actions.
She was also one of the persons in the forefront, to greet and welcome ç
R<193>ma, on his triumphant return.
She is a good example of persons spoiled by indiscriminate pampering ç
by the loved ones.
@S10 = <185>ABAR®
<185>abar<200> is the only character in the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
which is `small' but `beautiful!' She stands as the supreme example ç
of a person attaining beatitude by devotion andsurrender to the guru ç
or spiritual preceptor.
Her real name is not known. The word `<185>abar<200>' just indicates ç
that she was a woman belonging to the ·abara caste. <185>abaras were ç
a forest tribe, classed among the ·<220>dras and living by selling ç
honey and fruits gathered in the forest.
She had a guru, Mata<209>ga by name. He was a very great person, a ç
knower of dharma, who had practised severe austerities. He was perhaps ç
the same sage who had cursed V<193>li for his evil deeds. <185>abar<200> ç
was living in his hermitage as per his command given at the time of ç
his departure from this world. Having directed her to wait until R<193>ma ç
and Lak<218>ma<207>a came there and then leave the world after worshiping ç
them, he himself had cast off the body in his Vedic fire. She too ç
did the same thing after honouring R<193>ma to her heart's content.
There is a popular (mistaken) notion that <185>abar<200> gave R<193>ma ç
fruits after tasting them, thereby implying that she gave ucchi<218><219>a ç
(food or eatable soiled by one's saliva) to him. There is absolutely ç
no basis for this belief either in the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a or in ç
the allied works. As per the descriptions given by V<193>lm<200>ki, ç
she knew the manners and etiquette (yath<193>vidhi) of honouring guests. ç
R<193>ma's questions posed to her touch upon her austerities only.
Once the purpose of her long wait was over by meeting R<193>ma and ç
worshipping his feet and honouring him by giving the fruits she had ç
gathered, she expressed her blessedness and bliss.
It should specially be noted that the caste factor<+>never came in ç
the way of her honouring R<193>ma or R<193>ma responding to her service ç
or her attaining liberation.
@S10 = T°R°
T<193>r<193>, the queen of V<193>li and the mother of A<209>gada, ç
is the only woman character of Ki<218>kindh<193> about whom V<193>lm<200>ki ç
has given some details. She was the daughter of Su<218>e<207>a, a ç
v<193>nara hero.
T<193>r<193> was very beautiful and was also very intelligent, a combination ç
not always very common. She was also good in the art of talking wisely ç
and logically, with proper regard to time, place, person and situation.
When Sugr<200>va challenged V<193>li a second time, T<193>r<193> appealed ç
to V<193>li, not only not to fight with him†since he had secured the ç
friendship and protection of the extraordinarily powerful R<193>ma†but ç
to bring him back and make him the Yuvar<193>ja and live in peace ç
with him. However, her sensible counsel was not relished by V<193>li ç
as he was being driven by his inordinate hatred towards Sugr<200>va ç
and his own super-ego.
When V<193>li was mortally wounded, she was inconsolably griefstricken. ç
Words of advice by Hanum<193>n and of consolation by R<193>ma brought ç
her back to normal state.
When Sugr<200>va took over Ki<218>kindh<193> as the new king, T<193>r<193> ç
also became his wife as per the custom prevalent among the v<193>naras.
When an infuriated Lak<218>ma<207>a sent by R<193>ma entered Sugr<200>va's ç
palace, it was again T<193>r<193> who spoke very sweetly and pacified ç
him.
When R<193>ma was crowned as the king, T<193>r<193> also attended ç
the coronation ceremony along with Sugr<200>va and other v<193>nara ç
heroes as also their womenfolk.
@S10 = MANDODAR®
Mandodar<200> (also spelt as Ma<207><195>odar<200>), the chief queen ç
of R<193>va<207>a, was the daughter of Maya, the ·ilpi or architect ç
of the r<193>k<218>asas and the most brilliant exponent of the science ç
of architecture now known as Mayamata. She bore R<193>va<207>a  a  heroic  son†Meghan<193>da  or ç
Indrajit. She was so beautiful and resembled S<200>t<193> in so many ç
ways that Hanum<193>n mistook her at first, when he saw her in R<193>va<207>a's ç
harem, for S<200>t<193> herself. She knewthe evil nature of R<193>va<207>a, ç
and in all probability, had tried her bestto bring him to better ç
ways of life. Her lamentation at the death of R<193>va<207>a, over ç
his dead body described in a long passage, brings out her character ç
brilliantly. She could easily intuit that R<193>ma was none other ç
than Vi<218><207>u and S<200>t<193> was Lak<218>m<200>, his divine ç
spouse. She regrets that R<193>va<207>a by his evil deeds such as ç
destruction of the sacrifices of the <216><218>is, upsetting thewheel ç
of dharma, employing dubious methods  in  warfare  and  molesting ç
numberless women of all classes brought about his own ruin since the ç
consequences of sins can never be escaped.
By her dignity and sagacity she stands out as a rare exception among ç
the women of the r<193>k<218>asa race even as Vibh<200><218>a<207>a ç
does among the men of the same race.
@SB = 8.	Civilization and Culture as<R>ç
	Depicted in the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a
Civilization and culture need not, or, do not, always go together. ç
Advancement of civilization does not necessarily contri-bute to a ç
refinement of culture. Civilization makes our life here and now, more ç
easy, more comfortable. But, culture inspires us to use the good things ç
of life that civilization keeps in our hands, in the best interest ç
of all and in a way that brings long-term benefits. Civilization can, ç
like the weeds that grow along with the crops, contribute to profanity ç
too. Culture, on the other hand, with its stress on the moral and ç
ethical values, and a holistic approach to life, can not only tone ç
down its evil effects, but also elevate it to more sublime levels.
The R<193>m<193>ya<207>a of V<193>lm<200>ki mirrors both these aspects ç
of life. It presents us with three typical and distinct civilizations ç
and cultures: those of Ayodhy<193>, La<209>k<193> and Ki<218>kindh<193>.
The description of Ayodhy<193>, first under Da·aratha and later under ç
R<193>ma gives us an idea of its advanced civilization and culture. ç
The city was full of palatial buildings elegantly decorated. The roads ç
were well laid-out, broad, and kept clean by periodical watering. ç
There were strong and well-designed forts filled with all the articles ç
essential for the guards and their assistants. Armed forces were ever ç
kept in combat-readiness. They contained many heroes who were experts ç
in the use of weapons, especially in archery. However, they were magnanimous ç
in battles and followed the rules of dharmayuddha, like not attacking ç
an unarmed enemy or one fleeing from the battlefield. People led a ç
happy, peaceful and contented life. Study and propagation of the Vedas ç
as also theperformance of sacrifices went on unhindered.
@SPACE1 = 
The king administered the country very efficiently, ably assisted ç
by the ministers, advisors, and sages who acted as royal priests. ç
Satya and dharma (truth and righteousness) were the basic principles ç
upon which the whole edifice of the State rested. The duties of the ç
four var<207>as and the four <193>·ramas were scrupulously kept up ç
and were also enforced if and when necessary. Da·aratha being bound ç
by the word he had given to Kaikey<200>, R<193>ma's immediate compliance ç
by renouncing the throne and going to the forest, S<200>t<193> and ç
Lak<218>ma<207>a following him of theirown accord, Bharata's exemplary ç
behaviour in trying to bring back R<193>ma, Vasi<218><219>ha's ever ç
watchful eye in protecting the interests of the kingdom and its subjects†all ç
these bespeak of a highly cultured society.
La<209>k<193> under R<193>va<207>a was a very rich and prosperous ç
city of dazzling splendour. But almost all its riches were the result ç
of robbery or booty plundered in wars. The city abound in palaces ç
and huge buildings, as also gardens. The citizens were physically ç
giants with fierce appearance and ruthless behaviour. Drinking as ç
also cannibalism was quite common. There were also y<193>ga·<193>l<193>s ç
(sacrificial sheds), but the br<193>hma<207>as were devoted to magical ç
rites and sorcerous rituals. The temples were mostly dedicated to ç
certain fierce deities  like  Bhadrak<193>l<200>.  R<193>va<207>a  and ç
Indrajit were wont to worship this deity at a secret place called ç
Nikumbhil<193>, before a war, to acquire supernormal powers and weapons. ç
Hence they were experts in m<193>y<193>yuddha, wars using the magical ç
powers of illusion to deceive the enemies. Enjoyment of sensual pleasures ç
was the main concern of the people.
The city of Ki<218>kindh<193> has been described as a guh<193> or ç
a cave. It was probably situated within a mountain range, the passage ç
to which lay through a cave. The city itself was quite spacious, well-designed ç
and beautiful, provided with all the necessities for a comfortable ç
life, revealing an advanced civilization.
@SPACE1 = 
V<193>lm<200>ki has described the denizens of Ki<218>kindh<193> as ç
`v<193>naras' or monkeys with all the characteristic features of the ç
monkeys or apes throughout the work. If we analyze the various facts ç
provided in the epic, we have to come to the inevitable conclusion ç
that the word is to be taken, not literally, but symbolically. The ç
word `v<193>-nara' may mean `or, perhaps, he is a human being'. The ç
facial features of these v<193>naras might have approached those of ç
apes by the rather prominent lower jaws. Since they spoke a human ç
language and since the women had no tails and have been described ç
like other women of the human species, we can conclude that the v<193>naras ç
were also human beings but accustomed to live in the hilly regions, ç
forests and banks of rivers. Maybe, they painted themselves like apes ç
and wore a dress leaving a part of it at their backs or loins like ç
tail. Maybe, the ape was their national symbol. 
They were physically very strong and used their own teeth and nails ç
or implements of stone or branches of trees while fighting. They were, ç
obviously, not used to warfare with artificial weapons, though they ç
were experts in wrestling.
The  wearing  of  the  yaj<210>opav<200>ta (sacred thread) and performance ç
of the sandhy<193> ritual was current among them. However, rules of ç
marriage and the regulation of man-woman relationship do not seem ç
to have been governed by the higher ethical codes as in the Ayodhy<193> ç
culture. Drinking seems to have been quite common, even among women. ç
The level of their civilization was perhaps midway between those of ç
Ayodhy<193> and La<209>k<193>.
La<209>k<193> was rich and prosperous. R<193>va<207>a was a mighty ç
king. He had learning and power. He could even practise severe austerities ç
if and when needed. But his inordinate concupiscence and intense selfishness ç
ruined him, destroyed his kingdom  and  almost  decimated  his subjects.
@SPACE1 = 
Vibh<200><218>a<207>a the lone crusader for dharma, managed to save ç
of La<209>k<193> what little he could, by joining R<193>ma. But for ç
him there would have been no La<209>k<193>.
Ki<218>kindh<193> of V<193>li would have met with the same fate but ç
for R<193>ma's intervention brought about by the surrender of Sugr<200>va ç
to him. Sugr<200>va's sense of dharma, however feeble it might have ç
been in the beginning, and his devotion and dedication to R<193>ma, ç
saved it from disaster.
Ayodhy<193> under the noble Ik<218>v<193>ku princes, buttressed further ç
by R<193>ma's personality and example, rose to glorious heights, making ç
it a place of pilgrimage for ages.
This, then, is the philosophy of the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a: Wealth ç
and power cannot save either an individual or a nation. It is devotion ç
to satya and dharma, character, that saves, that protects!
@SB = 9.	R<193>mar<193>jya†the Ideal State
R<193>ma's rule was so ideal that the word `R<193>mar<193>jya' has ç
now become synonymous with an ideal kingdom or an ideal State. We ç
can get a fairly accurate description of an ideal State by putting ç
together the three accounts given in the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a: a ç
narration of Da·aratha's rule, the questions posed by R<193>ma to ç
Bharata at Citrak<220><219>a to find out how he was ruling and the ç
graphic description of R<193>mar<193>jya itself.
Since the `R<193>mar<193>jya' hinges on the `R<193>ma' (the king) ç
who rules, he should be an ideal person deeply devoted to the practice ç
of satya and dharma in his personal and social life. He should be ç
ever vigilant in the welfare of the State. He must have a small group ç
of ministers andadvisors of proven character and competence. He should ç
employ persons in jobs suitable to their temperament and capacity. ç
There should also be a well- organised espionage system, preferably ç
of three tiers. The ruler should disburse salaries on time and honour ç
the heroes learned in the martial arts. He should confer rewards or ç
mete out punishment to persons in proportion to their acts of commendation ç
or blame. People having faith in God and the value-system based on ç
the holy books should be protected andsupported at all costs. Atheists ç
and agnostics who cared not for this, should be put down with an iron ç
hand.
He should rule in such a way that the income is always in excess of ç
expenditure. All those engaged in the production and proper distribution ç
of wealth†the agriculturists,  the  traders,  the  dairy farmers and ç
other persons in similar vocations†must be meticulously taken care ç
of.
More than everything else, it was the supremely sacred duty of the ç
king to maintain the socio-ethical balance by protecting the var<207>a-<193>·rama-dharma ç
of thesubjects, punishing the transgressors severely when necessary.
@SPACE1 = 
Since R<193>ma was an ideal man and an ideal king, his rule also was ç
ideal. When he was ruling, people lived happily to a ripe old-age, ç
without the fear of diseases  or  dacoits,  wild  animals  or poisonous ç
reptiles. All were devoted to dharma and led a contented and peaceful ç
life sans greed and sans violence since they could always see R<193>ma ç
the ideal person before them, to emulate. Even nature was gracious ç
unto them by giving them timely rains conducive to the good growth ç
of crops and vegetation.
@SB = 10.	Literary grace
If Hindu religious tradition treats the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a of ç
V<193>lm<200>ki as a sm<216>ti (a secondary scripture next only to ç
the Vedas), the literary tradition accords it the title `<193>dik<193>vya' ç
(primeval classic) and calls V<193>lm<200>ki himself as the `<193>dikavi', ç
thepatriarch of poets. The work richly deserves this epithet and ç
has been a model to be emulated by the later poets of the classical ç
age.
V<193>lm<200>ki's genius lies in his masterly use of the similes and ç
metaphors. Whether it is the human sentiments of love and attachment, ç
hatred and detestation, valour and fearlessness or the beauties of ç
nature as the descriptions of the seasons or even the comical featuring ç
of grotesque figures, his similes are always most apt and can conjure ç
up the objects very well.
@SB = 11.	R<193>m<193>ya<207>a Literature
The influence of the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a of V<193>lm<200>ki has ç
been so powerful and deep that quite a few other R<193>m<193>ya<207>as ç
have come into existence in course of time, thereby enriching our ç
R<193>m<193>ya<207>a literature. Of these, mention must be made ç
of the Adhy<193>tma R<193>m<193>ya<207>a (4200 verses) considered ç
to be a part of the Brahm<193><207><195>a Pur<193><207>a. Modern ç
scholars however feel that it is an independent work of an unknown ç
author and assign it to the 14th century. Cast in the form of a dialogue ç
between <185>iva and P<193>rvat<200>, this work is highly devotional ç
and is dedicated to the spreading of the cult of R<193>ma. It abounds ç
in beautiful hymns and quite a few philosophical discourses including ç
the well-known R<193>mag<200>t<193>.
The °nanda R<193>m<193>ya<207>a (12,000 verses), also called Manohara-°nanda-R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
is another popular work. It is also in the form of a dialogue, first ç
between P<193>rvat<200> and <185>iva and later between R<193>mad<193>sa ç
and his disciple Vi<218><207>ud<193>sa. This work contains a number ç
of stories popular even now, such as those of Gokar<207>a, the famous ç
pilgrimage centre in Karnataka and of the r<193>k<218>asa brothers ç
Ahir<193>va<207>a and Mahir<193>va<207>a of the nether world who tried ç
to help R<193>va<207>a. This work also is assigned to the 14th century ç
or even a later date.
Then there are some other R<193>m<193>-ya<207>as, also in Sanskrit, ç
like the Adbhuta R<193>m<193>ya<207>a (1355 verses) the Yogav<193>si<218><219>ha ç
R<193>m<193>ya<207>a (32,000 verses), the Tattva-sa<209>graha R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
and the Sa<209>graha R<193>m<193>ya<207>a which have been printed ç
but have not become popular except in limited circles.
Quite a few pur<193><207>as also contain the story of R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, ç
though briefly. Some minor upani<218>ads like the R<193>map<220>rva- ç
t<193>pan<200>ya, R<193>mottarat<193>pan<200>ya and the R<193>marahasya ç
deal with R<193>ma as Parama-puru<218>a, the Supreme Person himself. ç
As regards the Sanskrit literary works based on the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a ç
themes, they are legion.
@SPACE1 = 
Other Indian languages also have been enriched by the R<193>m<193>ya<207>as ç
based on V<193>lm<200>ki's R<193>m<193>ya<207>a or its adaptations. ç
