The basic work of the Mim<193><221>s<193> philosophy†one of the six ç

S<220>tras of Jaimini assigned to 200 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> The earliest ç
extant commentary on it is the  <185><193>barabh<193><218>ya  (or  <185>abarabh<193><218>ya) ç
attributed to <185>abarasv<193>mi who might havelived either during ç
57 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> or during <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 200.
According to some scholars he was the father of the king Vikram<193>ditya ç
(of the Vikrama Era fame), by his k<218>attriya wife.
The commentary, in chaste (and ideal) Sanskrit prose, is quite voluminous, ç
dealing with all aspects of interpretation of the Vedas.
He often mentions a V<216>ttik<193>ra and quotes his views several ç
times. Whether he is the same as Bodh<193>yana quoted by R<193>m<193>nuja ç

@N1 = (`the hill of <185>abar<200>')
<185>abar<200>malai or <185>abarigiri is one of the most popular places ç
of pilgrimage even now. It is said to have got this name from<185>abar<200>, ç
the humble lady-saint of theR<193>m<193>ya<207>a fame, who lived ç
here andattained liberation. It is 190 kms. (118 miles) to the north ç
of Thiruvanantapuram (Trivandrum), the capital of the Kerala State. ç
The hill is 950 metres (3100 feet) above the sea-level and 12 metres ç
(40 feet) from the surrounding ground level. On its top is situated ç
the temple of Ayyappan (°rya or <185><193>st<193>) (See <MS><185>°ST°<D> ç
for details regarding this deity.).
@EMERGENCY = According to the local legends, the temple was built ç
by Vi·vakarman, the architect of the gods, and the original image ç
of the deity prepared by the sage Para·ur<193>ma. The present image ç
which is 46 cms. (18 inches) in height is made ofpa<210>caloha (five ç
different metals) and installed after a devastating fire destroyed ç
the temple in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1951.
@EMERGENCY = One of the special features of the hill is the Patine<219><219>upa<195>i, ç
a flight of eighteen steps. This is supposed to be the ladder to heaven.
@EMERGENCY = These steps are about 1.8 metres (6feet long and 20 ç
cms. (8 inches) wide and very steep. They represent eighteen principles ç
(5 sense organs, 8 internal enemies like lust and greed, 3 gu<207>as ç
and vidy<193> as also avidy<193>) which have to be transcended to ç
reach God. They are to be climbed only by those devotees who have ç
taken the prescribed vows.
@EMERGENCY = The vow comprises the following disciplines and has to ç
be strictly observed for 41 days before the dar·an (seeing) of the ç
image in the temple; wearing black, blue or ochre dress; wearing a ç
rudr<193>k<218>a or tulas<200> garland (of beads); strict celibacy ç
during the period; visiting temples, avoiding meat, alcoholic drinks ç
and drugs.
Initiation into this vow is to be done under the guidance of a guru, ç
either in a temple or in one's house. It consists of preparing an ç
Irumu<195>i, a bag-like contrivance with two compartments. One compartment ç
must contain a coconut filled with pure ghee (to be used to bathe ç
the image) and some items necessary for worship. The other compartment ç
should be filled with food articles needed for the journey. This Irumu<195>i ç
has to be carried all the way on one's own head.
The  pilgrimage  season  is  from November to March. From mid-November ç
to mid-December, the temple is opened for 41 days. Makara Sa<209>kr<193>nti ç
(usually on January 14) is the most crowded time of the year. It is ç
on this day that Makaravi<202>akku, a mysterious divine light, is ç
seen on the K<193>ntamalai hill†also called Ponnambalame<195>u†and ç
disappears. Lakhs of devotees assemble on this day just to witness ç
it.
@SPACE1 = 
The king R<193>ja·ekhara had prepared a number of excellent ornaments ç
for his adopted son Ma<207>ika<207><219>han or Ayyappan to be worn ç
on the day of his ascension to the throne. However, the young prince ç
had refused to wear them, but had promised to be decorated by them ç
on the Makara-sa<209>kr<193>nti day every year. So, even now, these ç
ornaments (called tiruv<193>-bhara<207>am)†now in the possession of ç
R<193>ja·ekhara's descendants†are brought from the palace of the king ç
at Panthalam (88 kms. or 55 miles away from <185>abar<200>-malai) ç
in a ceremonial procession and the image is richly bedecked with them ç
just for a day.
Another aspect of this pilgrimage by the devotees to <185>abar<200>malai ç
is taking a bath in the river Pamp<193>. This small river takes its ç
birth in the nearby K<193>ntamalai hill and flows below the 18 steps ç
of the temple. It is said to have been brought to this earth from ç
heaven by Parame·vara (or <185>iva) himself.
Women in the menstruation age are not allowed to enter the temple ç
since Ayyappan is a strict celibate!
The total number of festivals observed in this temple is 16.

@N1 = (`festival of the ·abaras [aboriginals]')
<185>abarotsava is a part of the Durg<193>-p<220>j<193> celebrations. ç
On the Vijayada·am<200> or the tenth day (of °·vayuja-·ukla-pak<218>a, ç
bright half of °·vayuja month, generally in October) the clay-image ç
of Mother Durg<193> has to be ceremonially immersed in the waters ç
of a river or a lake. After the immersion, when the crowd of devotees ç
is returning, it is expected to behave like the ·abaras or aboriginal ç
tribes. Some of the items of such uncivilised behaviour are: making ç
merry to one's heart's content by throwing mud and dust, abusing one ç
another using offensive words, singing erotic songs and so on.
All, irrespective of their status in the society, were expected to ç
join in this revelry, probably emphasizing the equality before the ç
Mother of the universe.

@NT = ·abda
@N1 = (`sound')
<185>abda is a term of several connotations. In its simplest form ç
it means sound in general.
In Ved<193>nta philosophy it means ·abda-tanm<193>tra, the element ç
<193>k<193>·a (space or ether) in its purest form. It also, sometimes, ç
indicates the <185>ruti or the Veda.
In grammar it denotes a word made up of letters and conveying some ç
meaning. It is then described as s<193>rthaka or with meaning. Words ç
or letters without any particular meaning are called nirarthaka. It ç
is also classed into three groups according to gender: pulli<209>ga ç
(masculine gender), str<200>li<209>ga (feminine gender) and napu<221>sakali<209>ga ç
(neuter gender).
The P<220>rvam<200>m<193><221>s<193> philosophy categorises the Vedic ç
words into five classesas: vidhi (injunction), mantra (sacred utterance), ç
n<193>madheya (nomenclature), ni<218>edha (prohibition) andarthav<193>da ç
(eulogy).
It also recognises that ·abdas or words can be laukika (pertaining ç
to mundane affairs), which again can be classified as vidhi, ni<218>edha ç
and arthav<193>da.
<185>abdas or words of reliable persons (<193>ptav<193>kya) as also ç
Vedic words are considered  pram<193><207>a  (valid  source  of knowledge).
The Amarako·a (7) gives different names to different kinds of sounds ç
such as marmara (sound of leaves), ·i<210>jita (sound of ornaments ç
when one is moving), kva<207>ana (sweet sound of musical instruments), ç
ruta (sound of certain animals and birds), g<193>na (music) and so ç
on.
@NT = <185>abdabrahman
@N1 = (`Brahman in the form of ·abda or sound')
This word has been used in several senses.
The Veda is known as Brahman since it helps us in realising Brahman ç
or God, the Absolute. It is also in the form of ·abda or words. Hence ç
it is called <185>abdabrahman.
The  word  O<221>  (Pra<207>ava)  is  the highest symbol of Brahman. ç
The Upani<218>ads identify it with Brahman (vide Taittir<200>ya Upani<218>ad ç
1.8.1; Ka<219>ha Upani<218>ad 2.15). Hence <185>abdabrahman is O<209>k<193>ra.
The  Am<216>tabindu  Upani<218>ad  (17) identifies Sagu<207>abrahman ç
(Brahman withattributes) with <185>abdabrahman and Nirgu<207>abrahman ç
(Brahman without attri-butes) with Parabrahman.
This word occurs in the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (6.44) also. It has ç
been interpreted there as the result of Vedic rituals (<185>a<209>kara) ç
or the prak<216>ti or nature (R<193>m<193>nuja).
@NT = <185>abd<193>dvaita
@N1 = (`advaita of ·abda')
Ma<207><195>ana Mi·ra (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 750-800), an advaitin, has propagated ç
this view in his well-known work Brahmasiddhi.
According to him, Brahman (who is advaita or one without a second) ç
is consciousness and that consciousness is the power of speech, which ç
again is of the nature of ·abda, sound or vibration. Hence Brahman ç
is of the nature of `·abda' or speech.
Though Ma<207><195>ana, following Bhart<216>-hari (5th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>), ç
a philosopher of the school of grammar, adduces several powerful arguments ç
in its favour, later advaitins do not subscribe to his views.
@NT = ·abdapram<193><207>a

@NT = sabh<193>
@N1 = (`assembly')
The earliest meaning of this word seems to be the gambling hall (vide ç
<184>gveda 10.34.6). Later on, it seems to have acquired other meanings ç
like an assembly of learned persons as well as other persons needed ç
to be present and presided over by the king. The word samiti was also ç
used in the same sense.
In all probability it was not an elected body but an ad hoc one.
The word has sometimes been used to indicate an assembly of learned ç
people, probably to discuss and decide some important issues before ç
the king.
Sabh<193> can also mean an auditorium or a building meant for meetings.

@NT = sabh<193>pati, Sabh<193>pati
@N1 = (`president of a<R>ç

@SPACE = 
In the olden days, the word sabh<193> was used to indicate a big hall ç
reserved for gambling. The sabh<193>pati was an officer appointed ç
by the king to see that gambling was done as per the rules and collected ç
fees or taxes from them.
If the word sabh<193> refers to an assembly of elders and wise persons ç
(vidvatsabh<193>), then the sabh<193>pati was the one who presided ç
over such an assembly.
Sabh<193>pati is also one of the epithets of Lord <185>iva. <185>iva ç
is a great master of all the 108 modes of dance. In fact, he is their ç
creator. He is said to dance every evening in order to relieve the ç
sufferings of creatures and entertain the gods who gather in Kail<193>sa ç
(his abode) in full strength. Hence he is called Sabh<193>pati (lord ç
of the congregation).
Iconographically speaking, the image of Sabh<193>pati is the same ç
as that of Na<219>ar<193>ja, except that he is balancing himself on ç
the left-leg and the poses of the two lower arms are reversed.
@SPACE = 
@NT = sabhya
@N1 = (`fit for a sabh<193>')
@SPACE = 
Derived from the word sabh<193> (assembly), it means one who is fit ç
to be present at a congregation of elders and wise persons; hence ç
a good and wise person.
If sabh<193> is taken to mean†in a moretechnical sense†a gambling ç
hall, then a sabhya is the officer in charge of it (= sabh<193>pati).
However, sabhya is also the name of the last of the five, duly established, ç
Vedic fires. It has to be kindled to the east of <193>havan<200>ya ç
fire, either by attrition or from the embers of the <193>havan<200>ya ç
fire. The hearth should be square, each side being twelve a<209>gulas ç
in length.
The origin of this sabhya fire is rather shrouded in mystery. If sabh<193> ç
means a gambling hall (<184>gveda 10.34.6), sabhya is the general ç
fire lit up to keep the place warm in winter. The same argument holds ç
good if sabh<193> means a big hall used as a rest-house, built by ç
a rich person.
Opinions differ as regards its establishment for Vedic rituals. Some ç
feel it is optional while others (vide °pastamba <185>rautas<220>tras ç
5.17.1) make it compulsory.

Dharma (righteousness) is the principal basis of Hinduism. Its entire ç
value-system depends on the former.
The four sources of dharma are:
Vedas; sm<216>tis (secondary scriptures not opposed to the Vedas); ç
sad<193>c<193>ra (conduct of good people); and, <193>tmana<199> priyam ç
(what is sanctioned by one's pure conscience).
Sad<193>c<193>ra is generally defined as the <193>c<193>ra or conduct ç
of ·i<218><219>as or satpuru<218>as or good persons. These ·i<218><219>as ç
have purified themselves  by  practising  the  virtues ordained in ç
the holy texts and by eschewing the ari<218>a<195>vargas (the six ç
enemies like lust, anger and greed).
Whenever there is any doubt about one's conduct in a particular situation ç
in life, one should look at the conduct of these ·i<218><219>as and ç
follow them (Taittir<200>ya Upani<218>ad 1.11).

The most important part in the building of a Hindu temple is the construction ç
of the garbhag<216>ha (the sanctum). Raising the floor of this part ç
up to the image consists of several steps. Since this process comprises ç
the establishment of six major components, it is called `<218>a<195>-<193>dh<193>ra-prati<218><219>h<193>' ç

Next comes ·il<193>ny<193>sa or foundation stone laying ceremony. ç
It is the laying of the first stone (square in shape) or brick signifying ç
the start of construction. It is laid in the north-western corner ç
of the building plan, drawn on the ground after excavating the foundation ç
to the required depth. After this, the construction of the foundation ç
is taken up.
The foundation is built and the ground filled up, up to the plinth ç
level, except in the middle portion of the garbhag<216>ha which is ç
filled up to three-fourths only. In the centre of this place, the ç
<193>dh<193>ra·il<193> (a base stone) is placed, over which are deposited ç
the following articles in that order: a pot (called nidhikumbha), ç
a tortoise and a lotus, all made of stone; a tortoise and a lotus ç
made of silver; a tortoise and a lotus made of gold. From there, a ç
funnel shaped tube called yogan<193>l<193>, made of copper leads upto ç
the plinth. The whole thing is covered by another stone slab called ç
brahma·il<193>. Later on, the image of the deity is established over ç
this. This is called <218>a<195><193>dh<193>raprati<218><219>h<193>.

Bhakti or devotion to God has two aspects: par<193>bhakti and apar<193>bhakti. ç
Theformer is the intense devotion that spontaneously arises after ç
God-realisation. The latter is the means to it and hence can be termed ç
s<193>dhanabhakti or gau<207><200>-bhakti. In comparison, par<193>bhakti ç
is called s<193>dhyabhakti.

The word `dharma' has been used in the Hindu scriptures in several ç
senses out of which the meaning `duties and good conduct' is the most ç
common one.
Dharma is usually classified into twocategories: s<193>dh<193>ra<207>a-(or ç
s<193>m<193>nya-) dharma and vi·e<218>a-dharma.
The first being common to all walks of life, pertains to all persons ç
without exception.
It is generally described as comprising the following ten qualities: ç
ahi<221>s<193> (not harming others), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), ç
d<193>na (giving gifts), k<218><193>nti (forbearance), dama (self-control), ç
·ama (keeping the mind at peace), ak<193>rpa<207>ya (not demeaning ç
oneself), ·auca (cleanliness and purity) and tapas (austere life) ç
[V<193>manapur<193><207>a 14.1 and 2].
Other virtues included in such lists given by other sources are: n<193>bhim<193>nit<193> ç
(absence of arrogance and pride), an<193>y<193>sa (avoiding too much ç
of exertion), priya-v<193>dit<193> (gentle speech), maitr<200> (friendly ç
feeling), asp<216>h<193> (absence of greed), anas<220>y<193> (absence ç
of jealousy), guru·u·r<220><218><193> (serving the elders), t<200>rth<193>nusara<207>a ç
(going on a pilgrimage) and devabr<193>hma<207>ap<220>jana (worship ç
of God and br<193>hma<207>as) [Vi<218><207>u-dharmas<220>tr<193>s ç

This is a word used specially in S<193><209>khya philosophy.
During pralaya (dissolution of the world after the duration of its ç

in the created world, until all the compounds of the gu<207>as are ç
reduced to their primary gu<207>as†sattva, rajas and tamas. However, ç
even in this state of equilibrium, there is movement and tension within ç
each gu<207>a, producing the same or similar (= sad<216>·a) effects ç
(= pari<207><193>ma). This is called sad<216>·apari<207><193>ma as ç
opposed to the change leading to creation (visad<216>·apari<207><193>ma).

<185>rava<207>a (listening to Ved<193>ntic statements), manana (deep ç

gathered from any other source since it has never been stated earlier); ç
phala or use (the utility of following the teaching thus obtained); ç
arthav<193>da or eulogy (praising the greatness of the topic to make ç

a·auca or ceremonial impurity that accrues to a person due to birth ç

Though such an impurity may extend from three to ten days, there are ç
exceptions wherein the a·auca may be ended just by sunset or sunrise ç

@NT = Sagara
@N1 = (`one [who was born] with poison')
Sagara was a king of the S<220>rya-va<221>·a (solar race). He was ç
the son of king B<193>huka and Y<193>dav<200>.
B<193>huka was a moral wreck and hence had been conquered by T<193>laja<209>gha, ç
the king of the Haihayas. When he went to the forest and started living ç
there, his first wife Y<193>dav<200> was pregnant. His second wife ç
had administered gara or poison to her without her knowledge. This ç
prevented Y<193>dav<200> from giving birth to her child, for seven ç
years! Meanwhile B<193>huka died of old age. When Y<193>dav<200> wanted ç
to die on his funeral pyre, the sage Aurva Bh<193>rgava, prevented ç
it and brought her to his own hermitage. Due to the holy atmosphere ç
of the hermitage, she gave birth to a baby-boy who was named `Sagara' ç
(one who was born with or in spite of, gara or poison) by the sage.
When Sagara grew up into a fine young man, well-trained by Aurva Bh<193>rgava ç
in all arts and sciences, he learnt about the tragedy that had befallen ç
his father B<193>huka. He then built up an army, raided Ayodhy<193>, ç
defeated T<193>laja<209>gha and regained his paternal kingdom. He ç
ruled the kingdom very well for several years.
He had sixty-thousand sons from his wife Vaidarbh<200> and one son ç
Asama<210>ja from his second wife <185>aiby<193>.
Asama<210>ja proved to be a rogue and was banished by the father.
When Sagara performed the A·vamedha sacrifice, the horse was stolen ç
by Indra (the king of gods), who left it in the hermitage of the great ç
sage Kapila,in the p<193>t<193>la-loka or nether world. Sagara's ç
sixty thousand sons while searching for the missing horse, dug up ç
the earth up to the p<193>t<193>la, found the horse, but incurred ç
the displeasure of the sage Kapila and were reduced to ashes.
When  the  king  Bhag<200>ratha,  a descendent of Sagara brought the ç
river Ga<209>g<193> to the earth, to save his ancestors, this huge ç
pit was filled up and became the ocean, called `s<193>gara' derived ç
from `Sagara'.
Sagara spent his last days in the <193>·rama of Aurva Bh<193>rgava.
See also <MS>BHAG®RATHA.<D>
@NT = s<193>gara; samudra
@N1 = (`ocean,' `sea')
The ocean†any of the oceans for that matter†derives its name from ç
the sixty-thousand sons of the emperor Sagara of the solar race, as ç
s<193>gara, since they were responsible for digging it. (See <MS>SAGARA<D> ç
for details.)
Since all the rivers are considered pure, a bath in them makes a person ç
pure, free from all sins. Again, since all the rivers flow into the ç
sea or the ocean (samudra or s<193>gara), a bath in it also makes ç
a person pure.
