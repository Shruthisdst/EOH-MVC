@NID = Brahman cannot be obtained by hurrying up in one's s<193>dhana ç
or practice. One can get it only by serving the guru or spiritual ç
preceptor.
Vidy<193> or knowledge is secured in four stages: approaching a competent ç
guru; increasing one's power of understanding; ripening of the knowledge ç
in course of time; listening to the ·<193>stras and meditating upon ç
them.
@S10N = Fourth Chapter (29 verses)
This  chapter,  the  last,  gives  a beautiful description of Brahman, ç
the object of j<210><193>nayoga, by using a good number of expressions ç
appearing in the Upani<218>ads. There is a refrain of the line yogina<199> ç
tam prapa·yanti bhagavanta<221> san<193>tanam  (`The  yogis  see  him,  the ç
Eternal Lord').
Brahman is absolutely pure, free from all defects. It is the great ç
light that illumines everything. All the gods including Indra worship ç
it. It is p<220>r<207>a (full and perfect). Space, time and objects ç
can never limit it. Even the j<200>v<193>tman (the individual soul) ç
springs out of it. When this j<200>v<193>tman realises his real nature ç
that is Brahman, in his own heart, he too shines in Brah- man. After ç
this realisation he becomes free from all ·oka (sorrow) and moha (delusion).
Thus, this treatise which starts with an enquiry about death, ends ç
in the description of immortality!

the guru of the r<193>k<218>asas (demons). When he went away for tapas, ç
<185>a<207><195>a and Amarka acted as the priests of the demon-king ç

@NT = sandhi
@N1 = (`agreement')
According to the treatises on Hindu political science, a king can ç
adopt six methods of policy. They are: sandhi (agreement or peace-treaty), ç
vigraha (taking a hostile attitude), <193>sana (indifference), y<193>na ç
(preparing to attack the enemy), sa<221>·raya (taking shelter under ç
a more powerful king) and dvaidh<200>bh<193>va (adopting a dual policy).
A king is advised to enter into sandhi (peace-treaty) with other kings, ç
when†

, <192>, He should thus wait for better days.
@Z_TBL_END = 
However, sandhi is not advisable with kings who are equal or weaker ç
in strength.
In sandhi, the king can offer his army or treasury or cede a part ç
of his territory to avoid total defeat or submission.
Several varieties of sandhis†from four up to sixteen†are described ç
in works like K<193>mandak<200>ya (9.2-18) and Agni-pur<193><207>a ç
(240).
In Sanskrit grammar, the word sandhi means coalescence of two letters ç
coming  into  immediate  contact.  For instance, when the letter i ç
comes in front of a, they coalesce into e, as in para + <200>·a ç
= pare·a.
In °yurveda, it refers to the joints in limbs like the hands and the ç
feet.

@NT = <185><193><207><195>ilya
The problem with the ancient Hindu scriptures is that we come across ç
the same name†especially that of a <216><218>i or sage†in a number ç
of places, obviously belonging to different periods of time. The name ç
<185><193><207><195>ilya (son or descendant of <185>a<207><195>ila) ç
is one such.
Several <185><193><207><195>ilyas that we find in these scriptures ç
may be listed as follows:
<185><193><207><195>ilya is mentioned several times in the <185>atapatha ç
Br<193>hma<207>a (9.4.4.17; 10.1.4.10) as a great authority of agni-cayana ç
(fire-ritual) where his agni (fire) has been called <185><193><207><195>ila'. ç
He was the teacher of V<193>tsya and a pupil of Ku·r<200>.
According to other lists of lineage, several sages have been mentioned ç
as his teachers. Some of them are: Kai·orya Ka·yapa, Vai<218><219>apureya, ç
Gautama and so on.
In the Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad (3.14) an important teaching of ç
<185><193><207><195>ilya is given. It has been called <185>a<207><195>ilyavidy<193>.
One <185><193><207><195>ilya is mentioned in the Mah<193>bh<193>rata ç
several times as a sage in the court of Yudhi<218><219>hira (Sabh<193>parva ç
4.17). His opinion on d<193>na (giving gifts) has been quoted in the ç
Anu·<193>sanaparva (65.19).
The author of an ancient treatise on bhakti or devotion (the Bhaktis<220>tras ç

Though considered a minor Upani<218>ad and assigned to the Atharvaveda ç
group, the <185><193><207><195>ilya Upani<218>ad is a fairly large ç
work dealing exhaustively with a complicated subject, viz., yoga.
There are three adhy<193>yas or chapters. Each chapter is divided ç
into kha<207><195>as (small sections) containing mantras, both in ç
prose and in verses. There are 14 kha<207><195>as and 147 mantras ç
in all.
The first adhy<193>ya containing 11 kha<207><195>as and 120 mantras ç
is not only the biggest but also occupies almost the whole book.
The second†the smallest†has only one kha<207><195>a and 6 mantras.

@SB8.5 = First Chapter
@S10N = Kha<207><195>a 1 (14 mantras)
The Upani<218>ad begins with a question on a<218><219><193><209>gayoga ç
(yoga with eight limbs or steps) by <185><193><207><195>ilya to his ç
teacher, the sage Atharva<207>a. He replies that the eight steps are: ç
yama (restraint), niyama (observances), <193>sana (posture), pr<193><207><193>y<193>ma ç
(control of vital currents), praty<193>h<193>ra (state of withdrawal), ç
dh<193>ra<207><193> (concentration), dhy<193>na (meditation) and sam<193>dhi ç
(total absorption).
Yama is of ten kinds. They are: ahi<221>s<193> (non-injury), satya ç
(truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacarya (continence), day<193> ç
(compassion), <193>rjava (straight forwardness), k<218>am<193> (forgiveness), ç
dh<216>ti (steadiness), mit<193>h<193>ra (moderation in eating) and ç
·auca (cleanliness). Each of these is clearly defined.
@S10N = Kha<207><195>a 2 (11 mantras)
This describes ten kinds of niyamas. They are: tapas (austerity), ç
santo<218>a (contentment), <193>stikya (faith in the Vedas), d<193>na ç
(giving gifts), <200>·varap<220>jana (worship of God), siddh<193>nta·rava<207>a ç
(listening to the Ved<193>ntic scriptures), hr<200> (modesty), mati ç

These <193>sanas are: svastika, gomukha, padma, v<200>ra, si<221>ha, ç
bhadra, mukta and may<220>ra.
By practising them properly one can get rid of all the diseases of ç
the body.

forth in the first mantra. Self-control, detachment. devotion to truth, ç
obedience to the parents and the guru are stressed greatly.
There is also a nice description of a place fit for establishing a ç
ma<219>ha (hermitage) suitable to the practice of yoga. Natural beauty, ç
and availability of water, fruits, roots and flowers are the deciding ç
factors. The next part deals with the preliminaries connected with ç

The praty<193>h<193>ras are: withdrawing the mind from the indriyas ç
(senses); the results of prescribed actions; all objects, and, marmasth<193>nas ç
(sensitive places) in the body.
The dh<193>ra<207>as (methods of fixing the mind) are: fixing the ç
mind on the inner Self; imposing the external sky on the internal ç
sky (dahar<193>k<193>·a, the space in the region of the heart) and ç
superimposing the five aspects of Brahman (Pa<210>ca-brahma; See <MS>PA<178>CABRAHMAMANTRAS.<D>) ç

Two kinds of dhy<193>na (meditation)† sagu<207>a (on God with form) ç
and nirgu<207>a (on the <193>tman)†are described in the tenth kha<207><195>a.
The eleventh deals with sam<193>dhi or total absorption wherein the ç
unity and identity of the j<200>va (individual soul) with Param<193>tman ç
(God) are experienced giving infinite bliss.
@SB8.5 = Second Chapter
This has only one kha<207><195>a with six mantras.
It contains the usual description of Brahman as found in the Upani<218>ads ç
and treatises on Advaita Ved<193>nta such as:
It is without attributes. Hence it cannot be defined. It is beyond ç
the comprehension of speech and mind. Whatever exists, is that Pram<193>tman. ç

@SB8.5 = Third Chapter
@S10N = Kha<207><195>a 1 (6 mantras)
This section opens with a question by <185><193><207><195>ilya to ç
Atharva<207>a as to how Brahman, the one without a second, can become ç
this universe of multiplicity.
In reply, the sage Atharva<207>a declares that Brahman has three r<220>pas ç
or forms: ni<218>kala (without parts), sakala (with parts) and sakala-ni<218>kala ç
(with and without parts).
In its own essential nature Brahman is consciousness and bliss, actionless, ç
pure, all-pervading, extremely subtle and beyond all cognition and ç
immortal. This is its ni<218>kala form.
But by using its natural, inscrutable power of m<193>y<193> which ç
has the three gu<207>as inherent in it, it becomes Mahe·vara (the ç
great ruler). This is its sakala form.
However, when Mahe·vara wills tocreate and become many, through j<210><193>namaya-tapas ç
(austerity of knowledge or intense thinking), he becomes this universe ç
of names and forms such as the Vedas and Vedic fires, the gods, the ç
living beings, the var<207>as and so on. He being in the form of all ç
gods, living beings, existing in their hearts as also beyond, is `sakala-ni<218>kala'.

is this Brahman/°tman that is known as Datt<193>treya since it was ç
born as the son of the sage Atri and his wife Anas<220>y<193>.

A day of 24 hours is divided into 30 muh<220>rtas, one muh<220>rta ç
being equal to 48 minutes. The day-time has 15 muh<220>rtas. This ç
period is divided into five equal parts: pr<193>ta<199> or udaya (sunrise); ç
sa<209>gava (milking time); madhy<193>hna (midday); apar<193>h<207>a ç
(afternoon); s<193>y<193>hna (evening). Each of these is of 144 minutes' ç
(or 2 hours and 24 minutes) duration.
The second part is called sa<209>gava because that is the time the ç
cows are gathered together and milked.
Sa<209>gava is also suitable for pr<193>tar-homa (morning offering ç

If drawing and painting can strike the eyes, sa<209>g<200>ta or music ç
has the power to rouse the heart. It has the potential to express ç
the moral and spiritual sentiments to the highest degree. It is not ç
only the medicine that can cure an aching heart but also help a spiritual ç
aspirant to raise his soul to God. That is why the Hindu sages have ç
sometimes christened it as `n<193>dayoga' and God as `N<193>dabrahma'. ç
And, music has almost always allied itself with religion and spiritual ç
values.
The three basic notes of Vedic chanting†ud<193>tta, anud<193>tta, ç
and svarita† are the fundamental notes of Indian music. These three ç
notes developed later into seven in the S<193>maveda. They are: ç
kru<218><219>a, prathama,  dvit<200>ya,  t<216>t<200>ya,  caturtha, ç

(sa), daivata (da) and ni<218><193>da (ni), in modern Indian music. ç
Hence, the S<193>maveda has been considered to be the origin of ç
Indian music.
During the earliest period, sa<209>g<200>ta or music was considered ç
to be an integral part of n<216>tya or n<193><219>ya or dancing. Dancing, ç
music and drama (n<193><219>aka) were treatedas one unit†N<193><219>ya·<193>stra ç
or the science of dramaturgy. And, Bharata's N<193><219>ya·<193>stra ç

In Indian music the two invariable basic notes are sa and pa. The ç
others†ri, ga, ma, da and ni†are of two varieties each, making a total ç
of 12 notes. Sometimes 16 notes are described, though, for all practical ç
purposes 12 are enough.
A permutation and combination of these notes produce a variety of ç
r<193>gas or tunes. Those tunes in which all the seven notes are present ç
are called `melakart<193>' or `janaka' r<193>gas. The derivatives ç
are known as `janya' r<193>gas.
Ve<209>ka<219>amakhi (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1600) in his magnum opus, the ç
Caturda<207><195>iprak<193>·ik<193> (written in Sanskrit verses) ç
has grouped the 72 janaka-r<193>gas into two groups of 36 each. He ç
has also dealt with many other fundamental aspects of music in this ç
great work which has remained as an invaluable guide to all musicians.
As far as the janya or the derived r<193>gas are concerned, they can ç
be limitless. Even now, talented musicians are inventing new r<193>gas.
The various r<193>gas or tunes are capable of expressing a variety ç
of feelings and sentiments such as love, anger, tenderness, sorrow, ç
disappointment, pity, joy and so on.
Another speciality of Indian music is that specific r<193>gas are ç
assigned to specific periods of the day or night. If certain r<193>gas ç
like M<193>y<193>m<193><202>ava-gau<202>a (or Bhairav) are to be sung ç
early in the morning, Kaly<193><207><200> (or Yaman) is to be sung ç
in the night. The very atmosphere at that time is said to enhance ç
its power to rouse the particular sentiment to which it is tuned.

sound as the one produced by the t<193>np<220>ra), r<193>ga (tune), ç
t<193>la (fixed number of beats for each unit) and laya (uniform speed ç
for the beats) are the basics for Indian music. Thirty-five varieties ç
of t<193>las have been evolved.
Though Indian music had been one for several centuries, due to the ç
Persian influence  exerted  during  the  Mughal period, there was ç
a gradual branching into two schools: the uttar<193>di or the North ç
Indian and the dak<218>i<207><193>di or the South Indian (also called ç
Carn<193><219>ic). There are many similarities as also notable distinctions ç
between the two schools. The uttar<193>di school further got subdivided ç
into ghar<193><207><193>s or traditions which are alive and active ç
even today.
A music performance is generally centred round the vocalist. In the ç
South Indian classical music the vocalist is accompanied by the violinist ç
and another who plays on the m<216>da<209>gam (a percussion instrument). ç
Of course, the t<193>np<220>ra should always be there as the basic ç
instrument. Sometimes other percussion instruments like gha<219>am ç
(a mud pot), kha<210>j<200>ra (a disc- like percussion instrument) ç
and morsing (a small stringed instrument played by mouth) are also ç
added.
In the North Indian classical music performances, the vocalist is ç
generally accompanied by the harmonium and the tabal<193> (a percussion ç
instrument in two pieces)  players.  Occasionally  stringed instruments ç
(similar to the violin) like the s<193>ra<209>g<200> or the dilr<220>b<193> ç
are also used. T<193>np<220>ra is, however, a must.
Apart from vocal music, Indian music system is rich in instruments ç
too. Even in the Vedic and allied literature there are references ç
to v<200><207><193> (lute), v<193><207>a (an instrument with 100 strings), ç
dhanurv<200><207><193>, dundubhi (drum), <193><195>ambara and so on. ç
The dhanurv<200><207><193> is said to be the precursor of the violin ç
now imported from the West. Many other instruments like b<193>nsur<200>, ç
flute, sit<193>r, sarod, go<219>uv<193>dyam, pakhv<193>j, khol, clarionet, ç
n<193>dasvarm and shehanai have also come into use over the years.

Also called <185>ana<200>·cara (slow-moving), he is the seventh planet ç
in the solar system.
The pur<193><207>as describe him as the son of S<220>rya (Sun-god) ç
and Ch<193>y<193> (shadow goddess of Sa<221>j<210><193>, the true ç
wife of S<220>rya).
