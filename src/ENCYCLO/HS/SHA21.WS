@NID = his wife. Yama and Manu were his sons whereas Yamun<193> was ç
his daughter. S<193>var<207>a and <185>anai·cara were his sons born ç
to Ch<193>y<193>dev<200> (a replica of Sa<221>j<210><193>-dev<200>). ç
The A·vins were also his sons born to Sa<221>j<210><193> when she ç
had assumed the form of a mare.
It was by his blessings that Kunt<200> (the mother of the P<193><207><195>avas) ç
gave birth to Kar<207>a (See <MS>KARØA<D> for details.)
Aru<207>a was his charioteer.
When the P<193><207><195>avas had been banished to the forest, Yudhi<218><219>hira ç
appeased S<220>rya by an earnest prayer and received from him, the ç
ak<218>ayap<193>tra (a vessel that was always filled with delicious ç
food).
It was he who bestowed the <185>ukla Yajurveda on the sage Y<193>j<210>avalkya ç
at his earnest prayer.
Agastya taught R<193>ma, the °dityah<216>dayastotra  in  praise  of  S<220>rya,  by ç
repeating which he was able to kill R<193>va<207>a.
S<220>rya is also included in the list of Navagrahas or Nine Planets. ç
He is the first of the nine grahas. He rides on a chariot with one ç
wheel and seven horses with Aru<207>a, the Red one, as his charioteer. ç
Almost all temples have the images of the Navagrahas in their vicinity ç
with S<220>rya in the centre.

@NT = s<220>ryabhedana
Works on the Ha<219>hayoga describe eight kinds of kumbhaka, the second ç
of the three steps of pr<193><207><193>y<193>ma (Ghera<207><195>a-sa<221>hit<193> ç
5.46 onwards; Ha<219>hayoga-prad<200>pik<193> 2.44).
Out of these the s<220>ryabhedana is also one. The air that is inhaled ç
through the right nostril, after closing the left nostril,  should ç
be retained until one feels that itfills up to the tip of nails and ç
hair. This is called s<220>ryabhedana. It destroys disorders of wind ç
(v<193>ta) as also worms.
The technique has to be learnt from experts in the field.
@SPACE = 
@NT = S<220>ryag<200>t<193>
This is one of the minor G<200>t<193>s composed in imitation of the ç
well-known Bhagavadg<200>t<193>. It forms a part of a bigger work, ç
Guruj<210><193>na-v<193>si<218><219>ha-tattvas<193>r<193>ya<207>a.
It is spread over five chapters and has 376 verses. It is in the form ç
of a dialogue between the charioteer Aru<207>a and his master S<220>rya.
The philosophy is <185>iv<193>dvaita, advaita centred round <185>iva.
Mukti is attained by the combined practice  of  j<210><193>na  (knowledge),  karma ç
(action, rituals) and up<193>san<193> (meditation). For a s<193>dhaka ç
(spiritual aspirant) all the three are equally important.
There is a nice description of the eternal attributes (nityavibh<220>tis) ç
and the playful attributes (l<200>l<193>vibh<220>tis) of <185>iva ç
followed by the attributes of a perfected soul,  called  karmi·re<218><219>ha.  These  are ç
similar to those of the sthitapraj<210>a in the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> ç
(2.55-72).

Hindu places of pilgrimage are legion in India.
About 8 kms. (5 miles) away from Ayodhy<193> (in Uttar Pradesh) is ç
situated the S<220>ryaku<207><195>a. It is a fairly large lake with ç

@SPACE = 
The Hindus always believed in a holistic concept of health. They considered ç
the body and the mind as one unit, each acting and reacting on the ç
other.
The s<220>ryanamask<193>ra is one of theearliest techniques discovered ç
and developed by them which accorded with their concept of health.
It has twelve postures, each representing a yog<193>sana (See <MS>YOG°SANAS.<D>) ç
and a kind of salutation to the sun.
The Hindu scriptures call the sun °ditya and describe twelve aspects ç
of the same. They are actually different names of the same sun associated ç
with the twelve signs of the Zodiac. Each has a name suchas Mitra, ç
Ravi, and so on. These names are converted into mantras (holy sentences) ç
and used for each step.
The s<220>ryanamask<193>ra has to be practised in the early morning, ç
facing the rising sun, to the accompaniment of the respective mantras. ç
The actual method and technique has to be learnt from an adept in ç
the field.

Hindu Astronomy is a very ancient science. Its source-book is the ç

Maya (the architect of the asuras) at the end of the K<216>tayuga.
The work that is available now might have taken shape during <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
400. Var<193>hamihira (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 550) made use of this work in ç
his Pa<210>casiddh<193>ntik<193>. It has three commentaries, the ç
authors being Kamal<193>-kara (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1616), Parame·vara (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1360-1455) and Ra<209>gan<193>tha (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1640). Of these, ç
the last one is the most detailed.
The book is divided into 14 chapters.
The following is a brief summary of its contents:
@S10 = Chapter 1
It deals with the mean motion of the planets. It also gives enough ç
information to calculate the mean daily motion of the planets.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Chapter 2
The method of calculating the true position of a planet including ç
the corrections needed for its retrograde motion is given here.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Chapter 3
This chapter deals with direction, place and time. The method of constructing ç
a sun-dial is also given.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Chapter 4
Both  the  eclipses†especially  the lunar eclipse†are dealt with here.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Chapter 5

This chapter gives the positions of the various nak<218>atras (or ç
groups of stars).
@S10 = Chapter 9
Heliacal rising and setting of the planets are described here.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Chapter 10
This gives the calculations needed to correctly state the rising and ç
setting of the moon.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Chapter 11
This is partly astrological in nature. The malignant character of ç
the time as related to the sun and the moon is given here along with ç
the necessary rules for calculating it.

time.
@SPACE = 
@S10 = Chapter 14
Different modes of measuring time† solar,  sidereal,  civil  or  lunar†are ç
described here.

Hindu sages paid as much attention to the life here and now as to ç
the one hereafter. That is why many great sages developed secular ç
sciences too, in the various fields of mundane life.
Since our body is the most wonderful gift of God, and since we can ç
achieve whatever we want in life only through it, to keep it in a ç
fit condition is the primary duty of every human being.
The science of °yurveda (`Science of Health and Longevity') aims exactly ç
at this.
Out of the several standard treatises on this subject, the Carakasa<221>hit<193> ç
of Caraka and the Su·rutasa<221>hit<193> of Su·ruta have carved ç
for themselves a unique place in the field of health science in ancient ç
India.
Whereas the former is a work on medicine, the latter is predominantly ç
on surgery.
Tradition considers Su·ruta as one of the sons of the sage Vi·v<193>mitra ç
and a disciple of Divod<193>sa (the king of K<193>·<200>, and reincarnation ç
of Dhanvantari, the physician of gods). He might have lived anywhere ç
between 1000 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> and 600 <MS>B.<|>C.<D>
The work is in the form of s<220>tras, anu<218><219>ubh ·lokas as ç
also prose.
Two commentaries are available on this treatise:
Bh<193>numat<200> by Cakrap<193><207>i (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1060); Nibandhasa<209>graha ç
by £alha<207>a (12th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>)
The Book, as available now, is in six sth<193>nas or sections. Each ç
sth<193>na is divided into adhy<193>yas or chapters containing ·lokas ç
(verses, s<220>tras and passages).

The contents may be summarised briefly:
@S10N = 1.	S<220>trasth<193>na (Introduction)
Origin of °yurveda; instruments and implements to be got ready before ç
surgery; operation procedures and post-operative care;  uses  of  machines  and  surgical ç
instruments; ointments and medicinal drinks; cauterisation; taking ç
out bad blood using leeches; bandaging.
@S10N = 2.	Nid<193>nasth<193>na (Diagnosis)
Sixteen   serious   diseases   like imbalance of v<193>ta or wind, ç
fistula, leprosy, diabetes and so on; their causes and cure.
@S10N = 3.	<185><193>r<200>rasth<193>na (Physiology and Anatomy)
Embryology; sensitive places in the body; blood-vessels and nervous ç
system; child-birth and other allied topics.
@S10N = 4.	Cikits<193>sth<193>na<|>(Diagnosis and Treatment)
Diseases like fistula, leprosy, fractures<%22>,<%0>kindney-stones ç
etc., and the methods of their operation are dealt with here.
This section has many more details than are found in other similar ç
works like the Carakasa<221>hit<193> or the Ast<193><209>gah<216>daya.
@S10N = 5.	Kalpasth<193>na (Toxicology)
How to remedy the poisons that might have been consumed through food ç
materials and offsetting the evil effects of the poisons by snake ç
bite or bites by insects and so on, are the subject matter of this ç
section.
@S10N = 6.	Uttaratantra (Supplement)
Also called Uttarasth<193>na, this last section is fairly voluminous. ç
It contains the descriptions and remedies of several diseases like ç
those of the eyes, the ears, the nose, the head and the mouth.
This book is perhaps a later addition.
It is remarkable that this work prescribes in the very beginning (1.2.3-10) ç
the necessary qualifications of a disciple to become a good vaidya ç
(doctor/surgeon) as also the obligations of the teacher.
Su·ruta permits even a ·<220>dra of good physique and conduct to be ç
trained in this science.

@NT = su<218>umn<193>
Su<218>umn<193> is the central n<193><195><200> or canal passing through ç
the centre of the spinal cord. It is called by several other names ç
such as ·<220>nya, padav<200>, brahmarandhra, mah<193>patha, ·<193>mbhav<200> ç
and so on.

When pr<193><207>a (life-force) is made to flow through this by proper ç
exercises like kumbhaka, the mind becomes absolutely steady. This ç
steadiness is called manonman<200> condition.
The Ku<207><195>alin<200>, when awakened, rises through this su<218>umn<193> ç
and reaches the sahasr<193>racakra after piercing through all the ç
other cakras.

His occupation was to drive the chariot of the king, to cook for him, ç
take care of his elephants and horses, and tender him suitable advice ç
on kingly duties.
It was also his duty to serve the br<193>hma<207>as.
Another important function assigned to him was to maintain the va<221>·av<216>k<218>a ç

Sut<200>k<218>na was one of the many sages that R<193>ma met during ç

He is said to have been a disciple of the great sage Agastya and had ç

water he had with him.
@NT = S<220>tr<193>tman

@NT = <185>utudr<200>
A river of the Vedic times, it has been mentioned twice in the <184>gveda ç
(3.33.1; 10.75.5). The word means `that which flows very fast'.
It is the easternmost river flowing in Punjab and has been identified ç
with the modern Sutlej river.
During post-Vedic period the name got changed to <185>atadr<220>.
According to the Mah<193>bh<193>rata this river was originally known ç
as Haimavat<200>. When the king Kalm<193><218>ap<193>da, who had become ç
a demon due to a curse, ate up all the sons of the sage Vasi<218><219>ha, ç
Vasi<218><219>ha out of intense sorrow fell into this river to commit ç
suicide. However, being afraid of killing such a great sage, the river ç
broke into a hundred streams and carried him  safely  to  the  bank!  Since  then ç
it came to be known as <185>atadr<220> (vide °diparva 177).
See <MS>NAD®<D> also.
@NT = Svadh<193>
Svadh<193> or Svadh<193>dev<200> was one of the daughters of Dak<218>apraj<193>pati ç
and had been married to the seven pit<216>s or manes viz., Agni<218>v<193>ttas, ç
Barhi<218>adas, Somap<193>s, Yama, Anala, Soma, and Aryaman. The food ç
that is offered to them in ·r<193>ddhas should be accompanied by the ç
mantra `svadh<193>'. Then only they can get the same.
Obviously this is a symbolical concept. When the mantra `svadh<193>' ç
is uttered while offering the pi<207><195>as (rice-balls), it will ç
induce the necessary power into them so as to be received by the pit<216>s ç
(the souls of the dead ancestors).
@NT = svadharma
@N1 = (`one's own duty')
This is a word that has been specially used in the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> ç
(2.31, 33; 3.35; 18.47).
It is generally interpreted as sva-var<207>a-<193>·rama-dharma, duties ç
that accrue to one as a result of his belonging to a particular  var<207>a  (caste)  and  <193>·rama ç
(station in life). Arjuna was k<218>attriya and a g<216>hastha or ç
a householder. It was his svadharma or ordained duty to fight the ç
evil forces and defend the good.
Of course it should be noted that svadharma must first be dharma! ç
Otherwise, a thief may declare that stealing is his svadharma!

@N1 = (`repeated study')
The Taittir<200>ya Upani<218>ad (1.9,11) stresses the importance ç
of sv<193>dhy<193>ya very much.
Sv<193>dhy<193>ya is the repeated study and understanding of one's ç
own branch of the Veda. Since a student of Vedic knowledge is expected ç
to teach it to others and thus keep up the continuity of that tradition, ç
a thorough study of the same is greatly stressed.
The subjects of study may include other branches of learning also ç
such as the Ved<193><209>gas, itih<193>sas and pur<193><207>as.
Sometimes the word is interpreted as japa (repetition) of God's name ç
or any mantra (sacred formula).

of Agni (fire-god). She is one of the daughters of Dak<218>a-Praj<193>pati. ç
Agni gets from her the power to digest the offerings made into him ç
in sacrifices and then carry them to the various deities for whom ç
it is meant. That is why all such offerings should be made with the ç
utterance of the mantra `sv<193>h<193>'.
@NT = Sv<193>mi-N<193>r<193>ya<207>a
@N1 = (<MS>A.<|>D. <D>1781-1830)
Sv<193>mi-N<193>r<193>yana, the founder of theSv<193>mi-N<193>r<193>ya<207><200> ç
sect of reformed Vai<218><207>avism, was born in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1781 ç
as the second son of Haripras<193>d P<193><207><195>e and B<193>l<193>dev<200> ç
in Chapaiy<193> (near Ayodhy<193> in Uttar Pradesh). He was named ç
Ghana-·y<193>ma.
Being educated by his father, he showed a remarkable mastery over ç
the Hindu scriptures even at the tender age of six. When he was nine ç
years, both the parents passed away leaving him to the care of his ç
elder brother R<193>maprat<193>pa and aunt Suv<193>sin<200>.
At the age of eleven he renounced his hearth and home and started ç
roaming about like a mendicant monk. In his sojourn through Nepal ç
he came across Gop<193>layogi, a highly evolved spiritual soul, who ç
trained him in the yoga techniques of Pata<210>jali's a<218><219><193><209>gayoga. ç
The guru gavehim the new name N<200>laka<207><219>ha-brahmac<193>rin.
After visiting Bengal and Orissa he then travelled towards the south ç
of the Indian peninsula right up to Kany<193>kum<193>r<200>. Returning  from  there,  he  proceeded ç
towards Maharashtra and then to Gujarat. He finally landed at the ç
village Loj, ending his long spiritual journey.
Very soon he was adopted as a disciple by Sv<193>mi R<193>m<193>nanda, ç
a well-known Vai<218><207>ava saint of the times, and became his favourite. ç
Actually the Sv<193>mi had known through his yogic powers not only ç
about the arrival of this disciple but also about his intrinsic greatness.
On an auspicious day R<193>m<193>nanda gave N<200>laka<207><219>ha ç
the vows of Bh<193>gavata religion (of devotion to <185>r<200> K<216><218><207>a) ç
and also of sa<221>ny<193>sa. N<200>laka<207><219>ha now became Sv<193>mi ç
Sahaj<193>nanda with an additional name `N<193>r<193>ya<207>amuni'.
Gradually, the name Sv<193>min<193>r<193>ya<207>a became more common ç
and well-known.
Sv<193>mi R<193>m<193>nanda took great care ofSv<193>min<193>r<193>ya<207>a ç
and groomed him to become the next head of the group or sect he had ç
built up, known as the Satsa<209>ga. The actual abbotship was transferred ç
tohim during the last part of the year <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1801.
Sv<193>min<193>r<193>ya<207>a initiated many revolutionary steps to ç
purify the Satsa<209>ga from inside and spread the Bh<193>gavata religion ç
extensively, especially in Gujarat. His personal magnetism and divine ç
powers brought to him lakhs of devotees and disciples, who remained ç
loyal to him throughout their life.
He reformed the lives of many people including the members of a notorious ç
criminal gang known as Khatris.
@SPACE1 = 
His disciples were divided into two categories, the satsa<209>gis ç
and the s<193>dhus. Householders and other who were not s<193>dhus ç
or monks, belonged to the first category. The s<193>dhus or the monastic ç
members belonged to the second category.
He prescribed pa<210>ca·<200>las or five rules of conduct for both ç
the groups. The first group was expected to abstain from stealing, ç
adultery, eating flesh, drinking and eating the food offered by persons ç
belonging to castes lower than one's own. As for the second group ç
comprising monks the following rules were prescribed: give up worldly ç
desires and greed; not catering to the tastes of the tongue or the ç
quality of food; renounce egoism and delusion.
This was further buttressed by many more stringent rules. Transgressors ç
were dealt with very severely.
Sv<193>min<193>r<193>ya<207>a established six Vai<218><207>ava temples ç
in six places as follows:
Naran<193>r<193>ya<207>a temples in Ahmedabad and Bhuj; Lak<218>m<200>n<193>r<193>ya<207>a ç
temple at Va<195>at<193>la; Madanmohan temple at Dh<220>lera; R<193>dh<193>rama<207>a ç
temple at J<220>n<193>-ga<195>h and Gop<200>n<193>tha temple at Ga<195>ha<195><193>.
The image in the last one resembles him and his spirit had been infused ç
intoit.
The philosophy of Sv<193>min<193>r<193>ya<207>a can be briefly stated ç
as follows:
The highest Truth or God is Ak<218>aradh<193>ma (the Indestructible ç
Abode) or Caitanya or Brahman or Puru<218>ottama. He is the creator, ç
sustainer and destroyer of the universe. He incarnates himself as ç
R<193>ma, K<216><218><207>a and other gods.
@SPACE1 = 
The j<200>va or the individual soul is different from God and is subjected ç
to the law of karma. The j<200>vas are infinite in number.
M<193>y<193> is the power of God comprising the three gu<207>as (sattva, ç
rajas and tamas) with which He creates the world. It is the same m<193>y<193> ç
that binds the j<200>va to the body and the world.
God can be realised by bhakti or devotion and n<193>majapa or repetition ç
of the divine name. In fact the word `Sv<193>mi-n<193>r<193>ya<207>a' ç
is itself the sacred mantra, divine name, that has to be used for ç
repetition.
In mukti or liberation, the j<200>va gets a divine, eternal body and ç
lives in the divine abode, serving God.
Sv<193>min<193>r<193>ya<207>a practically accepts the philosophy of ç
R<193>m<193>nuja (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1017-1137) in his teachings.
His Vai<218><207>avism accords an important place to all the five ç
gods of traditional Hinduism, viz., Vi<218><207>u, <185>iva, Dev<200>, ç
Ga<207>apati and S<220>rya.
He has left two works for the posterity: the <185>ik<218><193>patr<200> ç
(in 212 ·lokas) and the Vacan<193>m<216>tam. The former is his own ç
work whereas the latter is a compilation of his teachings by his disciples.
@SPACE1 = 
The first ten ·lokas of the <185>ik<218><193>patr<200> give a general ç
introduction. The next part comprising the ·lokas 11 to 122 describe ç
the s<193>m<193>nyadharmas, duties common to all persons. The last ç
part (123 to 212) deals with the vi·e<218>adharmas, duties and responsibilities ç
assigned to various groups of people like the householders, religious ç
teachers, kings, married women as also widows, and monks. Some of ç
the revolutionary steps taken by Sv<193>min<193>r<193>ya<207>a included ç
building of a large number of small temples especially in villages, ç
allowingwomen also to worship in those temples, giving sa<221>ny<193>sa ç
or monastic vows and robes to deserving women, appointing <193>c<193>ryas ç
or pious householder-teachers to guide the householder devotees and ç
so on.
