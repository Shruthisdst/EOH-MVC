@NT = Sa<210>jaya
Son  of  Govalga<207>a†who  was  a minister of the blind king Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra, ç
as also his charioteer†Sa<210>jaya is a well-known character in the ç
great epic, the Mah<193>bh<193>rata.
He used to stay most of the time with Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>a. ç
He had advised the blind king several times not to ill-treat or alienate ç
the P<193><207><195>avas but to no avail.
Before the Kuruk<218>etra war, he had been sent to the P<193><207><195>avas ç
as a messenger of peace, which was an entirely one-sided affair! Naturally, ç
the P<193><207><195>avas as per K<216><218><207>a's advice, rejected ç
it.
During the war he used to describe it to the blind king with a running ç
commentary since he had been specially endowed with a divine sight ç
by the great sage Vy<193>sa. He lost it after the war was over.
Though he too fought in the war on the side of the Kauravas, he did ç
not die since his life was saved by the sage.
After  Dh<216>tar<193><218><219>ra  and  G<193>ndh<193>r<200> perished ç
in the forest fire he retired to the Himalayas.
@NT = sa<209>kalpa
@N1 = (`religious declaration')
In  Hinduism,  practically  every religious act or rite has to be ç
preceded by a sa<209>kalpa. It is actually a declaratory formula giving ç
not only the details of the day according to the pa<210>c<193><209>ga ç
(traditional calendar) but also the purpose behind the act.
A  typical  sa<209>kalpamantra  should contain the names and other ç
details of the kalpa, manvantara, yuga, geographical position of the ç
place of performance, year, solstice, month, fortnight, date and day ç
of the week, as also the name of the person who is performing and ç
the purpose.
Any rite not preceded by such a sa<209>kalpa will become fruitless.

@SB = Introduction
@SPACE1 = 
When dharma (righteousness) abandons its followers because they have ç
ignored it or distorted it, and, adharma (villainy) quickly fills ç
its place, masquerading, perhaps, as a better substitute, God is obliged ç
to intervene! (vide Bhagavadg<200>t<193> 4.7,<|>8) He may do so either ç
by directly descending to this earth as an avat<193>ra (incarnation) ç
or by infilling certain chosen persons to accomplish his task of restoring ç
the balance in favour of the former.
During  the  period  preceding  the advent of <185>a<209>kara (also ç
known as <185>a<209>kar<193>c<193>rya), the San<193>tana-dharma (theAncient ç
and Eternal Religion, now commonly known as Hinduism) based on the ç
Vedas, was facing stiff opposition from several quarters.
Buddhism with its ·<220>nyav<193>da (nihilism), Jainism with its ·y<193>dv<193>da ç
or anek<193>ntav<193>da (which states that a thing can be described ç
in several ways, thus leading to greater confusion), C<193>rv<193>ka ç
schools  (materialism  that  denied  the existence of all non-temporal ç
objects), the K<193>p<193>lika and the V<193>m<193>c<193>ra cults ç
which propagated  unethical  and  abominable practices in the name ç
of religion†everyone of these was trying to shake the foundation of ç
Hinduism.
It was at such a critical period of the Vedic religion, which badly ç
needed a true and staunch follower to restore it to its former glory, ç
that <185>a<209>kara was born.
@SB = Life in Brief
Any attempt to portray the life of <185>a<209>kara runs into two genuine ç
difficulties. Firstly, the available material is too meagre to fix ç
his date. Secondly, the traditional biographies (all in Sanskrit) ç
are so full of miracles attributed to him that it is difficult to ç
accept them or explain them in any logical way.
Though almost all biographies agree that <185>a<209>kara lived just ç
for 32 years, the year of his birth varies from 508 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> ç
up to <MS>A.<|>D. <D>788. The most widely accepted year is <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
788. However some scholars push it back to <MS>A.<|>D.<D>684 also.
About 21 works that generally go by the name <185>a<209>karavijaya ç
or <185>a<209>kara- digvijaya dealing with <185>a<209>kara's life ç
in detail†have so far been discovered. Out of these, the ones by °nandagiri ç
(<185>a<209>kara-vijaya) and by M<193>dhava-Vidy<193>ra<207>ya (<185>a<209>karadigvijaya) ç
are considered more authoritative and widely accepted.
<185>a<209>kara's life as given in these texts may now be summarised ç
as follows:
<185>ivaguru and °ry<193>mb<193> were a deeply pious couple belonging ç
to the well-known Namb<220>diri caste, living in K<193>la<195><200> ç
(or K<193>la<219><200>) (the modern town of Kalady in the Kerala State) ç
situated on the bank of the river P<220>r<207><193>. This childless ç
couple got <185>a<209>kara as their son after much prayer and supplication ç
to Lord <185>iva of V<216><218>abh<193>-cala (a hillock near K<193>la<195><200>, ç
the deity being known as Candramoul<200>·vara).
As indicated by the Lord, the boy would become an omniscient spiritual ç
giant, but his life would be of short duration.
@SPACE1 = 
<185>a<209>kara was extraordinarily brilliant and mastered all the ç
·<193>stras (scriptural and other treatises) taught to him even at ç
a young age.
Unfortunately, father <185>ivaguru died soon, leaving <185>a<209>kara ç
entirely to the care of his mother °ry<193>mb<193>.
Being indrawn by temperament and having realised the transitory nature ç
of the world, through the direct experience of the death of his father, ç
<185>a<209>kara decided to embrace sa<221>ny<193>sa (monastic life). ç
The only impediment in the path was the mother's love andattachment, ç
and the need to take her permission!
By a quirk of destiny, this came about sooner than expected. One day ç
when he was taking bath in the river P<220>r<207><193>, a big crocodile ç
caught him. As he was struggling for life, and finding that he was ç
waging a losing battle, he appealed to his wailing mother who was ç
standing on the bank, to give him permission to take sa<221>ny<193>sa ç
mentally and die in peace.* She had no alternative but to oblige. ç
However, the crocodile left him as mysteriously as it had caught him. ç
As per the scriptural injunctions, he now had to take formal sa<221>ny<193>sa. ç
Most unwillingly the mother gave him the permission to do so, but ç
with a rider that he should be by her bedside at the time of her death.
@SPACE1 = 
He was just eight years at that time!
@SPACE1 = 
Having heard that Govindabhagavat-p<193>da, a very great monk (considered ç
an avat<193>ra or incarnation of the Great Serpent, °di·e<218>a) was ç
living on the bank of the river Narmad<193> in a cave, <185>a<209>kara ç
hurried there. The great teacher too was eagerly awaiting this extraordinary ç
disciple whose arrival he had already known through his yogic vision.
@SPACE1 = 
After a vigorous training spread over three years <185>a<209>kara ç
was commanded to go to K<193>·<200>, the heart of all learning† sacred ç
and secular.
As he settled down in K<193>·<200> for some time, preaching his doctrine ç
of Advaita Ved<193>nta, he gathered a number of disciples, among whom ç
Sanandana†later well-known as Padmap<193>da, one of the four chief ç
disciples†was one.
A strange encounter here with an untouchable†who was none other than ç
Lord Vi·van<193>tha (<185>iva) himself†removed the last vestige of ç
ignorance from his mind, making him a perfect being and a perfect ç
teacher.
As directed by <185>iva, <185>a<209>kara proceeded to Badar<200>n<193>tha, ç
the famous pilgrimage centre in the Him<193>layas, where he renovated ç
the old temple of N<193>r<193>ya<207>a, instituted proper modes of ç
ritualistic worship and then started writing his (now celebrated) ç
commentary on the Brahma-s<220>tras. This is said to have been fully ç
approved and appreciated by its original author, the sage Vy<193>sa ç
himself.
Later on, he moved towards South India, vanquishing and converting ç
many a scholar, among whom the greatest was Ma<207><195>ana Mi·ra. ç
According to some of the traditional biographers, it was this Ma<207><195>ana ç
Mi·ra who became the sa<221>ny<193>sin Sure·vara, though quite a few ç
scholars do not subscribe to this view.
Among those who were converted to Vedic modes of life and worship ç
were the K<193>p<193>likas of <185>r<200>·aila (now in Andhra Pradesh) ç
and the G<193><207>apatyas of Gokar<207>a (in  Karnataka),  both  of  whom  were ç
following some abominable practices.
It was again during this sojourn that he added two more distinguished ç
sa<221>ny<193>sin disciples to his retinue, Hast<193>malaka and To<219>aka.
Meanwhile, he learnt that his mother was on her deathbed, hurried ç
to her and gave her a vision of Lord Vi<218><207>u before she passed ç
away. He also personally cremated her body much to the chagrin of ç
the local residents and relatives who were against him.
During  this  period,  Padmap<193>da irretrievably lost the manuscript ç
of his gloss on the commentary of <185>a<209>kara on the Brahmas<220>tras. ç
However, <185>a<209>kara redeemed from memory that part of it which ç
had been read out to him earlier by Padmap<193>da himself. (This unfinished ç
work is now known as Pa<210>cap<193>dik<193> and has been printed.)
After completing the successful tour of the South, <185>a<209>kara ç
now journeyed to the north right upto K<193>·m<200>ra (Kashmir), vanquished ç
all the scholars and occupied the Sarvaj<210>ap<200><219>ha, the seat ç
meant for thegreatest scholar, in the temple of Sarasvat<200>, the ç
goddess of learning.
@SPACE1 = 
During his sojourn round the country, <185>a<209>kara had established ç
four Ma<219>has or monasteries in the four cardinal points at Pur<200>, ç
<185><216><209>ger<200>, Dv<193>raka and Jo<218>ima<219>ha. He anointed ç
his four chief disciples as theirheads, to carry on his work even ç
after his demise, thus creating a great monastic tradition.

By this time he had firmly re-established the Vedic religion by his ç
written works, vigorous propaganda of its principles and leaving behind ç

(in Tamil Nadu) (called K<193>mako<219>ip<200><219>ha) and lived there ç
for the rest of his life until his demise, which also took place there ç
only. The controversy regarding this has not yet been resolved due ç
to the non-availability of clinching evidence.
@SPACE = 
@SB = His Works
@SPACE = 
<185>a<209>kara was a prolific writer. He has left behind him a voluminous ç
literature which can be categorised into three groups: Bh<193><218>yas; ç
Prakara<207>as; and, Stotras.
Bh<193><218>yas are his erudite expositions of the basic works on ç
Ved<193>nta philosophy and Hindu religion. Apart from the ten Upani<218>ads, ç
the Brahamas<220>tras and the Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (collectively ç
called the prasth<193>natraya), he has written bh<193><218>yas on ç
the Vi<218><207>usahasran<193>ma (vide Mah<193>-bh<193>rata, Anu·<193>sanparva, ç
ch. 149), the Sanatsuj<193>t<200>ya (Udyogaparva, ch. 40-45) and ç
the Lalit<193>tri·at<200> also.
As regards the prakara<207>as which are simple treatises on Advaita ç
Ved<193>nta, quite a large number of them have been attributed to ç
him. Of them, the following works  are  popular:  Aparok<218><193>nubh<220>ti, ç
°tmabodha, Laghuv<193>kyav<216>tti, Upade·a-s<193>hasr<200>, ç
V<193>kyav<216>tti and Vivekac<220>d<193>ma<207>i 
A very large number of stotras or hymns, on almost all the well-known ç
deities of the Hindus, are ascribed to him. It is rather difficult ç
to segregate a few and declare thatthey are definitely his. However, ç
the following stotras are definitely his compositions according to ç
scholars seasoned in <185>a<209>kara's style of writing as also other ç
available evidence: °nanda-lahar<200>, Bhajagovindastotra, Dak<218>i<207><193>-m<220>rtya<218><219>aka, ç
Da·a·lok<200>, Gop<193>l<193><218><219>aka, Harim<200><195>estotra, ç
Man<200><218><193>pa<210>caka, <185>iva-bhuja<209>gapray<193>ta, ç
Sop<193>napa<210>caka and Vi<218><207>u<218>a<219>pad<200>.
Apart from these, two works on tantra†the  Prapa<210>cas<193>ra  and  the ç
Saundaryalahar<200>†are also attributed to him.
@SB = His Philosophy
<185>a<209>kara being the greatest propagator ofAdvaita Ved<193>nta, ç
holds the view that the basic truth or reality behind this universe ç
of multiplicity, of myriad names and forms, is one and one only, advaita, ç
the one without a second. This reality called Brahman appears as the ç
many due to the peculiar, indefinable, factor called m<193>y<193>. ç
Just as semidarkness hides the real nature of a rope (lying on the ç
road) as rope and projects in it a snake (as it appears to us then) ç
which is not there, so also m<193>y<193> hides the true nature of ç
Brahman (as Sat-Cit-°nanda, existence-consciousness-bliss) and projects ç
on that base, this manifold universe. Even as a bright light reveals ç
the rope as rope, dispelling the snake-appearance, thereby removing ç
all fear, in the same way, j<210><193>na or right knowledge removes ç
the illusion brought about by m<193>y<193>.
@SPACE1 = 
Though <185>a<209>kara has not defined and explained m<193>y<193> ç
in detail, he has given enough indications in his writings that it ç
acts like anexisting positive force (bh<193>var<220>pa) but disappears ç
mysteriously once it is neutralised by j<210><193>na (knowledge or ç
direct experience).
Once this basic standpoint that this multiple universe is a projection ç
of m<193>y<193> on Brahman is accepted, <185>a<209>kara is prepared ç
to give it a greater degree of reality (called vy<193>vah<193>rikasatt<193> ç
or empirical reality), because, then only the reverse process of attenuating ç
and eliminating it is possible. Otherwise the whole structure of s<193>dhana ç
based on this empirical reality collapses!
It is at this secondary level (of empirical reality) that <185>a<209>kara ç
concedes the process of creation of the world as given in the Upani<218>ads, ç
the multiplicity and limited nature of the j<200>vas (bound souls), ç
®·vara (God, Brahman in the garb of the Creator) as responsible for ç
the creation, sustenance and dissolution of the world and the entire ç
process of s<193>dhana by the j<200>vas to regain their lost (essential) ç
nature.
As  a  corollary,  <185>a<209>kara  also acknowledges that m<193>y<193> ç
has its individual counterpart, generally called avidy<193> or aj<210><193>na ç
(ignorance, nescience). It is this avidy<193> that makes a j<200>va ç
(the individual) feel identified with the body-mind complex, see the ç
external world of duality, feel attraction or repulsion towards its ç
objects, work to get what he wants, thus getting into the bondage ç
of the cycle of births and deaths.
Once this j<200>va awakens and takes to the path of s<193>dhana and ç
realises his true nature as sat-cit-<193>nanda, the <193>tman (the ç
Self or the soul), his avidy<193> is totally dispelled.
The body may continue to function for some time due to pr<193>rabdha ç
karma. When it falls, he is fully liberated, being merged in Brahman, ç
never to be born again.
The individual who realises his <193>tman-nature and continues to ç
live in the embodied state till the pr<193>rabdha expires, is called ç
a j<200>vanmukta (`the liberated, even while living'). In this state ç
his subjective reactions to the world have totally changed though ç
he continues to see the world as before. The man, who has discovered ç
the rope as rope in good light, will continue to see it as a snake ç
in semidarkness, since the cause of the illusion is outside himself. ç
However, his personal reaction to it has totally changed from one ç
of fear to that of indifference or even amusement.
@SB = Epilogue
If <185>a<209>kara is fondly remembered even today†twelve centuries ç
after his advent† both by the intellectual classes and the simple ç
masses†it is not a little due to his all-round personality. His bh<193><218>yas ç
and prakara<207>as have enriched the knowledge of the former. His ç
stotras on various deities commonly worshipped by the latter, have ç
infilled them with devotion. The various miracles he is said to have ç
performed†like the raining of golden myrobalans in the house of the ç
poor lady or changing the course of the P<220>r<207><193> river to ç
facilitate bathing by his aged mother†restored faith in the power ç
of tapas (austerity) and divine grace in the minds of the sceptics. ç
By putting a stop to the bizarre practices that were being carried ç
out in the name of religion by certain sects and cults, and converting ç
their votaries to purer ways of life, he saved them and the society ç
too. His convincing victories over the non-Vedic and anti-Vedic religions ç
restored theVedic religion to its pristine glory. The reorganisation ç
of Hindu monasticism made it more people-oriented through his direction, ç
viz., prav<193>sa (touring) and prac<193>ra (preaching).
Finally, his tender affection towards his lonely mother and the filial ç
duty he discharged (fulfilling his promise) towards her during her ç
last moments, speaks volumes of the intensely human aspect of his ç
personality.
He did all these things and much more, never for a moment lowering ç
his own dignity of demeanor or slipping from the sublime heights of ç
monastic life.
Only an avat<193>rapuru<218>a (an incarnation of God) can accomplish ç
such feats.

@SB = Life
<185>a<209>karadeva is the brightest star of the Vai<218><207>ava ç
Movement in Assam and north-east India, whose contribution is no less ç
than that of <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a Caitanya (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1485-1533) in Bengal and Orissa.
He was born at the village °lipukhuri (Nowgong district, Assam). His ç
parents were Kusumbara and Satyasandh<193>. He lost his parents very ç
early in life and was brought up by his grandparents. He got a good ç
education in a Sanskrit school and also developed his god-given talents ç
in music, painting and composing poems.
@SPACE1 = 
He was married and had a daughter. His wife died immediately afterwards.
He went out (when he was thirty-three) on a long pilgrimage and travel ç
spread over twelve years. He visited many places including K<193>·<200>, ç
V<216>nd<193>ban, Mathur<193>, Kuruk<218>etra, Dv<193>rak<193> and ç
R<193>me·varam. During these visits, the strong current of Vai<218><207>avism ç
he noticed everywhere due to the influence of saintly poets like Vidy<193>pati ç
(15th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>), Jayadeva (12th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>) ç
and <185>r<200>k<216><218><207>a Caitanya †whom he met for a short ç
period†practically converted him from his <185><193>kta moorings to ç
the Vai<218><207>ava creed.
After returning to his place he was forced by his close relatives ç
to marry a second time. This perturbed him much. However, the chance ç
arrival of Jagad<200>·a-mitra†a great pundit and a travelling mendicant†helped  him  to  regain  his ç
balance and peace. Jagad<200>·amitra stayed with him and taught him ç
the Bh<193>gavata. <185>a<209>karadeva's conversion to Vai<218><207>avism ç
was now complete. This inspired him to translate the Da·amaskandha ç
(the tenth book of the Bh<193>gavata containing K<216><218><207>a's ç
story in great detail) into the K<193>mar<220>p<200> (Assamese) language, ç
in simple verses.
Recurring political troubles forced him to migrate to safer places, ç
finally settling down at Belguri on the bank of the stream Dhoasuti ç
in North Lakhimpur (Assam).
@SB = Cult
Though <185>a<209>karadeva adopted Vai<218><207>a-vism as his religion ç
he evolved his own form of it and developed a cult. He carved a wooden ç
image of K<216><218><207>a, called it Madanagop<193>la and established ç
it in his prayer-hall with elaborate ceremonies. The prayer-hall itself ç
was called `n<193>maghar'.
He started his own form of initiation called `·ara<207>a'. This had ç
three categories or aspects: n<193>ma·ara<207>a, guru·ara<207>a andbhakti·ara<207>a ç
a la Buddhist ·ara<207>as (Buddha, Dharma and Sa<209>gha).
In other prayer-halls built under his supervision or guidance, he ç
installed the Bh<193>gavata-book instead of K<216><218><207>a's image ç
on a wooden pedestal. This new method averted the need for formal ç
worship, that too only by a br<193>hma<207>a, and associated rituals. ç
All devotees, irrespective of caste or religion, could offer a simple ç
service to the book before congregational prayers called k<200>rtan.
The simple process of initiation he adopted was to transmit the mantra ç
hare k<216><218><207>a, hare r<193>ma.
The Bh<193>gavata was adopted not only as the scripture but also ç
as the object of worship.
@SB = Philosophy
According to <185>a<209>karadeva, K<216><218><207>a is the Supreme ç
God who is a person (Puru<218>a, Puru<218>ottama, Parame·vara and ç
N<193>r<193>-ya<207>a), eternal, omniscient and omnipotent. The puru<218>as ç
(or j<200>vas, individual souls) are many and are His a<221>·as or ç
parts (vide Bhagavadg<200>t<193> 15.7). The insentient prak<216>ti ç
(nature) is also his.
<185>a<209>karadeva lays great stress on bhakti, that too d<193>syabhakti ç
(considering oneself as a d<193>sa or servant of God). The most important ç
aspect of this is eka·ara<207>atva (total surrender or dedication ç
to God).
Though mok<218>a or salvation (freedom from transmigratory existence) ç
is accepted, the devotee is indifferent to it since he enjoys devotion ç
to God much more.
@SB = Works
<185>a<209>karadeva did not write commentaries  on  the  prasth<193>natraya  (See ç
<MS>PRASTH°NATRAYA.<D>). But he has left quite a few works for the ç
posterity. They are: Bhaktiratn<193>kara (in Sanskrit); K<200>rtana ç
(in simple verses suited to music); Gu<207>am<193>l<193> (a synopsis ç
of the Bh<193>gavata); A<209>ki<193>-n<193><219> (one-act dramas); ç
a translation of a part of M<193>rka<207><195>eyapur<193><207>a; ç
a number of devotional songs known as barg<200>ts (varag<200>t<193>, ç
`excellent songs'). Except the first, all the other worksare in the ç
K<193>m<193>r<220>p<200> or Assamese language.
Mention should be made here of the work N<193>magho<218>a by his ç
chief disciple M<193>dhavadeva, which gained great respect from the ç
followers and became popular.
@SB = Epilogue
The bhakti-movement he started gradually spread in the whole area. ç
However, it also split into six major groups in course of time.
Institutions known as satras also came into being, associated with ç
this movement. (See <MS>SATRAS<D> for details.)

@NT = Sa<209>kar<218>a<207>a
@N1 = (`one who was drawn')
This is one of the names of Balar<193>ma, elder brother of K<216><218><207>a. ç
He was the seventh baby in the womb of Devak<200> from Vasu-deva. ç
However, Yogam<193>y<193>, the mysterious power of Lord Vi<218><207>u, ç
drew the foetus from the womb of Devak<200> and placed it in the womb ç
of Rohi<207><200>, the first wife of Vasudeva who was then living ç
in Nandagokula. Hence Balar<193>ma got this name. (Sa<209>kar<218>a<207>a ç
literally means `well-drawn'.)
See <MS>BALAR°MA<D> for details.
@NT = ·a<209>kha
@N1 = (`that which pacifies [evils]')
The ·a<209>kha or conch is one of the common objects seen in the hands ç
of images of many Hindu deities, especially those associated with ç
Vi<218><207>u, and sometimes with the Dev<200>.
The ·a<209>kha†according to the Brahmavaivartapur<193><207>a, Prak<216>tikha<207><195>a ç
chapter 18†was produced from the bones of the demon <185>a<209>khac<220><195>a ç
after he was killed by <185>iva.
There are two types of ·a<209>khas: the v<193>m<193>varta (spiralled ç
from the left) and the dak<218>i<207><193>varta (spiralled from the ç
right).The latter is considered extremely auspicious.
Sometimes four types of ·a<209>khas are distinguished as suitable ç
for the four var<207>as.
White ·a<209>khas are regarded as the best for use in worship.
<185>a<209>khas  are  used  in  ritualistic worship of the deities ç
and the water contained in them is considered extremely holy.
A ·a<207>kha may also be used to blow (and thus make sound which is ç
auspicious to hear).
Warriors used to keep their own ·a<209>khas and blow them loudly as ç
a challenge thrown at the enemies.
The Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (1.15, 16) gives the names of the ·a<209>khas ç
of K<216><218><207>a (P<193><210>cajanya), Arjuna (Devadatta) and ç
others.
<185>a<209>kha is also the technical name for an immensely large number, ç
one lakh crores (1012).
<185>a<209>kha and his brother Likhita were the authors of a well-known ç
sm<216>ti that goes by their name.
One of the nine great treasures of Kubera (the god of wealth) is known ç
as <185>a<209>kha.
@NT = <185>a<209>kha-likhita-dharmas<220>tras
If the <185>rutis (Vedas) deal with philosophical truths and occasionally ç
refer to ethical principles and social conduct, the sm<216>tis or ç
dharma·<193>stras have codified and systematised these ethical principles ç
as best as they could.
The <185>a<209>kha-likhita-dharmas<220>tras is one such ancient ç
work. It might have existed during the period 300 <MS>B.<|>C.<D> to ç
<MS>A.D.<D> 100.
<185>a<207>kha and Likhita were brothers known for their pure life ç
and uncompromising rectitude. (See <MS>LIKHITA<D> for their story.)
The Dharmas<220>tra work attributed to them is not available now. ç
From other sources which have quoted it, we can presume that it was ç
a work in prose in the s<220>tra form.
The following works available now in print may be considered as the ç
redacted condensations of the ancient original work:
@Z_TBL_BEG = COLUMNS(3), DIMENSION(IN), COLWIDTHS(1.5000,.2500,E1), ç

Out of these the first seems to be the oldest of the extant works.
Many well-known authors of dharma-·<193>stras have quoted passages ç
from <185>a<209>kha or <185>a<209>kha-likhita or Likhita.
Not much is known about the actual contents of this ancient work. ç
However, this work seems to have been more liberal in its social attitudes ç
like allowing niyoga (levirate) and permitting a br<193>hma<207>a ç
to marry girls from all the four var<207>as.
@NT = <185><193><209>kh<193>yana
<185><193><209>kh<193>yana is an ancient sage. His name is sometimes ç
spelt as (or identified with) S<193><209>khy<193>yana also. He belongs ç
to the B<193><218>kala·<193>kh<193> of the <184>gveda. He was perhaps ç
known as Suyaj<210>a-<185><193><209>kh<193>yana too.
The  Taittir<200>yapr<193>ti·<193>khya  (15.7) mentions his name ç
along with that of K<193><207><195>am<193>yana.
The Bh<193>gavata mentions one S<193><209>khy<193>yana as a disciple ç
of Sanatkum<193>ra and who was a paramaha<221>sa himself. He spread ç
the institution of sa<221>ny<193>sa.
An °ra<207>yaka, a Br<193>hma<207>a and a <185>rautas<220>tra have ç
been attributed to his authorship. However, the full text of his G<216>hyas<220>tras ç
is available now.

@NT = <185><193><209>kh<193>yana °ra<207>yaka
This is a part of the <185><193><209>kh<193>yana Br<193>hma<207>a, ç
which is better known as Kau<218><200>taki Br<193>hma<207>a.
This °ra<207>yaka follows the Aitareya °ra<207>yaka closely.
There are 15 adhy<193>yas or chapters containing 137 kha<207><195>as ç
or sections.
The first two adhy<193>yas deal with the Vedic rite called mah<193>vrata. ç
(See<MS> MAH°-VRATA <D>for details.)
The sixth adhy<193>ya refers to thecountries or areas such as U·<200>nara, ç
Matsya, K<193>·<200>, Videha and Kurup<193><210>c<193>la.
The thirteenth adhy<193>ya contains much material taken from the B<216>had<193>-ra<207>yaka ç
Upani<218>ad.
The long list of teachers given includes the names of Kahola Kau<218><200>taki, ç
Udd<193>laka °ru<207>i, Soma Pr<193>tive·ya and others who are found ç
