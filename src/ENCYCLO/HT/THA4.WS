@NT = Tirukkura<202>
@N1 = (`holy [treatise composed in the] metre ``kura<202>-ve<207>b<193>''<|>')
The  Tirukkura<202>  is  an  ancient didactical work in Tamil, which ç
is extremely popular even today. It perhaps got this name since it ç
is composed in the special metre called `kura<202>-ve<207>b<193>'. ç
The prefix `tiru' is the Tamil substitute for the Sanskrit `<185>r<200>', ç
showing respect.
Mupp<193>l (group of three) is the other name by which it is known ç
since it deals with the three puru<218><193>rthas. (See <MS>PURU<186>°RTHAS<D>.)
Its famous author is Tiruva<202><202>uvar who might have lived in ç
the 1st century <MS>A.<|>D.<D> Actually, Va<202><202>uvar is the name ç
of one of the lowest castes of the pariah group. Inthe olden days ç
they were employed by the kings and rulers to make royal announcements ç
by beating drums (tom-tom). The author belonged to that caste and ç
his actual name has been buried in the womb of history.
Tiruva<202><202>uvar is said to have lived in Mylapore (now a part ç
of the city of Madras or Chennai). He was a weaver by profession. ç
According to the local legends he was an orphan abandoned by his real ç
parents, but brought up by a couple of the vell<193><202>a (farmer) ç
caste. His contact with holy men at a tender age of five made him ç
inclined towards a spiritual life, which ultimately resulted in his ç
becoming a saintly person. His wife V<193>suki proved to be an ideal ç
companion for him. She died earlier than him. Later, he embraced monastic ç
life and engaged himself in spreading spiritual knowledge and wisdom. ç
His work, the Tirukkura<202>, when presented before the Sa<209>gam ç
(assembly of great scholars) at Madurai (in Tamil Nadu), was thoroughly ç
examined and then acclaimed as a great work.
The work has 133 chapters, each containing 10 verses, the total thus ç
being 1330 verses. They have been divided into three sections dealing ç
with the first three purur<218><193>rthas, as follows:
@LEFT = <+><+>Arattupp<193>l<R>ç

@LEFT = <+><+>K<193>mattup<193>l<R>ç
<+><+><+><+><+>(Section on K<193>ma†25 Chapters).
A brief synopsis of the subjects treated may now be given:
@SB = Arattupp<193>l
In praise of God; on rain; greatness of renunciation; on dharma; family ç
life; hospitality and kindness as also sweet words; gratitude; right ç
conduct; evils to be avoided like envy and backbiting; on liberality; ç
not eating meat; on penance; on truth; on true knowledge as also fate.
@SB = Porutp<193>l
Who a real king is; true marks of a good king; various actions and ç
policies tobe followed by a king; righteous rule versus tyranny; ç
on spies; on embassies; on fortresses and acquisition of wealth; on ç
the importance of the army; on friendship with others kings and allies; ç
things to be avoided like ignorance and discord; wine and women; need ç
to cultivate good conduct and modesty.
@SB = K<193>mattup<193>l
This section deals with, in detail, various aspects of k<193>ma (erotic ç
love) in a couple, before marriage, in the married life, during pangs ç
of separation and so on. Unlike some Sanskrit works on erotics, this ç
section is much more decent and refined.
Though the Tirukkura<202> deals with only the first three puru<218><193>rthas, ç
the fourth puru<218><193>rtha (mok<218>a or liberation) has been indirectly ç
dealt with in chapters 1, 3, and4.
There are ten commentaries (all in Tamil) on this work. Out of them, ç
the one by Parimel Azhakar is considered the best.
Recently (in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 2000) a huge statue of Tiruva<202><202>uvar, ç
40 metres or 133 feet in height, has been installed on the smaller ç
rock in the sea near Kany<193>kum<193>r<200> (in Tamil Nadu).
@NT = Tirumala-Tirupati
Whether religion is the opium of the masses or not, Lord Ve<209>ka<219>e·vara ç
of Tirupati has certainly been casting a hypnotic (=devotional) spell ç
on lakhs of devotees for centuries.
Tirumala is the range of seven hills forming a part of the Eastern ç
Ghats. The main temple is on the seventh hill at a height of 840 metres ç
(2800 feet) above the sea level. Tirupati is the township at the foot ç
of the hill.
The hill which is supposed to be a piece of the Meruparvata (See <MS>MERU<D>.) ç
hasseveral names such as <185>e<218><193>cala, V<216><218>abh<193>cala, ç
Garu<195><193>cala, A<210>jan<193>dr<200>, N<193>r<193>ya<207><193>dri, ç
Si<221>h<193>cala and Ve<209>ka<219><193>dri.
However, the original name was Ve<209>ga<195>a, a Tamil word. In course ç
of time it was Sanskritised to Ve<209>ka<219>a. And, the god on this ç
hill became Ve<209>ka<219>e·a or Ve<209>ka<219>e·vara or Ve<209>ka<219>an<193>tha.
Since the hill was also known as <185>r<200>giri, the lord of the ç
hill became <185>r<200>giriv<193>sa or <185>r<200>niv<193>sa also. ç
B<193>l<193>j<200> is another well-known name by which he is known.
The stone image of Lord Ve<209>ka-<219>e·vara is believed to be svaya<221>vyakta ç
or self-manifested and not man-made. A great devotee of God, Ra<209>gad<193>sa ç
by name, and Gop<200>n<193>tha, another devotee, are said to have ç
discovered this image which had been partially buried under the earth ç
and redeemed it. Originally it might have been in the open and gradually ç
by stages, the garbhag<216>ha (sanctum) and other parts of a regular ç
temple might have been added, spread over some centuries.
If the local legends have to be believed, a king To<207><195>am<193>n ç
(57 <MS>B.<|>C.<D><|><192><|><MS>A.<|>D.<D> 78) by name seems to have ç
built the firststructure to protect the image. The antiquity of the ç
image is further proved by the references to it in the ancient Tamil ç
work <185>ilappadik<193>ram (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 100) and by the °<202>v<193>rs ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 4th to the 8th centuries) in their p<193>·uras (verses) ç
numbering 203.
As described in the epigraphical inscriptions, more than a thousand ç
of which are available now, a few important stages in the evolution ç
of the temple structure and rituals may now be noted:
@SPACE1 = 
S<193>mavai, queen of the Pallava king,<185>akti-vi<219>a<209>ka<219>a, ç

performed for the chief deity.
@SPACE1 =

@NO = 8)
@NOK = Building up the Tirupati township just below the hill, wherein ç
the main temple staff would live, as also the Govindar<193>ja temple.
Among the various kings who patronised this temple, the role of K<216><218><207>adevar<193>ya ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1488-1529) was significant. His bronze image, along ç
with those of his two wives, is found in the ma<207><195>apa (hall) ç
that bears his name.
The temple of Lord Ve<209>ka<219>e·vara is situated on the last of ç
the seven hills at a distance of 20 kms. (12 miles) by road from the ç
town of Tirupati at the foot of the hills. It is 126.5 metres (414 ç
feet) long and 80 metres (263 feet) wide.
@SPACE1 = 
The vim<193>na (tower above the sanctum) stands on a square base (each ç
side being 8.3metres or 27 feet) and has two tiers. Itrises to a ç
height of 11.3 metres or 37 feet. It is covered with gold plated copper ç
sheets. It is called `°nandanilaya' (the abode of bliss).
Probably built in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1260, the golden cover of the vim<193>na ç
was renovated during <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1957-58.
The primary path of circumambulation known as Vim<193>napradak<218>i<207>a, ç
surrounds the main temple structure. It is 70.5 metres (235 feet) ç
by 48 metres (160 feet).
The main temple structure comprises the following sections: dhvajastambha ç
(flag post); balip<200><219>ha (a stone platform for subsidiary offerings); ç
a small gopura or tower over the entrance; mukhama<207><195>apa (called ç
tirum<193>ma<207>ima<207><195>apa, for accommodating the devotees ç
before the final dar·an of the deity); ba<209>g<193>ru-v<193>kili ç
(golden door) with dv<193>rap<193>lakas (images of god's gatekeepers) ç
on either side; snapana-ma<207><195>apa (a small room where, perhaps ç
the original metal images used to be bathed); ·ay<193>na-ma<207><195>apa ç
(the place where the utsavam<220>rti is brought in the night for ·ayana ç
or sleeping);  the  garbhag<216>ha  (sanctum sanctorum).
The garbhag<216>ha is a square room (3.8 metres or 12.75 feet square) ç
with thick walls (2.2 metres or 7 feet in thickness) covering three ç
sides. The vim<193>na is built on the outermost wall.
The dhruvabera†the main image†is fixed exactly in the centre of the ç
sanctum. Its height is estimated to be between 2.4 to 2.7 metres (8 ç
to 9 feet), since no one is allowed to actually measure it. Whether ç
it is made of the black stone (·<193>lagr<193>ma ·il<193>) or a kind ç
of wood like redwooded fig tree (= raktacandana tree), it is difficult ç
to say.
Since it does not conform to any of the rules laid in the works on ç
Hindu Iconography or the descriptions given in the dhy<193>na·lokas ç
(meditation verses) of the various aspects of Vi<218><207>u, the belief ç
that it is svaya<221>vyakta is strengthened.
On the chest, towards the right, is a symbol of Lak<218>m<200>, described ç
as an icon seated on a lotus.
There are four hands. The two hands at the back hold the cakra (discus) ç
and ·a<209>kha (conch). The front right hand is showing the varada ç
mudr<193> (boon giving pose). The left rests on the waist.
@SPACE1 = 
Some other aspects of the image like long hair, the peculiar conical ç
crown, n<193>gavalaya (snake shaped ornament) as also certain ritual ç
procedures like offering of bilva leaves and decorating with saree ç
on Fridays has given rise to doubts regarding the deity it represents. ç
Guesses galore have made it an image of Vi<218><207>u, <185>iva, Dev<200>, ç
Subrahma<207>ya or Harihara! As mentioned before, it is R<193>m<193>nuja ç
who is said to have finally settled the disputes by declaring that ç
it is that of Vi<218><207>u.
A special feature of the decorated image is the n<193>ma or tripu<207><195>ra, ç
the well-known caste mark of the <185>r<200>vai<218><207>ava sect. ç
It is prepared out of paccakarp<220>ra (a kind of camphor) and kast<220>ri ç
(musk), and covers the two eyes, the whole of the nose and extends ç
on the forehead up to the crown. Applying this type of n<193>ma is ç
said to have begun in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1465.
There are other images in the sanctum as follows: Ma<207>av<193><202>apperum<193><202> ç
(silver image presented by the queen S<193>mavai, also called Bhoga-<185>r<200>niv<193>sa); ç
Ugra-<185>r<200>niv<193>sa with the images of <185>r<200>dev<200> ç
and Bh<220>dev<200>; Maleyappa (a bigger image of Ve<207>kate·vara ç
used for processional purposes); Koluvu-<185>r<200>niv<193>sa (used ç
ceremonially like a king, everyday, before whom accounts of the day ç
have to be given); K<216><218><207>a; R<193>ma; Sudar·ana (discus-deity).
Inside the main temple campus, there are small shrines dedicated to ç
Varadar<193>ja and Narasi<221>ha (two forms of Vi<218><207>u), R<193>ma, ç
as also R<193>m<193>nuja.
It is interesting to note that in one of the old rooms, several copper ç
plates containing the songs (etched on them) of A<207><207>am<193>c<193>rya ç
(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1424-1503) on Lord Ve<209>ka<219>e·vara were discovered. ç
These songs are now being printed and widely used.
In this temple, it is the Vaikh<193>nasa °gama system of worship and ç
rituals that is being followed for several centuries, as against the ç
P<193><210>car<193>tra system which is much more common, especially ç
in the Vai<218><207>ava temples of South India. (See <MS>VAIKH°NASA ç
°GAMAS.<D>)
@SPACE1 = 
Apart from the regular daily worship there are several other rites ç
and rituals like tom<193>lasev<193> (decorating with flower garlands), ç
ph<220>la<209>gisev<193> (similar to the previous one, but performed ç
only on Thursdays) and tiruma<210>jana (bathing the image, once a ç
week, on Fridays only).
Among the various festivals of the temple the biggest and the most ç
impressive is the Brahmotsava, celebrated during the  Navar<193>tri  festival  (generally  in ç
September/October) for nine days. The Rathotsava (temple-car festival) ç
is held on the 8th day. On the last day, the utsavam<220>rti (processional ç
deity) is bathed in the nearby temple-tank known as Sv<193>mipu<218>kari<207><200> ç
(or Var<193>hat<200>rtha, because of the Var<193>ha temple on its ç
bank).
The temple is also famous for its pras<193>da, sacred offering in ç
the form of la<195><195>us (round shaped sweets) which are sold in ç
millions.
This Ve<209>ka<219>e·vara temple of Tirumala is not only the most ç
popular but also the wealthiest in India.
Apart from a good motorable road (20 kms. or 12.5 miles) there are ç
also well-laid steps (about 4000) by which earnest devotees can climb ç
the hill from Tirupati, up to the temple campus. It is 11kms. (or ç
7 miles) in distance.
Other places of interest in Tirumala are†apart from the Sv<193>mipu<218>kari<207><200> ç
tank and the Var<193>ha temple†the °k<193>·aga<209>g<193> falls, P<193>pan<193>·a<221>-t<200>rtha, ç
Kum<193>radh<193>r<193> and a few more sources of holy waters.
@SPACE1 = 
At the foot of the hills is Tirupati, themain city. The temples of ç
Govindar<193>ja, Koda<207><195>ar<193>ma and Kapile·vara (<185>iva) ç
are situated here.
The Govindar<193>j<193> temple contains the older shrine of P<193>rthas<193>rathi ç
(K<216><218><207>a) dating back to the 9th century <MS>A.<|>D.<D> as ç
also that of Govindar<193>ja established by R<193>m<193>nuja in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1130. The deity here is a ·ay<193>nam<220>rti (in the lying posture) ç
as in the <185>r<200>ra<209>gam temple. It has an impressive  gopuram  (tower)  of  seven ç
storeys.
About 2 kms. (1.2 miles) away from the above temple, is the Kodan<195>ar<193>ma ç
temple built in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1480.
Another important temple included in the Tirupati pilgrimage is the ç
Padm<193>vat<200> temple at Tirucc<193>n<220>r, 5 kms. (3 miles) away ç
from the Tirupati town.
Padm<193>vat<200>†also called Alarmelma<209>gai†is the consort of ç
Lord Ve<209>ka-<219>e·vara. Her icon is shown as seated in the padm<193>sana ç
style and holding a lotus in each of the upper two hands. The lower ç
hands are in the abhaya and varada mudr<193>s, giving protection as ç
also granting boons.
Once in a year, there is a big festival celebrating the marriage of ç
Padm<193>vat<200> with  Ve<209>ka<219>e·vara.  Her  processional image ç
is taken on an elephant to the Tirumala temple, where he `comes out' ç
to meet her! The Brahmotsava of this temple is on the `birthday' of ç
Padm<193>vat<200>, generally in November/December.

This is a very famous poetical treatise in Tamil composed by °<207><195><193><202> ç
(or God<193>dev<200>). (See <MS>°<170>V°RS<D> for details.)
There are thirty p<193>·uras or verses. °<207><195><193><202> imagines ç
that she is one of the gop<200>s performing the special K<193>ty<193>yan<200>-vrata ç
to get K<216><218><207>a as their husband. In her imagination, <185>r<200>villiputt<220>r ç
(her little town) becomes Nandagokula and the temple of Va<219>apatra·<193>yin ç
(Vi<218><207>u) becomes Nanda's palace. She goes about the streets ç
of the town in the early morning, waking up her girl-friends, to go ç
to the Yamun<193> river for bath and worship!
This highly poetical treatise is centred round K<216><218><207>a-bhakti, ç
love of K<216><218><207>a as one's lover and husband.
This work has been commented upon by innumerable scholars.
All the verses have been set to music and are very popular. Singing ç
them as also discourses on them during Dhanur-m<193>sa or M<193>rga·ira ç
(usually in December-January) has become a tradition among the <185>r<200>vai<218><207>avas.

This famous work in chaste classical Tamil language of Namm<193><202>v<193>r ç
(See <MS>°<170>V°RS.<D>) is the best and the longest among the Divyaprabandhams. ç
It has 1102 p<193>·uras (verses), divided into ten sections (centums). ç
Each of these again, has ten da·akas (decades) plus an additional ç
concluding verse.
It is interesting to note that the p<193>·uras are in the `anta-<193>di' ç
style. That is, the last word (anta) of one verse becomes the first ç
(<193>di) of the next.
The subject matter may briefly be summarised as follows:
Greatness of God; his several blessed qualities like compassion and ç
protecting his devotees; relationship between the j<200>v<193>tman ç
(individual soul) and Param<193>tman (God); bhakti (devotion) and ç
prapatti (self-surrender) as the primary means of attaining mok<218>a ç
(liberation); the necessity of performing the allotted duties in life ç
for self-purification.
In  these  prayers  to  the  Lord, madhurabh<193>va (bridal mysticism) ç
can be seen as an important aspect.
The p<193>·uras of this work have been set to music.
There are several commentaries on this work. The very first one was ç
by Tirukkurkai Pir<193>n Pi<202><202><193>n in 6000 verses. But the ç
most voluminous†and also the most famous†one is the ®<195>u of Va<195>akku ç

@NT = tiryakpu<207><195>ra
@N1 = (`a religious mark placed crosswise [on the body]')
Wearing a pu<207><195>ra or a religious mark, especially on the forehead, ç
is a must for every Hindu. The pu<207><195>ra can be <220>rdhva (upright ç
or vertical) or tiryak (crosswise or horizontal). The latter is called ç
tiryakpu<207><195>ra and is worn with bhasma (holy ash). (See <MS>BHASMA.<D>)
This mark consists of three lines drawn crosswise, with bhasma, using ç
three fingers of the right hand. These three lines are supposed to ç
represent the three Vedas (<184>g, Yajus and S<193>ma), the ç
three syllables a, u and m of the Pra<207>ava, the three gu<207>as ç
(sattva, rajas and tamas), the three ·aktis of the Divine Mother (j<210><193>na·akti, ç
icch<193>·akti, and kriy<193>·akti) and so on. The whole idea seems ç
to be to bring into one's mind, the various religio-spiritual concepts ç
so as to feel pure and elevated.
@NT = tithinir<207>aya
@N1 = (`choosing the day [according to the lunar calendar]')
Treatises dealing with the imparting of mantras, like the Mantrayogasa<221>hit<193>, ç
have specified which days of the lunar calendar (called tithis) are ç
suitable for it and which are not.
The following days are auspicious: dvit<200>ya (second day); t<216>t<200>y<193> ç
(third day); pa<210>cam<200> (fifth day); saptam<200> (seventh day); ç

(twelfth day); p<220>r<207>im<193> (full-moon day).
The other days, including am<193>v<193>sy<193> (new-moon day), are ç
considered inauspicious.
@NT = titik<218><193>
@N1 = (`forbearance')
The treatises of Advaita Ved<193>nta prescribe a fourfold discipline†called ç
s<193>dhanacatu<218><219>aya†as  the  first  step towards realising ç
the Ved<193>ntic truths (Vivekac<220><195><193>ma<207>i 18; Ved<193>ntas<193>ra ç
[of Sad<193>nanda] 15).
Titik<218><193> or forbearance forms the fourth step of ·am<193>di<218>a<219>ka, ç
the third of the fourfold discipline.
It is defined as enduring all types and kinds of difficulties without ç
reaction, remorse and worry (Vivekac<220><195><193>ma<207>i 24).
@NT = <187>o<195>ar<193>nanda
This is one of the exhaustive works on the dharma·<193>stras in Sanskrit ç
written by R<193>j<193> <187>o<195>aramal, the celebrated finance ç
minister of Akbar (<MS>A. D.<D> 1542-1605). Whether it is his own ç
work or written by the scholars entrusted with it, it is definitely ç
a great work of authority on the subject. It must have been composed ç
during the period <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1572-1589.
Though the entire work has not yet been discovered, the parts that ç
have been found so far have been edited and printed by scholars.
It is supposed to contain twenty two parts, each of which is known ç
as a saukhya, such as Sargasaukhya, °c<193>ra-saukhya, Viv<193>hasaukhya ç
and so on.
The topics dealt with include the following: <193>c<193>ra (conduct); ç
d<193>na (gifts); vyavah<193>ra  (social  dealings);  ·r<193>ddha ç
(obsequial rites); pr<193>ya·citta (expiations); samaya (conventions) ç
and so on.
Other subjects like astronomy, political science and medicine & surgery ç
have also been dealt with in some sections.
The whole work might have run into 80,000 ·lokas.

He was the son of the king Purukutsa and grandson of the famous emperor ç
M<193>ndh<193>t<216> of the solar race. He got this name since the ç
dasyus (robbers and enemies) used to quake in fear (tras = to be afraid) ç
before him. Once the sage Agastya approached him for money. Since ç
he did not have it at that time, he suggested that the sage, along ç
with two more kings†<185>rutarva and Bradhn<193>·va, who had come ç
with him†approach Ilvala, a rich and powerful d<193>nava (belonging ç
to the race of demons).
When  Agastya  met  him,  Ilvala realised his greatness and gave him ç
all the money he needed.

@NT = tr<193><219>aka
It is the fifth of the <218>a<219>karmas (six ha<219>hayogic practices ç
meant to purify the body). It consists in gazing at any small object ç
without winking until tears begin to flow. This practice is supposed ç
to confer clairvoyant powers apart from curing all diseases of the ç
eyes (Ghera<207><195>a Sa<221>hit<193> 1.53, 54).
See <MS><186>A<187>KARMAS<D> also.
@NT = t<216>c<193>kalpanamask<193>ra
S<220>ryanamask<193>ra (bowing down to S<220>rya or the Sun-god) is ç
practised by the Hindus not only as good exercise but also as a religious ç
act.
It has to be done facing the rising sun in the early morning. There ç
are twelve postures in it. Each posture has to be accompanied by the ç
prescribed mantra containing one of the names of S<220>rya like Mitra, ç
Ravi, S<220>rya, Bh<193>nu and so on.
The t<216>c<193>kalpanamask<193>ra is one method in which after Om, ç
a few mystic syllables and their combinations in twos and fours together ç
with certain mantras are repeated with the twelve names.
For instance: O<221> hr<193>m udyannadya mitra maha<199> hr<193>m ç
O<221> mitr<193>ya nama<199><F49P12W1>f<F255P255D> This is the first mantra.
@NT = Tret<193>yuga
According to the descriptions given in the epics and the pur<193><207>as, ç
a yuga is a colossal unit of time. (See <MS>YUGA<D> for more details.)
Out of the four yugas normally described, the Tret<193>yuga is the ç
second in the series. It has been called `tret<193>' (=three) since ç
it is three times longer in duration than the Kaliyuga, the fourth ç
and the last in the series.
It lasts for 3600 divine years or 12,96,000 human years!
Compared to the K<216>tayuga, the first, where dharma or righteousness ç
was fully manifested, in this yuga it was less by a quarter.
In this yuga, people were devoted to truth and performed their duties ç
properly. The religion of sacrifices†yaj<210>as or y<193>gas†got manifested ç
in this age for the first time. Hence they became extremely popular.

Brahman†God the Absolute†creates the world, sustains it and withdraws ç
it back into Himself (vide Brahmas<220>tras 1.1.2). In paur<193><207>ic ç
Hinduism this Brahman is described as three deities: Brahm<193> responsible ç
for creation; Vi<218><207>u responsible for its sustenance; and, Rudra ç
or <185>iva responsible for its destruction at the end of a cosmic ç
cycle. These three deities correspond to the three gu<207>as (rajas, ç
sattva and tamas) in the cosmic play of creation, sustenance and destruction.
They are the Trim<220>rtis (or the Hindu Trinity).
There are composite images in which all the three gods are represented, ç
like Datt<193>treya.

@NT = Tripur<193>
@N1 = (`one endowed with three bodies or forms')
Tripur<193> is the most popular form of the Mother-goddess, associated ç
with the creation, sustenance and destruction of the world. She is ç
known as Tripur<193> because she has a threefold form of bindu (primeval ç
`drop'), b<200>ja (primordial `seed') and n<193>da (original sound-vibration). ç
The triangle is her symbol.
She is the totality of the three gu<207>as†sattva, rajas and tamas†and ç
their operation.
She is sometimes included among the ten goddesses called Da·amah<193>vidy<193>s ç
and identified with Tripurasundar<200>.
She is the totality of V<193><207><200> (Sarasvat<200>), Ram<193> ç
(Lak<218>m<200>) and Rudr<193><207><200> (P<193>rvat<200>) as also ç
of Brahm<193>, Vi<218><207>u and Mahe·vara (<185>iva).
Her iconographic description given in the work Tripur<193>rahasya ç
is as follows: She has twelve arms carrying the characteristic weapons ç
of all the three deities. She has ten faces, with three eyes each. ç
She is extremely beautiful.
@NT = Tripurabhairav<200>
@N1 = (`[the Mother-goddess <R>ç
who is] fierce towards the three realms')
She is one of the major forms of the Mother goddess worshipped in ç
her fierce as well as benevolent aspects.
Tripura signifies the three worlds† bh<220> (the earth), bhuva<199> ç
(the middle region) and suva<199> (the heaven)†which she, in her fierce ç
aspect, destroys at the end of a cycle of creation. It stands for ç
dharma (virtue), artha (wealth) and k<193>ma (pleasure) in her benevolent ç
aspect.
Iconographical works describe her thus: In her benevolent form, she ç
is very bright like a thousand rising suns. She wears reddish silken ç
garments. She has four arms, carrying in her two hands a book and ç
a rosary while the other two exhibit the postures of boon-giving (varadamudr<193>) ç
and protection (abhayamudr<193>).
In her fierce aspect she is shown as red in colour, with parted lips ç
revealing blood-shot teeth and the eyes wild with intoxication. She ç
wears garlands of skulls or a garland of three heads (of Brahm<193>, ç
Vi<218><207>u and Rudra)!
In both these aspects she has three eyes and four arms. She also has ç
matted hair-braids tied up into a topknot and adorned with a crescent ç
moon.

@N1 = (`one who had committed three ·a<209>kus or sins')
There can be no better example for human frailty than that of Tri·a<209>ku ç
(a king of the Ik<218>v<193>ku race), who happenedto be the father ç
of Hari·candra, the redoubtable champion of satya or truth. That his ç
father Nibandhana had christened him `Satyavrata' (= one who follows ç
truth religiously) might be construed as adding insult to injury!
Since the prince Satyavrata had committed three ·a<209>kus or sins†adultery, ç
killing a cow and eating its flesh†he came to be known as Tri·a<209>ku.
Once he decided to perform a sacrifice that would enable him to go ç
to svarga (heaven), keeping his physical body intact. The well-known ç
sage Vi·v<193>mitra agreed to do it for him. However, the gods in ç
heaven refused to come and accept his offerings. Incensed by this, ç
Vi·v<193>mitra started sending Tri·a<209>ku to svarga, by the power ç
of his tapas or austerities. WhenSatyavrata was halfway through his ç
upward journey, he was cursed by Indra to fall on earth, upside down. ç
Vi·v<193>mitra came to his rescue again by stopping him in the middle ç
of the sky and started creating a separate heaven for his sake! Alarmed ç
by this, the gods of heaven under Indra's leadership pleaded with ç
the sage that Tri·a<209>ku, because of his threefold sin, was unfit ç
to enter heaven. As a compromise it was agreed that Tri·a<209>ku would ç
stay where he was, surrounded by his own world of stars.
Tri·a<209>ku-svarga has now become a byword for anything which is ç
`neither here, nor there' (vide R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, B<193>lak<193><207><195>a ç

This Upani<218>ad, though classed among the minor Upani<218>ads, is ç

Assigned to the <185>ukla Yajurveda, it is in two sections. The ç
first one which is called Br<193>hma<207>abh<193>ga, is in prose ç
and has nine passages. The second one called Mantrabh<193>ga, has ç
165 verses in the anu<218><219>ubh metre.
Since a greater part of the text deals with Yoga, it is included among ç
the Yoga-Upani<218>ads.
The first section deals with the process of creation from Brahman, ç
in a general way, as is found in other Upani<218>ads and the S<193><209>khya ç
system.
The topics delineated in the second section may be summarised as follows:
Four states of consciousness, tur<200>ya (the fourth) being the <193>tman; ç
the two paths Devay<193>na (or Uttar<193>ya<207>a) and Pit<216>y<193>na ç
