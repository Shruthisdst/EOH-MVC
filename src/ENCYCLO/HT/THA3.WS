The Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (17.14-19) deals with tapas from three ç
angles: ·<193>r<200>ra (physical), v<193><209>maya (as pertaining ç
to speech) and m<193>nasa (mental). Honouring and serving gods and ç
holy persons, cleanli-ness,celibacy and non-violence belong to the ç
first category. Sweet but truthful speech belongs to the second category. ç
Control of mind and purity of emotions are the essential elements ç
of the third.
The G<200>t<193> further qualifies these three kinds from the standpoint ç
of the three gu<207>as. S<193>ttvik tapas is that which is performed ç
by persons of pure character possessing concentration and faith. The ç
tapas performed by persons who are hypocrites, for selfish benefits ç
like name and honour, is termed r<193>jasik. The one undertaken by ç
foolish persons to harm others is classed at t<193>masik.

@NT = tarka
@N1 = (`logic,' `reasoning')
@SPACE = 
@SPACE = 
Tarka or logic, which depends upon <220>h<193> or guessing, is one ç
of the aids to attaining correct knowledge when direct and clear knowledge ç
is not possible. Philosophical treatises often take recourse to it.
As far as the spiritual truths beyond the ken of the senses are concerned, ç
tarka is not accepted as an independent source of knowledge. It is ç
accepted only if it does not go against the <185>ruti (Vedas) but ç
strengthens its teachings.
The word tarka is also used in the sense of Tarka·<193>stra or the ç
Science of Logic. The Ny<193>ya and the Vai·e<218>ika schools are ç
generally considered Tarka-·<193>stras. There are also independent ç
works on the same subject.
Tarka as logical reasoning can be proved with a simple illustration. ç
When we notice smoke rising from a nearby hillock, we conclude that ç
there is a fire on it though we do not actually see the fire itself. ç
This is because, in our prior experience, we have observed that wherever ç
there had been smoke, there was a fire also. If someone argues that ç
smoke may be there even without fire, the reply is that it cannot ç
be, since smoke and firehave always gone together. This is a universal ç
experience. This method of proving is tarka.
Works on tarka have described eleven varieties of the same. They are: ç
anavasth<193>, anyony<193>·raya,   apav<193>da,   <193>tm<193>·raya, ç
cakraka, kalpan<193>gaurava, kalpan<193>-l<193>ghava, pratibandhikalpan<193>, ç
utsarga, vaij<193>tya and vy<193>gh<193>ta. (See under each title ç

@NT = Tarkasa<209>graha
@SPACE = 
@SPACE = 
The Tarkasa<209>graha is an elementary treatise on logic as delineated ç
in the Ny<193>yaand Vai·e<218>ika systems of Hindu philosophy.
Its  author  is  Annambha<219><219>a  who probably lived during the ç
period<MS>A. D.<D> 1625-1700. He was a br<193>hma<207>a belonging ç
to a <184>gveda school. He hailed from the Taila<209>ga country ç
(the modern Andhra Pradesh).  His  father  was  Meligiri Tirumalar<193>ya. ç
He was a great scholar in Advaita Ved<193>nta, Vy<193>kara<207>a (Sanskrit ç
grammar) and M<200>m<193><221>s<193>.
On the Tarkasa<209>graha he himself wrote a commentary called Tarkad<200>pik<193> ç
or D<200>pik<193>.
Actually there are 25 commentaries on the Tarkasa<209>graha and ç
10 on the D<200>pik<193>! This itself is a proof of its popularity ç
over the centuries.
The whole work is in prose and has ten sections.
A brief summary of the work may now be attempted here:
The first section enumerates the seven categories known as the sapta-pad<193>rthas ç
in the Vai·e<218>ika philosophy andexplains them. (See <MS>VAI<185>E<186>IKA ç
DAR<185>ANA<D> for details.)
The second section describes in detail the various dravyas or substances.
The third section deals with the characteristic marks of the twenty-four ç
gu<207>as or qualities.
The fourth section starts delineating the epistemology (methods of ç
knowledge) according to the Ny<193>ya and the Vai·e<218>ika systems. ç
Pratyak<218>a (direct perception) is dealt with in detail here.
The fifth section deals with anum<193>nas or inference, with all the ç
necessary details, including `false knowledge'.
The sixth section which is very brief, describes upam<193>na or analogy.
The seventh section is concerned with ·abda or verbal testimony.
The eighth consists of only the D<200>pik<193> (Annambha<219><219><193>'s ç
gloss on his own work) which discusses the theory of knowledge according ç
to the Ny<193>ya school. The theory of the M<200>m<193><221>s<193> ç
school is taken up and refuted.
The subject of the ninth section is ayath<193>rtha-anubhava or erroneous ç
apprehension. It also deals with the five pad<193>rthas (substances) ç
left out earlier, viz., karma (action), s<193>m<193>nya (universal) ç
and so on.
The last section, the tenth, is the concluding chapter. Here the author ç
has tried to prove that the pad<193>rthas or categories are only ç
seven and not more as enumerated by the Ny<193>ya system of Gautama. ç
He also states that, ultimately it is j<210><193>na or knowledge that ç
leads to liberation.
@NT = T<193>rk<218>ya
@N1 = (`descendant of T<216>k<218>i')
This is one of the names of Garu<195>a the mount of Vi<218><207>u. ç
It is difficult to say whether he was a descendant of T<216>k<218>i, ç
a prince of an earlier generation.
It is also the name of a sage who is supposed to have been taught ç
by goddess Sarasvat<200> herself once (Mah<193>bh<193>rata, Vanaparva ç
186).
A king, Dundhum<193>ra by name, accidentally killed the son of the ç
sage T<193>rk<218>ya. When he apologised profusely to the sage, the ç
latter called his son by name and he rose up alive! The sage explained ç
that his hermitage as also himself had acquired that power due to ç
good and pure conduct (vide Mah<193>bh<193>rata, Vanaparva, 184).
@NT = tarpa<207>a
@N1 = (`satiating')
Tarpa<207>a is one of the items connected with <193>hnika or daily ç
ritual to be performed by a dvija (the twice-born, members of the ç
first three castes). It is a part of sn<193>na (bath) as also the ç
pa<210>camah<193>yaj<210>as (See <MS>PA<178>CAMAH°YAJ<178>AS<D> for ç
details.).
While still standing in water after bathing (in a river or tank) one ç
has to offer water thrice taking it in the joined palms of hand, with ç
appropriate mantras, to all beings of creation, from Brahm<193> (the ç
creator) up to a blade of grass.
Tarpa<207>a to devas (gods), pit<216>s (manes) and <216><218>is (sages) ç
is a compulsory part of the daily routine of every brahmac<193>rin ç
(vide Manusm<216>ti 2.176).
The water may sometimes be mixed with sesame. Such tarpa<207>a is ç
said to satiate the gods, manes and sages to whom it is offered.

He was a ve<202><202><193><202>a by caste and was attached to the ç
great <185>iva temple at Ved<193>ra<207>yam near Tanjavoor (Tanjore). ç
By virtue of his learning and character he became a high official ç
in the court of the Naik ruler, Vijayara<209>ga Cokkan<193>thar, of ç
Tiruchirapalli. Since he yearned for spiritual wisdom he gave up his ç
job and spent his time in s<193>dhana under an able guide.
He composed quite a few poems in Tamil, making an attempt to synthesise ç
Ved<193>nta with <185>aivasiddh<193>nta. He rose above the narrow ç
religious disputes andreached high levels of philosophical wisdom.
@NT = Tegh Bah<193>dur, Guru
@N1 = (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1621-1675)
Guru Tegh Bah<193>dur sacrificed himself bravely to protect the br<193>hma<207>as ç
from Kashmir who had taken refuge in him. He thus became a martyr ç
in the cause of dharma and hence an immortal.
He was born at Am<216>tsar as theyoungest of the five sons of Guru ç
Hargobind (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1595-1644). The early years of his life were ç
spent at Am<216>tsar where he was trained by Bh<193><200> Bu<195><195>h<193> ç
and Bh<193><200> Gurud<193>s in martial arts as also in religious ç
texts.
He was of a contemplative and mystical temperament. This found an ç
expression in later years in poetry of deep spiritual insight.
At the tender age of twelve he was married to Gujar<200>, daughter ç
of L<193>l Cand and Bi·an Kaur hailing from Kart<193>rpur.
From <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1628 onwards, the Sikhs were forced to come into ç
conflict with the Mughal emperor Sh<193>h Jeh<193>n (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1592-1666). Guru Tegh Bah<193>dur too had to take part in one of the ç
battles (at Kart<193>rpur in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1635) and fought bravely.
After this battle, Guru Hargobind retired to Kart<193>rpur. Tegh Bah<193>dur ç
too moved with him and had an opportunity to live with him and serve ç
him for nine long years.
When Guru Hargobind passed away in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1644, Tegh Bah<193>dur ç
shifted to Bak<193>l<193>, a village in Am<216>tsar district and lived ç
a retired life spending most of his time in meditation and austerities ç
according to Sikhism.
When the Guru Hark<216><218>a<207>†the eighth Guru†passed away at ç
Kir<193>tpur in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1664, alluding to the next Guru in ratherambiguous ç
terms, several `Gurus' or claimants to the throne of the Guru† twenty-two, ç
to be more specific†appeared on the scene. However, the miraculous ç
experience of Makkhan Sh<193>h, a rich businessman, settled the issue ç
and Tegh Bah<193>dur assumed the Guru's mantle in August 1664. He ç
then shifted to Am<216>tsar.
@SPACE1 = 
He established contacts with all the sa<209>gats (Sikh congregations) ç
through masands (Sikh priests) and started issuing hukamn<193>mas ç
(edicts or commandments) now and then.
He  travelled  widely.  It  was  he who established the town now known ç
as °nandpur.
Gobind D<193>s (later known as Guru Gobind Singh) was born to him ç
at Patna in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1666 during his travels.
When he was at °nandpur a group of Kashmiri br<193>hma<207>as who ç
had been oppressed by the Mughal governor came and sought his protection. ç
While accepting the challenge of their protection he is said to have ç
remarked that the Mother Earth would be redeemed only if a truly worthy ç
person came forward to sacrifice his head. His son Gobind D<193>s ç
who was just nine years old at that time, remarked, `None could be ç
worthier than yourself for such a noble act.' The Guru appreciated ç
this remark. After nominating him as his successor and conferring ç
on him the marks of Guruship he left the place. He was arrested by ç
the agents of the then Mughal emperor Aurangzeb (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1618-1707) ç
and kept in prison for over three months. He was later tortured and ç
beheaded in the Chandini Chowk of Delhi because he refused to accept ç
Islam. His devoted disciples smuggled his head and torso and got them ç
cremated. The two places with Gurudv<193>ras containing the relics ç
are °nandpur (in Punjab) and Rik<193>bga<210>j (in Delhi).
Thus ended the life of a great man who voluntarily became a martyr ç
in the cause of his religion.
Guru Tegh Bah<193>dur's b<193><207><200> (teachings) is small in bulk, ç
comprising 59 ·abads (sayings) and 57 ·lokas (verses) in all. The ç

Yajurveda group. It is a fairly long work with 466 verses in the ç
anu<218><219>ubh metre, divided into six chapters. The first chapter ç
is a direct presentation of the teaching by the Upani<218>ad. Chapters ç
two, three and four are in the form of a dialogue between Skanda (god ç
Subrahma<207>ya) and his father <185>iva. The last two are a conversation†in ç
the question-answer form†between the disciple Nid<193>gha and his ç
teacher <184>bhu.
The following is a brief synopsis of the contents:
@S10N = First Chapter (51 verses)
Description of Tejobindu (Brahman as the source of spiritual light); ç
some s<193>dhanas that lead to it, such as control over food, conquering ç
anger and attachment, self-control and absence of egotism; yoga of ç
fifteen steps comprising yama (control of senses), niyama (continuous ç
meditation on the Self as consciousness), ty<193>ga (renouncing the ç
world-appearance by seeing Brahman in it), mauna (observing silence) ç
and so on; practice of yoga and overcoming the various obstacles to ç
it; attaining Brahman through sam<193>dhi.
@S10N = Second Chapter (43 verses)
This  chapter  describes  that everything that exists is `akha<207><195>aikarasa' ç
or `non-dual and partless essence' (i.e., Brahman).
@SPACE1 = 
@S10N = Third Chapter (74 verses)
°tman is the same as Brahman which is sat-cit-<193>nanda or existence-consciousness-bliss. ç
This experience can be got by practising the mantra, aham brahm<193>smi, ç
`I am Brahman'. This is the gist of this chapter.
@SPACE1 = 
@S10N = Fourth Chapter (82 verses)
J<200>vanmukti (liberation while living) and videhamukti (liberation ç
from future births) are the topics described in a highly poetical ç
language.
@SPACE1 = 
@S10N = Fifth Chapter (105 verses)
This  chapter  describes  the  true nature of the <193>tman as identified ç
with Param<193>tman. The world that is grasped through the senses ç
has no permanent and independent existence. Bondage of the individual ç
(j<200>v<193>tman) is due to the mind which is constantly desiring ç
things.
@SPACE1 = 
@S10N = Sixth Chapter (111 verses)
All the ideas given earlier are more or less repeated here.
Rules are laid down here as to whom this teaching can be given and ç
to whom it should not be imparted.
Atheists, ungrateful ones and persons of bad character are unfit to ç
receive it.
Only those of a pure mind and endowed with devotion to the guru are ç
fit to be taught.
The final declaration is that even a study of this Upani<218>ad is ç
enough to give liberation!

One of the most towering personalities of pre-Independence India who ç
fought for the freedom of this country was B<193>l Ga<209>g<193>dhar ç
<187>i<202>ak.
Born as the only son of Ga<209>g<193>dhar Pant and P<193>rvat<200> ç
in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1856 at Ratnagiri (in Maharashtra), he was extraordinarily ç
intelligent, endowed with an iron will. He was well-educated in Sanskrit ç
and Mar<193><219>h<200> apart from the usual subjects in languages ç
and science.
After getting his Law degree in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1879, he rather preferred ç
the teaching profession. He, along with one friend, Agarkar by name, ç
started the New English School, the very next year. It became an instant ç
success because of its special methods of teaching and strict discipline. ç
Within a few years it grew into a big educational institution known ç
as Deccan Education Society.
<187>i<202>ak started two newspapers†Kesar<200> in Mar<193><219>h<200> ç
and Mar<193><219>h<193> in English† which were totally dedicated ç
to nationalism and freedom struggle. His revolutionary writings in ç
these journals made him a hero in the eyes of the people whereas it ç
also roused the wrath of the British rulers.
During this period, he started the tradition of public celebrations ç
of the Ga<207>e·a festival with a view to uniting all the Hindus irrespective ç
of their caste or creed. This, very soon attained the status of a ç
national festival.
He also did relief work among the masses during famine in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> ç
1896 and epidemic diseases next year.
He was closely associated with the Indian National Congress along ç
with L<193>l<193> Lajpat Roy (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1865-1928), Bipincandra ç
P<193>l (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1858-1932) and many other well-known leaders. ç
His active propagation for attaining ``Svar<193>jya' (independence) ç
through the famous statement, `Svar<193>j is my birthright!' resulted ç
in his imprisonment several times. It was during the six-year period ç
that he spent in the Mandalay jail (in the then Burma, now Myanmar) ç
that he wrote his now famous work G<200>t<193>rahasya. His other ç
works are Orion: Researches into the Antiquities of the Vedas ç
and The Arctic Home of the °ryans.
Launching the Home Rule League to mobilise public opinion towards ç
political freedom and drafting a comprehensive blueprint for the reconstruction ç
of India after freedom were his other contributions.

These pilgrim centres are legion and are spread all over India, from ç
Amarn<193>th in the north to R<193>me·varam in the south and Somn<193>th ç
in the west up to Pur<200> in the east. If the sthalapur<193><207>as ç
or the local legends have to be believed, these places are all extremely ç
ancient, closely connected with the persons and incidents narrated ç
in the epics and the pur<193><207>as. Of course, places associated ç
with great saints and religious leaders of the historical period are ç
also taken into consideration.
More often than not, these places of pilgrimage are situated in spots ç
of natural scenery and beauty like mountain-tops, valleys, banks of ç
rivers, islands, forests, seashore and other similar regions which ç
are congenial to contemplation.
Over the centuries, Vedic sacrifices gradually faded out due to their ç
inherent difficulties in performing them. Their place was soon taken ç
up by p<220>j<193>s (ritualistic worship), homas (oblations into consecrated  fires  associated  with  popular ç
deities), vratas (religious vows) and t<200>rtha-y<193>tras (pilgrimages). ç
These were eulogised as easy to perform, but, giving equally good ç
and quick results.
@SB = Literature
Literature on t<200>rthay<193>tras is very extensive. In the Mah<193>bh<193>rata ç
and the pur<193><207>as there are 40,000 verses concerning this subject.
They have been dealt with in independent treatises also.
Some of them are:
@LEFT = 	K<216>tya-kalpataru of Lak<218>m<200>dhara<R>ç
		(12th Century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>)
@LEFT = 	Caturvargacint<193>ma<207>i of Hem<193>dri<R>ç
		(13th Century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>)
@LEFT = 	T<200>rthacint<193>ma<207>i of V<193>caspati<R>ç
		(15th Century <MS>A.<|>D.<D>)
@LEFT = 	T<200>rthas<193>ra of Dalapati<R>ç
		(circa <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1490)
@LEFT = 	Tristhal<200>setu of N<193>r<193>ya<207>abha<219><219>a<R>ç
		(<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1570)
Apart from these, there are separate treatises on individual places ç
like Gay<193> and Pur<200> also.
@SB = Purpose of T<200>rthay<193>tr<193>
T<200>rthay<193>tr<193>  has  been  listed  as one of the s<193>m<193>nyadharmas ç
(universal or common duties) by some of the scriptures like the Vi<218><207>udharmas<220>ktas ç
(2.16, 17). It is supposed to destroy one's sins, give religious merit ç
and result in purity of mind. Even the <184>gveda (10.75 khila) ç
refers to the holiness of the place where the white and the black ç
rivers (Ga<209>g<193> and Yamun<193>) merge. A bath here enables one ç
to go to heaven. One who drowns himself here attains am<216>tatva ç
or immortality. The pur<193><207>as abound in such ideas.
The beauty and grandeur of such places conducive to a mood of meditation, ç
as also association of spiritual giants who might have visited these ç
places earlier and a host of related ideas have endowed these places ç
of pilgrimage with spiritual vibrations. The etymological meaning ç
of the word `<200>rtha'†t<200>ryate anena iti t<200>rtha<221>, sa<221>s<193>ras<193>garatara<207>op<193>ya-bh<220>ta<221>; ç
`that by which it is crossed, that which helps in crossing the ocean ç
of transmigratory existence, is t<200>rtha'†also points towards this ç
conclusion.
That is why when people visit these places with the right attitude, ç
they are immensely benefited.

@SB = Classification of T<200>rthas
@SPACE = 
The Brahmapur<193><207>a (70.16-19) classifies the t<200>rthas or ç
places of pilgrimage into four groups:
@LEFT = 1.<+>daiva	those that are<R>ç
		created by gods.
@LEFT = 2.<+><193>sura	those associated with<R>ç
		asuras or demons, like Gaya.
@LEFT = 3.<+><193>r<218>a	Those established by <216><218>is or<R>ç
		sages, like Prabh<193>sa and<R>ç
		Nara-N<193>r<193>ya<207>a.
@LEFT = 4.<+>m<193>nu<218>a	those created by human<R>ç
		beings, kings like<R>ç
		Ambar<200><218>a, Manu and Kuru.
These four are assigned to the four yugas†K<216>ta, Tret<193>, Dv<193>para ç
and Kali† respectively (ibid 175.31-32).
However, this classification does not have much relevance to us today.
@SPACE = 
@SB = Eligibility for T<200>rthay<193>tr<193>
@SPACE = 
One of the questions that has often been discussed in the pur<193><207>as ç
and the dharma·<193>stras is that of adhik<193>ra or eligibility  for  t<200>rthay<193>tr<193>.  This  had ç
probably become necessary because study of the Vedas and performance ç
of the Vedic rituals had been restricted only to the dvijas (the `twice-born' ç
classes, viz., the members of the first three castes).
Unlike the study of the Vedas or performance of the Vedic rituals, ç
taking recourse to t<200>rthay<193>tr<193> is open to all human ç
beings irrespective of their caste, status or condition (vide Matsyapur<193><207>a ç
184.66, 67). The pur<193><207>as go to the extent of declaring that ç
those whotake a bath in a holy river or at a holy place will not ç
only attain liberation themselves but also purify sevengenerations ç
of their fore- fathers and descendants (V<193>manapur<193><207>a ç
36.78, 79).
Such hyperbolic eulogy was obviously meant to induce even the common ç
folk to undertake t<200>rthay<193>tr<193>.
Notwithstanding such liberal statements, some primary rules had also ç
been imposed on those intending to perform it.
For instance:
A brahmac<193>rin living in the guru's house had to take his permission.
Married persons were obliged to take their spouses also, failing which ç
they would not get the religious merit of the pilgrimage!
@SB = Ethical Life, a Precondition
Despite  eulogising  t<200>rthay<193>tr<193>  in order to attract ç
the common people, the sages of the pur<193><207>as did not fail to ç
stress the importance of a moral and ethical lifeas a precondition, ç
without which it would become futile. However, it was also conceded ç
that persons†even transgressors of dharma, and sinners†who undertake ç
t<200>rthay<193>tr<193> with faith, repent for their misdeeds and ç
resolve not to repeat them, will definitely be benefited by it (vide ç
V<193>yupur<193><207>a 77.125).
Though persons leading a pure life do not need to undertake pilgrimages, ç
they too will immensely be benefited in their spiritual evolution ç
if they do.
It is interesting to note that the practice of virtues like j<210><193>na ç
(scriptural knowledge), k<218>am<193> (forgiveness), day<193> (compassion) ç
and dama (self-control) are themselves `t<200>rtha,' since they are ç
conducive to purity of mind. So also the company of holy persons (devotees ç
of God V<193>sudeva).
@SB = Recommended Procedure
The pur<193><207>as and the dharma·<193>stras have laid  down  the  procedure  to  be ç
followed in t<200>rthay<193>tr<193>. The same may be briefly summarised ç
as follows:
Fasting on the previous day; worship of  the  family  deity,  Ga<207>apati,  and ç
Navagrahas and giving gifts to the poor and the needy on the day of ç
departure; wearing ochre-colored or yellow clothes; sa<209>kalpa or ç
religious resolve as dictated by the scriptures; giving up all articles ç
of luxury and leading a simple, austere, life during the pilgrimage; ç
after returning, repetition of the worship of the deities and offering ç
gifts as a mark of thanksgiving.
@SPACE1 = 
@SPACE1 = 
In the modern context when even pilgrimage has become a part of tourism ç
industry, one may just offer worship to the family deity, visit a ç
temple of the same (or of one's choice) and take the blessings of ç
the elders before starting. The same may be repeated after the successful ç
completion of the pilgrimage.
@SB = Pratinidhi System
In the olden days, it was a lifetime's ambition for every devoted ç
Hindu to visit K<193>·<200> (and other holy places) at least once. ç
However, during the times when transport and communication were extremely ç
difficult, even able-bodied persons could not easily make it. Then ç
what to speak of others handicapped by ill-health, lack of money, ç
old-age disabilities and so on!
@SPACE1 = 
For the benefit of such persons, the treatises on t<200>rthay<193>tr<193> ç
have given a unique method called `pratinidhi-kriy<193>'. According ç
to this, the person who is unable to perform the pilgrimage should ç
request someone who is going, to perform some rite like bathing in ç
the river Ga<209>g<193>, on his behalf also. After reaching the Ga<209>g<193> ç
river, the pilgrim prepares an image of straw (ku·a-grass) and immerses ç
it in the water with appropriate mantras. The person for whom this ç
proxy rite is performed is said to get a part of the religious merit ç
which he would have got if he had personally done it himself. (vide ç
Atrism<216>ti 50 and 51).

@SB = Epilogue
@SPACE1 = 
T<200>rthay<193>tr<193> or pilgrimage to holy places has been an integral ç
part of a Hindu's religious life. If people, both in the ancient and ç
in the medieval periods, were prepared to face all hardships and undertake ç
pilgrimages, it was their deep faith in the system that sustained ç
them. It also helped them to attain emotional integration with other ç
Hindus throughout the country.
