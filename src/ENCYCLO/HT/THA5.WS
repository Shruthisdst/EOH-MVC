The ten mantras of the three anuv<193>kas (sections)†38, 39 and 40†of ç
the Mah<193>n<193>r<193>ya<207>opani<218>ad are collectively known ç
as Trisupar<207>amantras. This has been declared in the Upani<218>ad ç
itself.
As Supar<207>a or Garu<195>a (the eagle-mount of Lord Vi<218><207>u) ç
protects am<216>ta or nectar, these mantras when recited will protect ç
a seeker of spiritual wisdom from the evil effects of even heinous ç
sins like brahmahaty<193> (killing a br<193>hma<207>a). Hence they ç
are called Supar<207>amantras. Since they are spread over three ç
(= tri) anu-v<193>kas, they are called Trisupar<207>amantras.
A brief summary of these mantras may now be given:
@S10 = Anuv<193>ka 38
May Brahman, the blissful Lord, come to me. O Lord! I am your child. ç
Destroy  my  bad  dream  of  sa<221>s<193>ra (empirical existence). ç
I offer myself as an oblation into Thee.
These Trisupar<207>amantras should be given to any br<193>hma<207>a, ç
even if unsolicited. Those who recite them, destroy the sin of brahmahaty<193> ç
or killing a br<193>hma<207>a. They become so pure that they can purify ç
a thousand br<193>hma<207>as, while sitting for food, in the same ç
row.
@S10 = Anuv<193>ka 39
Brahman who is bliss is attained through the power of intelligence.
O God the Creator! give us prosperity consisting of progeny. Turn ç
away from us this bad dream of the world.
Turn away from us all sins and bring to us what is auspicious.
May the whole nature consisting of wind, rivers, vegetation, night ç
and dawn, particles of earth and sun, be sweet to us.
@S10 = Anuv<193>ka 40
The (Supreme) Brahman is attained only by a person in whom the desire ç
for Self-knowledge is generated by the proper performance of prescribed ç
duties.
It is the Supreme Being who has become the best in everything: Brahm<193> ç
(the four-faced creator) among the gods;master of right words among ç
the composers; the seer among the intelligent beings; the strong buffalo ç
among the animals; the kite among the birds; the axe among the destructive ç
tools and soma juice that is praised, among the sacrificers.
@SPACE1 = 
It is He again who is in the sun, in the air, in the fire, as also ç
in the individual soul.
@NT = Trita
@SPACE = 
The sage Gautama had three sons known as Ekata, Dvita and Trita.
Once these three brothers went to a sacrifice, participated as priests ç
and got money. Trita got more than his brothers since he was more ç
competent. While returning home, the two elder brothers pushed Trita ç
into a well and ran away with his wealth. Trita prayed to the Vi·vedevas ç
(or A·vin<200>devat<193>s) and got out through their grace. He also ç
cursed his brothers to become wolves!
According to another version (vide Skandasv<193>mi's commentary ç
on <184>gveda 1.105.1) Trita fell into a well when pursued by wolves. ç
There, he saw a creeper, imagined it to be the soma creeper and mentally ç
performed a Soma sacrifice. Various gods, along with B<216>haspati ç
(their preceptor), appeared before him, granted him all the boons ç
he asked for and also rescued him.
The <184>gveda, in another place vide 8.47.15) mentions that Trita-°ptya ç
prayed to gods to be freed from the effects of baddreams. Hence this ç
mantra may be repeated as a sacred formula to ward off evil dreams.

The Ch<193>ndogya Upani<218>ad (6.2.3,4; 6.3.3) mentions that Brahman ç
(called `Sat' here) created three fundamental elements out of himself. ç
They are: tejas (fire), <193>pa (water) and anna (earth).
These three are the pure elements imperceptible to the senses.
Brahman then created the gross elements out of these, by the process ç
of triv<216>tkara<207>a or triplication. In this, half of one subtle ç
or s<220>k<218>ma element is combined with one-fourth of the other ç
two, resulting in the gross (sth<220>la) element as follows:

@EMERGENCY = This is a well-known place of pilgrimage in the Maharashtra ç

also.) It is here that the God<193>var<200> river takes its birth ç
(in the Brahmagiri hills). The temple of Lord <185>iva known as Tryambake·vara ç
is situated in the midst of three mountains†Brahma-giri, N<200>lagiri ç
and K<193>lagiri.
@EMERGENCY = The temple is fairly big. The garbha-g<216>ha  (sanctum)  contains  three  li<209>gas ç
representing Brahm<193>, Vi<218><207>u and <185>iva. They are among ç
the twelve jyotirli<209>gas (See <MS>JYOTIRLI<177>GAS.<D>). There ç

the water of which is used to bathe the li<209>gas.
The present temple structure is said to have been built by B<193>j<200> ç
Rao Pe<218>v<193> in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1730.
A big tank, 28 metres by 25 metres (94 feet by 85 feet), known as ç
Ku·<193>varta situated at a short distance from the temple is considered ç
very sacred.
The place abounds in t<200>rthas (holy tanks) like Bilvat<200>rtha, ç
Vi·van<193>that<200>rtha and Mukundat<200>rtha. There are also several ç

@NT = Tuk<193>r<193>m
@N1 = (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1598-1649)
@EMERGENCY = Tuk<193>r<193>m is one of the greatest mystic saint-poets   of   Maharashtra   whose ç
abha<209>gas (devotional songs in Mar<193><219>h<200>) (See <MS>ABHA<177>GAS.<D>), ç
which run into thousands, are popular even now.
@EMERGENCY = He was born at Dehu, a village 22<P8W1><$E1/2 > <P255D>kms. ç
(14 miles) away from the city of Pune. He belonged to the Mar<193><219>ha ç
caste considered by many as belonging to the ·<220>dra group.
@EMERGENCY = He was married at an early age but lost his wife and ç
a son as also his parents when a terrible famine ravaged the village. ç
He was married again, °va<202>i (or J<200>j<193>b<193>i) being the ç
name of his second wife.
Basically he was inclined towards a spiritual life through the path ç
of bhakti or devotion. Repeated failures in life intensified this ç
bent of mind. Hence he started studying religious works and spend ç
the time singing devotional songs. He received a mantra (holy name) ç
in dream from one B<193>b<193>j<200> Caitanya which mantra he started ç
repeating as much as possible. In another dream experience, N<193>mdev ç
(<MS>A.D.<D> 1270-1320), another great saint of Maharashtra, entrusted ç
him with the task of composing abha<209>gas, to complete his own unfinished ç
task.
@EMERGENCY = From now onwards, new abha<209>gas containing gems of ç
spiritual truths, started flowing from his mouth. Larger and larger ç
number of common people started taking part in his congregations of ç
devotional music and discourses.
This roused the jealousy and anger of the orthodox br<193>hma<207>as ç
who tried their best to harm him but were soon chastened and  converted  to  become  his  ardent ç
followers.
However,  these  detractors  once succeeded in forcing Tuk<193>r<193>m ç
to drown the manuscripts of his abha<209>gas in the Indr<193>ya<207><200> ç
river. But Lord P<193><207><195>ura<209>ga Vi<219><219>hala (a form ç
of K<216><218><207>a, popular in Maharashtra) restored them to their ç
true owner.
On  another  occasion,  Tuk<193>r<193>m miraculously saved the king ç
<185>iv<193>j<200> (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1627-1680) from being captured by ç
the Moghuls.
On the last day of his life, Tuk<193>r<193>m is said to have bodily ç
ascended to heaven in a divine chariot.
The  teachings  he  has  delivered, primarily through his abha<209>gas, ç
stress the importance of devotion to P<193><207><195>ura<209>ga Vi<219><219>hala, ç
the power of the divine name, the irrelevance of caste in spiritual ç
life and the futility of religious rituals.

@NT = Tul<193>dh<193>ra
A sage, J<193>jali by name, performed severe austerities and developed ç
a few powers because of which he became highly conceited. Then, a ç
few benevolent spirits advised him to go to Tul<193>dh<193>ra (a vai·ya ç
merchant) living in K<193>·<200>, for greater enlightenment.
When he approached Tul<193>dh<193>ra he was surprised to find that ç
he (the merchant) had already come to know everything about his tapas ç
as also his conceit. On being questioned about this, Tul<193>dh<193>ra ç
gave him a long discourse on true dharma.
The salient points of his teaching can be summarised as follows:
One should earn one's livelihood with least injury to other beings. ç
He should be a friend of all, with an equanimous temperament. He should ç
practise detachment, self-control and freedom from fear. Understanding ç
the correct nature of dharma and then practising it is the best way. ç

@NT = Tulaj<193>pur
This town is 25 kms. (15 miles) to the south of Osmanabad in Maharashtra. ç
It is celebrated for its temple of Tulaj<193>-bhav<193>n<200>, the ç
goddess who blessed <185>iv<193>j<200> (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1627-1680) with ç
the famous sword called `Bhav<193>ni'.
According to the Dev<200>bh<193>gavata (7.38.6) this is one of the ç
<185>aktip<200><219>has, places hallowed by the Dev<200>'s limbs which ç
fell at various places. (See <MS><185>AKTIP®<187>HAS.<D>)
In the main temple is the dark image of Bhav<193>n<200>. There is ç
a bronze icon of the lion (her v<193>hana or mount) kept in front ç
of the image.
Near this shrine is a well called `Kallolat<200>rtha.' It has a gomukha ç
(a spout) from which water is constantly coming out.
There are quite a few other temples here, dedicated to Bhav<193>n<200>·a<209>kara, ç
Ga<207>e·a, Datt<193>treya, K<193>labhairava, M<193>ta<209>gidev<200>, ç

@NT = tul<193>puru<218>a
@N1 = (`weighing a person in a <R>ç
balance [against gold]')
Hindu   scriptures   have   always considered d<193>na or giving gifts ç
to worthy and needy persons as an act of great religious merit.
Gifts of certain kinds are called mah<193>d<193>nas or great gifts. ç
(See <MS>MAH°-D°NAS.<D>) Out of them the tul<193>puru<218>a (or tul<193>bh<193>ra) ç
is also one. It consists mainly in weighing oneself against gold and ç
distributing it to the guru, the priests and other worthy persons.
The  whole  procedure  consists  of religious rites like homa (offering ç
oblations into a duly consecrated fire), worshipping the tul<193> ç
or the weighing scale specially set up and honouring the br<193>hma<207>as ç
as also poor and helpless people.
Obviously only great kings could perform it.
Gradually, weighing oneself against silver, camphor or other useful ç
materials and donating them came into vogue. This practice is seen, ç
sometimes, even now.

@NT = tulas<200>
@N1 = (`holy basil')
The tulas<200> is a small plant considered extremely sacred by the ç
Hindus, especially by the Vai<218><207>avas (followers of the Vi<218><207>u ç
cult). Its botanical name is Ocymum sanctum.
Three major varieties of this plant are: r<193>matulas<200>, k<216><218><207>atulas<200> ç
and ·r<200>tulas<200>.
According to another classification, there are six varieties: ·r<200>tulas<200>, ç
k<218>udrapatratulas<200>, raktatulas<200>, bilvagandhatulas<200>, ç
k<216><218>n<193>tulas<200> and varvaritulas<200>. Only experts in ç
the field can recognise them.
Tulas<200> is said to have been born out of the tears (of bliss) of ç
Vi<218><207>u at the time of the emerging of the am<216>takala·a (pot ç
of nectar) from the ocean which had been churned by the devas (gods) ç
and the d<193>navas (demons).
The tulas<200> leaves are extensively used in the ritualistic worship ç
of Vi<218><207>u and deities associated with Vi<218><207>u. The dried ç
wood of the plant is shaped into beads and rosaries are prepared out ç
of them to be used in japa (repetition of the divine name).
The dried sticks of this plant are also used in homas (fire-sacrifices).
While cremating a dead body, a few dried wood pieces are also used ç
along with the fuel. It is believed that the soul of the deceased ç
will go to higher regions by this holy act.
Almost every Hindu house has a b<216>nd<193>vana (See <MS>B<184>ND°VANA.<D>) ç
with a tulas<200> plant. It is worshipped daily by married women and ç
unmarried girls.
Tulas<200> leaves as also the juice extracted out of them have many ç
curative properties.
Tulas<200> is also one of the goddesses considered as a consort of ç
Vi<218><207>u.

Hinduism. It has also instilled life and power in the Hindu society ç
of its times.
@EMERGENCY = The immortal author of this monumental epic is Tulas<200>d<193>sa ç
(also spelt as Tuls<200>d<193>s).
According to the popular oral tradition he was born as the son of ç
°tm<193>r<193>m-dube and Hulas<200>†a br<193>hma<207>a couple†at an ç
inauspicious moment (in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1496, corresponding to the Vikrama·aka ç
1554) and hence was abandoned by the parents. He was brought up first ç
by an old servant maid and later by a beggar woman. When he was about ç
eight years old, a s<193>dhu (holy man), Narahari °nanda by name, ç
who saw him and recognised his inherent greatness, took him away to ç
his <193>·rama (monastery). He named the boy as R<193>mbol<193> and ç
started training him by narrating the story of R<193>m<193>ya<207>a. ç
At the time of his upanayana (initiation into Vedic studies and religious ç
life) R<193>mbol<193> was given the new name Tulas<200>d<193>sa by ç
his guru and mentor.
@EMERGENCY = Tulas<200>d<193>sa was then sent to K<193>·<200> for ç
higher education under <185>e<218>asan<193>tani, a great scholar and ç
an eminent teacher. After a vigorous course of education in the Vedic ç
lore and allied literature as also training in austere life, spread ç
over fifteen years, Tulas<200>d<193>sa returned to R<193>jpur, his ç
native place.
@EMERGENCY = There, he started spending much of his time in delivering ç
religious discourses based on the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a.
He was married to Ratn<193>val<200>, the learned and beautiful daughter ç
of a well-known astrologer D<200>nabandhup<193><219>haka. He was passionately ç
attached to her. However, this attachment got a rude shock by the ç
very person of his love, who admonished him and advised him to direct ç
his love towards the Lord <185>r<200> R<193>ma. As a result of  this  shock-treatment,  Tulas<200>d<193>sa ç
renounced the world then and there and came to K<193>·<200>. There ç
he started giving discourses on the R<193>m<193>ya<207>a which became ç
extremely popular.
@SPACE1 =

(who is supposed to be a cira<210>j<200>vi, living eternally in a ç
subtle body) and have the dar·an (seeing) of <185>r<200> R<193>ma.
As per the direction given by Lord <185>iva in a vision, he went to ç
Ayodhy<193> and started writing his magnum opus, the R<193>macaritam<193>nasa ç
(or R<193>mcaritm<193>nas), in the local Hindi dialect called Avadh<200>. ç
It was completed in about two and a half years.
The excellence of this composition roused the jealousy of other scholars ç
who tried their best to harm him but failed miserably.
He now started the real work of his life, of spreading R<193>ma's ç
story and his powerful name. He also organised the youth of his times ç
to become strong, both physically and morally, by starting a number ç
of akh<193><195>as (native gymnasia) and recruiting them. Hanum<193>n ç
was projected as their hero. He also built a number of temples of ç
Hanum<193>n.
He passed away at the ripe old age of 126 years in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1622 ç
at the Sa<209>ka<219>-mocan-gh<193><219> (a place for bathing) on ç
the bank of the river Ga<209>g<193> in K<193>·<200>.
Apart from the R<193>macaritam<193>nasa, eleven more works were ç
written by him. Among them the following are more well- known. Vinayapatrik<193>, ç
Kavit<193>val<200> and Doh<193>val<200>.
The Vinayapatrik<193> is in the form of a petition to the king R<193>ma ç
seeking protection from the threats of Kali (the Master of the Iron ç
Age).
The Doh<193>val<200> is a work of verses of two lines containing ç
the teachings of the author based on his experiences, interspersed ç
with the story of R<193>m<193>ya<207>a.
The Kavit<193>val<200> is in a language which is a mixture of Avadh<200> ç
and Brajbh<193><218><193> (variants of Hindi). It is based on the ç
main work R<193>macaritam<193>nasa and acts as a supplementary.

by R<193>ma, he regained his original form (vide R<193>m<193>ya<207>a, ç
Ara<207>ya-k<193><207><195>a 4.16-18).
@NT = tur<200>ya
@N1 = (`the fourth')
Treatises on Advaita Ved<193>nta take recourse to a method called ç
`avasth<193>traya-viveka' (`analysis of the three states of consciousness') ç
to prove the existence of the <193>tman (the individual soul) as pure ç
consciousness beyond the body-mind complex. Since it persists through ç
all the three states of consciousness†j<193>grat (waking state), svapna ç
(dream state) and su<218>upti (deep-sleep state)†it is called the ç
`tur<200>ya' or `the fourth'.

is prak<216>titu<218><219>i.

@N1 = (`the shaper')
According to the <184>gveda (1.20.6), Tva<218><219><193> is an artisan ç
of the gods. Later, he is identified with Vi·vakarma (vide Vi<218><207>upur<193><207>a ç
3.2.11).
He is counted among the twelve °dityas born to the sage Ka·yapa in ç
Aditi.
Racan<193>, the daughter of Prahl<193>da, was his wife.
Tri·iras or Vi·var<220>pa was his son who had been chosen by Indra ç
to be the priest of the gods (See <MS>VI<185>VAR<188>PA<D> for details.). ç
He was ultimately killed by Indra.
Sa<221>j<210><193>, the eldest wife of S<220>rya (the Sun-god) was ç
his daughter.
@NT = ty<193>ga
@N1 = (`giving up')
Ty<193>ga or giving up is an important concept found in the Hindu ç
scriptures.
It has two aspects: giving away something to someone who needs it ç
more; giving up an object feeling that it is not a necessity or even ç
an obstacle to the way of life one has chosen.
The former is known as d<193>na (See <MS>D°NA<D> for details.) and ç
the latter as vair<193>gya (renunciation). D<193>na has been prescribed ç
as a duty for the householders. Vair<193>gya is an essential qualification ç
forone who aspires after sa<221>ny<193>sa or monastic life.
The Manusm<216>ti (8.389) forbids a householder from giving up his ç
parents, wife and sons who depend upon him.
The Bhagavadg<200>t<193> (18.2) gives a general definition of ty<193>ga ç
as giving up the fruits of all actions. It then categorises the ty<193>ga ç
of actions into three types: s<193>ttvika, r<193>jasika and t<193>masika.
S<193>ttvika-ty<193>ga consists in performing one's prescribed duties ç
but giving up attachment towards them as also the fruits thereof.
Giving up one's prescribed duties because they entail a lot of physical ç
exertion is r<193>jasika-ty<193>ga.
If the same is done out of delusion or confused understanding, it ç
is t<193>masika-ty<193>ga (vide Bhagavadg<200>t<193> 18.7-9).
The Bhagavadg<200>t<193>, however, unequivocally declares that works ç
like yaj<210>a (sacrifice), d<193>na (giving gifts) and tapas (austerities) ç
should not be given up, but, must be performed. They always have a ç
purifying effect.
@NT = Ty<193>gar<193>ja
@N1 = (<MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1767-1848)
Ty<193>gar<193>ja is one of the all-time great musician saints of ç
India. The Carnatic music†classical music of South Indian tradition†has ç
been immensely benefited and enriched by his soulful compositions. ç
Side by side, he also contributed greatly to the cult of devotion ç
to R<193>ma.
Ty<193>gar<193>ja was born in <MS>A.<|>D.<D> 1767 atTiruv<193>r<220>r ç
in the Ta<210>j<193>v<220>r (Tanjore) district of Tamil Nadu in a ç
Telugu-speaking br<193>hma<207>a family. His parents were R<193>mabrahma ç
and S<200>t<193>mb<193>. Since Tiruv<193>r<220>r was famous for its ç
temple of Lord <185>iva, known as Ty<193>gar<193>jasv<193>min, the ç
boy was named Ty<193>gar<193>jabrahma.
Later  on,  the  family  shifted  to Tiruvayy<193>r, also called Pa<210>canadak<218>etra.
Ty<193>gar<193>ja was given a good education especially in Sanskrit ç
and Telugu. He also became proficient in some other fields of knowledge ç
like the Vedas, pur<193><207>as, jyauti<218>a  (astrology)  and  ga<207>ita<|> ç
(mathematics).
He was initiated by one R<193>mak<216><218><207><193>-nandasv<193>min ç
with a special mantra of R<193>ma.
Endowed with a good voice and memory, Ty<193>gar<193>ja had a flair ç
for music. The devotional songs of Purandarad<193>sa (<MS>A.D.<D> ç
1484-1564), Bhadr<193>calam R<193>mad<193>sa (<MS>A.D.<D> 1630-1687) ç
and others, which his mother used to sing, deeply influenced him. ç
He started composing songs even from a young-age.
Recognising his talents, his father arranged for his music-training ç
under So<207><219>hi Ve<209>ka<219>arama<207>ayya, the topmost musician ç
of his times. Very soon, he excelled in it.
He is said to have been blessed by the sage N<193>rada who came disguised ç
as a sa<221>ny<193>sin and left an ancient treatise on music†the Svar<193>r<207>ava†with ç
him. Ty<193>gar<193>ja mastered it very soon.
@SPACE1 = 
He was married to P<193>rvat<200>, at the age of eighteen. After her ç
early demise, he married her younger sister Kamal<193>.
Ty<193>gar<193>ja was once blessed by a sage who advised him to repeat ç
R<193>man<193>ma (mantra of R<193>ma) 96 crore times, which he did ç
faithfully, completing it in about twenty-one years. He succeeded ç
in getting a vision of <185>r<200> R<193>ma several times.
He is supposed to have composed 24,000 songs though only 800 are available ç
now.
He lived by u<210>chav<216>tti (gathering corn left in agricultural ç
fields). The people of the town who respected him greatly, also supported ç
him. Though kings and noblemen invited him to their courts he flatly ç
refused their invitations.
Only once, he went on a pilgrimage to a few places in South India, ç
like Tirupati, K<193><210>cipuram, Madurai and <185>r<200>ra<209>gam.
Though a few miracles, like bringing back a dead person to life, have ç
been attributed to him, he considered them as having happened by the ç
grace of R<193>ma.
He took sa<221>ny<193>sa during the last days and passed away peacefully ç
whilehis disciples were chanting the name of R<193>ma.
His songs†most of which are in Telugu and a few in Sanskrit†though ç
imbued with intense devotional fervour, are also classics even from ç
the standpoint of literary merit.<R>ç

His other compositions are: Prahl<193>da-bhaktivijayam, Nauk<193>caritram ç
and S<200>t<193>-r<193>mavijayam. These are called geya- n<193><219>akas, ç
which can be enacted as dramas with plenty of music.
His gurukula (traditional academy for teaching) produced a good number ç
of great musicians who continued his tradition of music.
His sam<193>dhi (the place where his body has been interred) has been ç
well-preserved even today. The day of his passing away (called pu<207>y<193>r<193>dhana) ç
is observed with special worship and singing of his songs by great ç
musicians.
